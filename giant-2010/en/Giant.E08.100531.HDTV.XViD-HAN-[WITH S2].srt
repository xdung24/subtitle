00:00:10,673 --> 00:00:12,538
Is Lee Gangmo still not here?

6
00:00:23,715 --> 00:00:25,015
<i>Seonsaengnim.</i>

7
00:00:25,183 --> 00:00:27,547
It is time to start the test.

8
00:00:27,654 --> 00:00:28,884
Right...

9
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,968
First row, pass down the test.

10
00:00:34,038 --> 00:00:35,421
<i>What's this?</i>

11
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:43,899
Open the door.

12
00:00:44,621 --> 00:00:45,921
Jeongyeon!

13
00:00:46,967 --> 00:00:48,305
Ajumma!

14
00:00:48,404 --> 00:00:50,096
<i>Jeongyeon!</i>

15
00:00:51,167 --> 00:00:52,081
Ajumma!

16
00:00:52,165 --> 00:00:53,438
Open the door.

17
00:00:53,537 --> 00:00:54,936
Quick!

18
00:00:56,683 --> 00:00:57,390
Hey...

19
00:00:57,495 --> 00:00:58,731
What are you doing there?

20
00:00:58,812 --> 00:01:00,319
Please open the door, Ajumma.

21
00:01:00,414 --> 00:01:01,303
Quick!

22
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:04,203
Aigoo... Really...

23
00:01:12,613 --> 00:01:15,260
What's wrong with him?

24
00:01:39,528 --> 00:01:41,296
Gangmo.

25
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:55,147
Just sit.

26
00:01:55,608 --> 00:01:58,191
You almost missed the test.

27
00:01:59,863 --> 00:02:00,585
Here.

28
00:02:00,681 --> 00:02:02,866
<i>You have an hour to complete it.</i>

29
00:02:03,263 --> 00:02:07,126
You'll have to 
take this test here, today.

30
00:02:56,487 --> 00:02:58,004
<i>Go in!</i>

31
00:03:14,386 --> 00:03:17,365
Try anything funny 
and you might get killed.

32
00:03:19,097 --> 00:03:21,142
Keep quiet.

33
00:03:33,763 --> 00:03:36,165
What happened, Hyung?

34
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,487
I could ask you the same thing.

35
00:03:38,643 --> 00:03:42,349
Haven't you heard I disappeared 
while on a mission?

36
00:03:42,433 --> 00:03:43,829
I did hear about it,

37
00:03:43,949 --> 00:03:47,054
but I never imagined
that spies could capture you.

38
00:03:47,788 --> 00:03:50,976
We must find a way to escape from here.

39
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:55,577
I don't think those people are spies.

40
00:03:56,559 --> 00:03:57,504
What?

41
00:03:57,762 --> 00:04:00,373
Something doesn't feel right.

42
00:04:00,748 --> 00:04:03,551
There is no way the KCIA
wouldn't know about my disappearance,

43
00:04:03,683 --> 00:04:06,451
and the fact that they gave us
the same task is strange as well.

44
00:04:07,762 --> 00:04:09,411
Then, are you telling me...

45
00:04:10,313 --> 00:04:13,372
I'm sure we're just being tested.

46
00:04:13,483 --> 00:04:16,646
Whatever happens, 
we must endure it until the end.

47
00:04:18,018 --> 00:04:21,340
Director Min, you rotten bastard...

48
00:04:36,221 --> 00:04:38,038
Come on in, Chief Jo.

49
00:04:38,256 --> 00:04:40,516
I have the scores for your
associates' aptitude test.

50
00:04:40,637 --> 00:04:42,129
They did quite well.

51
00:04:42,273 --> 00:04:44,930
Particularly that Lee Seongmo.

52
00:04:45,037 --> 00:04:48,563
What kind of test 
did you put them through?

53
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,575
Didn't I tell you 
we'd test their operational skills?

54
00:04:56,862 --> 00:04:58,295
Are you telling me you didn't know?

55
00:04:58,403 --> 00:05:01,303
Not only I lost contact with Lee Seongmo, 
but now Go Jaechun as well.

56
00:05:01,424 --> 00:05:04,215
What test could it possibly be...

57
00:05:07,127 --> 00:05:08,523
So?

58
00:05:09,096 --> 00:05:11,731
Are you here to complain, or something?

59
00:05:12,733 --> 00:05:14,194
Let's be clear.

60
00:05:14,304 --> 00:05:16,328
I'm your superior.

61
00:05:16,556 --> 00:05:19,312
I'm in charge of recruiting agents here.

62
00:05:19,805 --> 00:05:22,717
How dare you come in
and stare at me like that?

63
00:05:23,804 --> 00:05:25,532
<i>Just wait for the final results.</i>

64
00:05:26,191 --> 00:05:28,252
Come bothering me for that again,

65
00:05:28,396 --> 00:05:32,270
and I'll stake my life to get you fired.

66
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:50,218
Thought I'd let them 
do whatever you wanted?

67
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,793
You insolent prick...

68
00:06:10,122 --> 00:06:11,458
It's a relief.

69
00:06:11,679 --> 00:06:14,406
I was worried you wouldn't make it.

70
00:06:17,253 --> 00:06:20,946
<i>Here's the list of questions
for the upcoming midterms.</i>

71
00:06:21,031 --> 00:06:22,619
<i>Yes...</i>

72
00:06:27,528 --> 00:06:30,806
Seems like you did 
your best to beat me,

73
00:06:30,913 --> 00:06:33,868
but now that you have no more excuses, 
what will you do?

74
00:06:35,202 --> 00:06:36,934
You coward...

75
00:06:37,849 --> 00:06:39,244
What?

76
00:06:43,022 --> 00:06:45,281
You little fool...

77
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,231
You must be out of your mind.

78
00:07:00,436 --> 00:07:04,269
Your teacher shows some 
interest in you out of compassion,

79
00:07:04,408 --> 00:07:06,439
and you forget who you're talking to?

80
00:07:06,576 --> 00:07:07,835
Yeah...

81
00:07:08,229 --> 00:07:10,679
Seems like I've forgotten.

82
00:07:10,778 --> 00:07:11,952
Why?

83
00:07:17,262 --> 00:07:20,122
The teacher is coming.

84
00:07:31,761 --> 00:07:33,664
Confess, you prick!

85
00:07:36,111 --> 00:07:38,752
Stop wasting our time and do it!

86
00:07:44,106 --> 00:07:45,610
Water.

87
00:08:11,709 --> 00:08:13,490
Tired, aren't you?

88
00:08:14,308 --> 00:08:18,107
I'll send you to sleep,
so just write it down.

89
00:08:19,142 --> 00:08:20,610
<i>Position.</i>

90
00:08:20,912 --> 00:08:23,197
Superior in charge.

91
00:08:23,655 --> 00:08:25,519
Your name.

92
00:08:31,568 --> 00:08:33,523
I said write it down!

93
00:08:34,883 --> 00:08:37,818
Who sent you here?

94
00:08:46,241 --> 00:08:51,532
<i>You must never reveal your identity,
no matter how desperate the situation.</i>

95
00:08:53,509 --> 00:08:58,550
I know nothing.

96
00:08:59,332 --> 00:09:02,701
I merely brought you that envelope.

97
00:09:06,696 --> 00:09:07,911
What?

98
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:10,003
They still refuse to cave in?

99
00:09:10,173 --> 00:09:11,483
I apologize.

100
00:09:11,669 --> 00:09:14,389
You won't imagine 
how stubborn they are...

101
00:09:14,989 --> 00:09:17,745
- We should just accept their...
- You fool!

102
00:09:19,504 --> 00:09:21,529
Are you kidding me?

103
00:09:21,636 --> 00:09:22,666
I'll take that back.

104
00:09:22,774 --> 00:09:25,660
They didn't even open that envelope.

105
00:09:25,961 --> 00:09:29,041
We tried to contain Jo Pilyeon,
and only ended up benefiting him.

106
00:09:29,138 --> 00:09:31,767
Imagine if the higher-ups learn of this.

107
00:09:31,941 --> 00:09:34,698
It'll be a disgrace for us, a disgrace!

108
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:36,333
I apologize.

109
00:09:39,977 --> 00:09:41,701
Since they refuse to give up,

110
00:09:41,842 --> 00:09:45,331
do everything it takes to make them fail.

111
00:09:46,414 --> 00:09:48,160
They're human beings after all,

112
00:09:48,281 --> 00:09:51,268
a week without water and food 
and they'll call it quits.

113
00:09:51,744 --> 00:09:53,226
Mess this up,

114
00:09:53,337 --> 00:09:55,183
and I'll kill you with my own hands.

115
00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:56,310
Is that clear?

116
00:09:56,466 --> 00:09:59,276
Yes, Sir.

117
00:10:17,315 --> 00:10:18,906
Chief Jo.

118
00:10:19,303 --> 00:10:20,939
Good job.

119
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,997
Where are my boys?

120
00:10:23,502 --> 00:10:25,596
And why are you asking me...

121
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:33,860
What are you trying to do?

122
00:10:33,948 --> 00:10:35,565
Bought a house last year, right?

123
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:39,721
And some land in Gangnam,
under your six-year-old nephew's name.

124
00:10:40,178 --> 00:10:44,546
Never imagined you'd become 
my first case on the job.

125
00:10:44,642 --> 00:10:47,057
I see you took money 
on several instances.

126
00:10:47,145 --> 00:10:52,479
With this kind of figures, 
Director Min will just try to get rid of you.

127
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:56,737
Help me out, Chief.

128
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:59,439
Tell me.

129
00:10:59,752 --> 00:11:02,423
Where are my boys?

130
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:36,139
We'll let you feast on this all you want,

131
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:39,340
so write it down.

132
00:12:09,432 --> 00:12:11,092
Chief!

133
00:12:17,021 --> 00:12:20,482
We're testing their oper...

134
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,905
<i>Come on in.</i>

135
00:12:32,171 --> 00:12:34,588
I have something to tell...

136
00:12:36,321 --> 00:12:39,013
<i>I was just briefed by Director Min.</i>

137
00:12:39,138 --> 00:12:43,955
So I hear we found two men
of remarkable disposition?!

138
00:12:47,938 --> 00:12:49,298
Congrats.

139
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:52,053
You've got quite the 
talented fellas under you.

140
00:12:54,042 --> 00:12:56,004
It must have been painful to endure,

141
00:12:56,187 --> 00:12:59,337
but gaining experience in advance 
will always pay off.

142
00:13:00,901 --> 00:13:06,424
Since that's the kind of work you'll
have to do, for the sake of this country.

143
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:08,843
<i>Thank you.</i>

144
00:13:10,059 --> 00:13:11,631
Thanks to you,

145
00:13:11,815 --> 00:13:17,507
my men passed the elite
officer test with flying colors.

146
00:13:19,624 --> 00:13:23,659
I'll have to treat you
and pay back the courtesy.

147
00:13:25,001 --> 00:13:27,341
Don't really need to bother.

148
00:13:27,882 --> 00:13:29,498
If you'll excuse me.

149
00:13:31,336 --> 00:13:32,865
Also...

150
00:13:34,742 --> 00:13:39,035
I'll be in charge of their polygraph test.

151
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:40,960
Be my guest.

152
00:13:54,012 --> 00:13:57,874
Seongmo can still smell a rat 
like it's nobody's business.

153
00:13:58,208 --> 00:13:59,450
You did well.

154
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:01,817
Here... Have a drink.

155
00:14:05,294 --> 00:14:06,882
I...

156
00:14:07,369 --> 00:14:10,504
What does this polygraph measure?

157
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,324
Just your sense of patriotism,
and your mental state.

158
00:14:14,513 --> 00:14:17,533
Just answer honestly whatever I ask, 
and it'll be all.

159
00:14:23,164 --> 00:14:24,500
Why?

160
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:27,429
Are you hiding something from me?

161
00:14:27,649 --> 00:14:29,468
Nothing of the sort.

162
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:32,017
Here... Let's drink.

163
00:14:39,705 --> 00:14:42,997
This place is filled with charming ladies.

164
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:46,084
You can spend the night here.

165
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:47,989
Yes.

166
00:15:03,148 --> 00:15:05,049
Are you sleeping?

167
00:15:06,061 --> 00:15:09,743
You're really something...
Not even stealing a glance at me.

168
00:15:09,954 --> 00:15:13,714
Aren't you taking off my clothes?

169
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:26,803
You looked quite young...

170
00:15:26,983 --> 00:15:30,112
You're not telling me
it's your first time, are you?

171
00:15:33,758 --> 00:15:36,470
<i>{\a6}*archaic for partner</i>

172
00:15:33,758 --> 00:15:36,470
Seobangnim*...

173
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:42,542
I'm just fine, so please leave.

174
00:15:43,172 --> 00:15:45,113
You don't like me?

175
00:15:45,241 --> 00:15:47,687
I said leave!

176
00:16:12,564 --> 00:16:14,664
<i>I miss you.</i>

177
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:18,899
<i>I miss you so much,
it's driving me crazy.</i>

178
00:16:56,605 --> 00:16:58,819
Oppa!

179
00:16:59,505 --> 00:17:01,184
Miju!

180
00:17:01,528 --> 00:17:03,224
Aigoo...

181
00:17:04,847 --> 00:17:05,533
Miju.

182
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:07,066
We made a ton of money.

183
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:07,914
Really?

184
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:10,382
Then, are we going to live together now?

185
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:12,871
Of course! 
We'll never have to separate again.

186
00:17:12,979 --> 00:17:14,965
Oppa...

187
00:17:37,168 --> 00:17:39,671
Oppa...

188
00:18:10,398 --> 00:18:12,376
God.

189
00:18:12,593 --> 00:18:19,984
I don't care if my brothers
don't make a ton of money,

190
00:18:20,188 --> 00:18:22,992
so just let us meet.

191
00:18:25,073 --> 00:18:28,928
Make sure Big Oppa and Little Oppa...

192
00:18:29,294 --> 00:18:32,164
can live together with me,

193
00:18:32,453 --> 00:18:36,039
and have a happy life.

194
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:41,044
Uh? God...

195
00:18:54,512 --> 00:18:58,517
The top score in the entire school 
is again from our class.

196
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:06,639
The top scorer in our latest midterms...

197
00:19:10,505 --> 00:19:12,683
is Jo Minwoo.

198
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:27,580
But we have another top scorer.

199
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,694
Lee Gangmo.

200
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:34,870
What?!

201
00:19:35,026 --> 00:19:39,045
You and Jo Minwoo scored the same.

202
00:19:47,684 --> 00:19:52,541
<i>I'm really happy that our class 
had the two top scorers.</i>

203
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:57,294
If you all give your best, 
you can end up first like Gangmo did.

204
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:59,171
Dismissed.

205
00:20:16,509 --> 00:20:19,399
Starting today, 
we'll divide chores by groups,

206
00:20:19,534 --> 00:20:21,514
and assign the toilets 
based on student number.

207
00:20:21,611 --> 00:20:25,076
What are you, giving orders
to the class president?

208
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,616
Didn't you say it yourself?

209
00:20:26,736 --> 00:20:29,226
That if I ended up first,
I would decide the rules.

210
00:20:29,338 --> 00:20:30,465
Were you the only one on top?

211
00:20:30,586 --> 00:20:32,631
He was first just like you.

212
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:34,376
That's enough, stop it.

213
00:20:34,508 --> 00:20:37,030
Are you putting on airs
after just one first place?

214
00:20:37,117 --> 00:20:39,272
I said stop it!

215
00:20:44,049 --> 00:20:45,784
What now?

216
00:20:45,964 --> 00:20:50,548
I have no intention of
changing my own rules?!

217
00:20:50,837 --> 00:20:52,397
Too bad, then.

218
00:20:52,503 --> 00:20:54,844
We'll have to let 
a majority vote decide for us.

219
00:20:55,205 --> 00:20:56,274
A majority vote?!

220
00:20:56,394 --> 00:20:59,443
That's right.
We'll let them decide.

221
00:20:59,573 --> 00:21:01,171
How does it sound?

222
00:21:02,182 --> 00:21:03,842
Go ahead.

223
00:21:05,358 --> 00:21:10,285
Anyone who agrees with
my proposal, raise your hand.

224
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:21,450
We should decide 
our class rules all together.

225
00:21:21,584 --> 00:21:25,146
You've had it with 
cleaning every day, right?

226
00:21:27,664 --> 00:21:29,228
See?

227
00:21:29,565 --> 00:21:31,924
Nothing left to say, right?

228
00:21:39,776 --> 00:21:42,700
<i>"The grass is lying flat."</i>

229
00:21:50,185 --> 00:21:53,592
<i>~ Kim Suyoung's "Grass" ~</i>

230
00:22:04,051 --> 00:22:06,301
Remember this poem, right?

231
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:08,367
What did the teacher say?

232
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:10,857
That once you witness injustice, 
you should fight it!

233
00:22:11,018 --> 00:22:13,833
And that doing it 
will help us protect our rights.

234
00:22:17,124 --> 00:22:18,807
Are you all deaf?

235
00:22:18,941 --> 00:22:21,140
Why can't you admit 
that something is wrong?

236
00:22:21,253 --> 00:22:24,993
How much longer are you going to
let them subject you to this, you fools?

237
00:22:27,508 --> 00:22:30,173
Don't ever badmouth
Jo Minwoo behind his back.

238
00:22:30,297 --> 00:22:33,132
You don't even deserve that.

239
00:22:34,884 --> 00:22:36,429
I...

240
00:22:37,025 --> 00:22:40,556
agree with what Gangmo said.

241
00:22:45,557 --> 00:22:47,962
I... agree, too.

242
00:22:48,732 --> 00:22:50,363
Agreed.

243
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:53,264
I've had it with cleaning the toilets.

244
00:22:53,376 --> 00:22:56,396
- Me, too.
- Me too.

245
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:03,209
- Me too.
- Me, too.

246
00:23:10,468 --> 00:23:14,294
From here on in,
you clean like the others.

247
00:23:18,589 --> 00:23:20,935
Gangmo!

248
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:24,415
Gangmo, wait for me!

249
00:23:24,558 --> 00:23:27,015
Gangmo!

250
00:23:30,189 --> 00:23:32,009
First place!

251
00:23:32,153 --> 00:23:34,956
<i>~ Mokryeon Girls Middle School ~</i>

252
00:23:45,349 --> 00:23:47,011
Jeongyeon!

253
00:23:47,225 --> 00:23:48,611
What are you doing here?

254
00:23:48,804 --> 00:23:51,380
<i>We'll go ahead first.</i>

255
00:23:52,575 --> 00:23:54,886
You're embarrassing me,
coming all the way here...

256
00:23:54,994 --> 00:23:57,101
I ended first!
Top of the school!

257
00:23:57,258 --> 00:23:58,015
Really?

258
00:23:58,136 --> 00:23:59,399
Yeah.

259
00:23:59,814 --> 00:24:01,173
Here.

260
00:24:02,914 --> 00:24:04,130
Wow!

261
00:24:04,226 --> 00:24:06,978
You're really great!

262
00:24:08,229 --> 00:24:10,058
So, Minwoo?

263
00:24:10,251 --> 00:24:11,478
Uh?!

264
00:24:11,743 --> 00:24:13,243
Jo Minwoo.

265
00:24:13,403 --> 00:24:14,943
Was he second?

266
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:16,708
No.

267
00:24:16,846 --> 00:24:18,338
We both were first.

268
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:21,148
Ahh... So you had the same score?

269
00:24:21,263 --> 00:24:23,067
He's quite something, too...

270
00:24:23,187 --> 00:24:25,504
He never loses first place.

271
00:24:25,641 --> 00:24:27,482
He's just a bastard.

272
00:24:27,639 --> 00:24:28,963
Why?

273
00:24:31,645 --> 00:24:36,001
What are you, jealous
because I complimented him?

274
00:24:36,193 --> 00:24:38,525
What am I, some kid?
Being jealous and all...

275
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:44,513
It's much more impressive for someone 
who was dead last to end first.

276
00:24:44,753 --> 00:24:47,027
Let's go, I'll buy you pastries.

277
00:24:51,527 --> 00:24:53,573
I said let's go.

278
00:25:01,048 --> 00:25:02,036
Take your time.

279
00:25:02,132 --> 00:25:05,176
- I'll buy you more.
- Thank you, president.

280
00:25:05,669 --> 00:25:09,255
<i>- What could we do without you?
- Thanks for treating us.</i>

281
00:25:19,415 --> 00:25:23,482
Ajumma, some steamed buns
over there as well.

282
00:25:25,296 --> 00:25:27,961
I'm treating, so eat all you want.

283
00:25:28,701 --> 00:25:29,969
Whatever.

284
00:25:30,064 --> 00:25:34,020
Ajumma. Forget the buns,
and make us some dumplings.

285
00:25:36,689 --> 00:25:39,570
Let's go to the movies this Saturday.

286
00:25:41,201 --> 00:25:42,380
Forgot my promise?

287
00:25:42,501 --> 00:25:46,194
I told you I'd take you 
to the movies, if you ended first.

288
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,512
<i>Hwang Jeongyeon.</i>

289
00:26:06,307 --> 00:26:10,398
I think I will have to
take you to the movies.

290
00:26:10,578 --> 00:26:11,902
What?

291
00:26:13,402 --> 00:26:14,763
Lee Gangmo.

292
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:16,857
Eat all you want.

293
00:26:17,067 --> 00:26:22,043
As this is the last time you'll go
around bragging that you ended first.

294
00:26:23,968 --> 00:26:26,772
If you're done, let's get up.

295
00:26:31,984 --> 00:26:33,464
What's wrong with him?

296
00:26:33,618 --> 00:26:36,303
No idea.
Don't want to know, either.

297
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:46,010
I apologize.

298
00:26:46,198 --> 00:26:49,607
I wasn't aware of that.

299
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:51,913
How are you going to deal with this?

300
00:26:52,058 --> 00:26:54,175
I'll take care of everything,

301
00:26:54,308 --> 00:26:57,565
so you don't need to worry.

302
00:26:58,469 --> 00:26:59,814
Anyhow,

303
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:02,513
I'll be counting on you.

304
00:27:02,737 --> 00:27:08,908
And about that 
funding issue we discussed...

305
00:27:09,101 --> 00:27:11,833
I already talked with my husband.

306
00:27:12,868 --> 00:27:15,828
Thank you, Ma'am.

307
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:26,198
Is this all you could sell?

308
00:27:26,295 --> 00:27:28,000
I mean, that...

309
00:27:28,148 --> 00:27:31,288
Aigoo, don't even 
get me started, Director.

310
00:27:31,433 --> 00:27:33,887
They first sold that land
for two thousand won,

311
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:36,041
would they accept buying it back 
for fifteen thousand?

312
00:27:36,149 --> 00:27:37,777
He managed this much 
only because it's him,

313
00:27:37,873 --> 00:27:40,087
anyone else wouldn't have had 
any hope to begin with.

314
00:27:40,207 --> 00:27:44,336
The moment they start buying,
the price will only go up.

315
00:27:44,443 --> 00:27:47,005
If not us, who else would ever
sell land in Gangnam at that price?

316
00:27:47,138 --> 00:27:50,398
If those country bumpkins
living in Maljukgeori knew that,

317
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:52,855
would things have gotten to this point?

318
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:56,395
Sell them all by the end of the week.

319
00:27:56,894 --> 00:27:59,607
Director.

320
00:28:00,064 --> 00:28:04,404
Can't you give us a 
higher commission fee?

321
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:06,991
If you don't like it,
then forget about it.

322
00:28:07,123 --> 00:28:08,724
I'll go sell it myself.

323
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,264
No, Director!

324
00:28:10,372 --> 00:28:12,995
He's the only one
who can sell at 15,000 won!

325
00:28:13,585 --> 00:28:14,756
Oh my...

326
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:17,623
If you're done talking, just go.

327
00:28:18,188 --> 00:28:20,364
We'll sell it all by the end of the week.

328
00:28:20,497 --> 00:28:22,313
- Let's go!
- I apologize, Director...

329
00:28:22,438 --> 00:28:25,817
Aigoo, you brat! I knew
that you'd cause me trouble!

330
00:28:25,925 --> 00:28:28,139
Let's get going!

331
00:28:29,138 --> 00:28:32,898
We'll have to head to City Hall.

332
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:43,086
I truly appreciated what you did for us 
regarding the government building grant.

333
00:28:43,258 --> 00:28:46,002
You were the first to
get the higher-ups in line.

334
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,759
I really did nothing much.

335
00:28:47,903 --> 00:28:52,199
I had to do at least that much,
to let you work in peace.

336
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:56,953
Anyhow, that lobby power of yours 
never fails to amaze me.

337
00:28:57,065 --> 00:28:59,669
It is no lobbying, just negotiations.

338
00:28:59,765 --> 00:29:02,278
That is how I see it.

339
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:05,673
Yes.

340
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:15,614
Then, if you'll excuse me, 
I'll get going.

341
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:22,164
I might have lost with the landfill,

342
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:25,987
but this time I won't
make the same mistake.

343
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:27,948
Excuse me.

344
00:29:35,336 --> 00:29:36,813
Commissioner.

345
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:41,675
We are ready to contribute
to the national development fund.

346
00:29:42,385 --> 00:29:44,611
We'll hand you all the money you need,

347
00:29:44,755 --> 00:29:48,720
so allow me to meet
Congressman Oh Byeongtak.

348
00:29:49,965 --> 00:29:51,094
Listen, Director Hwang...

349
00:29:51,166 --> 00:29:56,112
Why is it possible for Hong,
and not for me?

350
00:29:56,311 --> 00:29:58,711
May I give you a piece of advice?

351
00:29:59,541 --> 00:30:05,208
For a businessman to mention things
like the national development fund in vain,

352
00:30:05,618 --> 00:30:08,204
that's like digging your own grave.

353
00:30:08,445 --> 00:30:11,200
You still don't seem 
to know what power means.

354
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:15,997
You're never going to beat 
Hong Gipyo at his game, this way.

355
00:30:16,591 --> 00:30:18,838
Did I make myself clear?

356
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:40,246
Are you ready?

357
00:30:41,197 --> 00:30:42,465
Yes.

358
00:30:42,869 --> 00:30:46,508
To test the machinery, 
I'll begin with a very simple question.

359
00:30:46,712 --> 00:30:48,843
Just answer yes or no.

360
00:30:49,053 --> 00:30:50,598
Did you have breakfast, this morning?

361
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,055
Yes.

362
00:30:54,771 --> 00:30:57,366
Then, let's get started.

363
00:30:57,643 --> 00:31:00,494
Is Lee Seongmo your name?

364
00:31:00,712 --> 00:31:02,203
Yes.

365
00:31:04,687 --> 00:31:06,022
<i>TRUTH / LIE</i>

366
00:31:06,131 --> 00:31:08,489
Do you think the 
northern puppets are our enemy?

367
00:31:08,573 --> 00:31:09,885
Yes.

368
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:14,060
Can you pledge allegiance
to your motherland?

369
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:16,051
Yes.

370
00:31:18,446 --> 00:31:21,694
<i>Can you stake your life
to protect our president?</i>

371
00:31:22,204 --> 00:31:23,090
Yes.

372
00:31:23,234 --> 00:31:27,716
Do you believe that remaining silent
when in difficulty is your best option?

373
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:29,613
Yes.

374
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:36,759
Your family must be somewhere, 
do you miss them?

375
00:31:37,733 --> 00:31:39,598
Yes.

376
00:31:41,597 --> 00:31:45,057
Are your parents still alive?

377
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:51,506
I'm in no position to
answer that with a yes or no.

378
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:54,166
A short answer will do.

379
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:58,207
I wish for them to still be alive.

380
00:32:00,638 --> 00:32:04,777
By any chance, 
do you remember your past?

381
00:32:19,048 --> 00:32:23,036
I'm asking you whether
you truly have amnesia.

382
00:32:24,959 --> 00:32:26,704
Are you suspecting me again?

383
00:32:26,858 --> 00:32:28,701
It's not my question.

384
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:32,503
These questions are based
upon your personal situation.

385
00:32:32,624 --> 00:32:34,251
Answer.

386
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:36,730
Remember the past?

387
00:32:44,106 --> 00:32:45,537
No.

388
00:32:56,318 --> 00:32:58,273
That's a lie.

389
00:33:05,062 --> 00:33:07,962
So you've been deceiving me all along?

390
00:33:09,971 --> 00:33:11,782
Speak!

391
00:33:11,956 --> 00:33:15,050
Why did you keep pretending 
you had amnesia?

392
00:33:20,438 --> 00:33:24,914
Because I had no power
to do anything about it.

393
00:33:25,076 --> 00:33:26,527
So?

394
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:34,607
Is there a purpose 
behind your approaching me?

395
00:33:38,157 --> 00:33:40,744
There is someone I want to kill.

396
00:33:42,775 --> 00:33:47,817
To avenge what he did to me, 
I needed power.

397
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,959
And who is this man?

398
00:33:59,305 --> 00:34:01,459
It's a long story.

399
00:34:01,763 --> 00:34:05,201
I'll tell you everything in detail, 
when the time comes.

400
00:34:07,186 --> 00:34:09,902
So you still can't believe me.

401
00:34:10,141 --> 00:34:12,213
I'm done with this.

402
00:34:12,369 --> 00:34:14,215
Wait.

403
00:34:20,611 --> 00:34:22,583
Let me ask you...

404
00:34:24,165 --> 00:34:27,047
the very last question,
and then you can go.

405
00:34:29,177 --> 00:34:30,669
Can you...

406
00:34:32,618 --> 00:34:35,277
stake your life for my sake?

407
00:34:38,307 --> 00:34:40,352
To protect mine,

408
00:34:41,713 --> 00:34:44,287
can you sacrifice your life?

409
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:48,991
The day you die...

410
00:34:49,425 --> 00:34:52,541
is the day Lee Seongmo will die as well.

411
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:13,052
That will be all.

412
00:35:14,712 --> 00:35:16,145
From now on,

413
00:35:16,578 --> 00:35:21,572
you're an elite agent of
KCIA's Inspection Department.

414
00:35:43,038 --> 00:35:45,047
Dammit...

415
00:35:45,516 --> 00:35:51,520
Do I even have to sell land 
to fill their bellies?

416
00:35:53,145 --> 00:35:55,732
Just go.

417
00:36:55,795 --> 00:37:04,148
I thought I'd never 
have to see him again...

418
00:37:13,641 --> 00:37:15,578
You can go.

419
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,291
It's me, open the door.

420
00:37:25,551 --> 00:37:27,609
<i>Chief Jo.</i>

421
00:37:35,629 --> 00:37:38,012
I came to meet you.

422
00:37:38,413 --> 00:37:40,575
I have no reason to meet you.

423
00:37:40,743 --> 00:37:42,849
It will only take a moment.

424
00:37:43,086 --> 00:37:46,152
Let's go somewhere quiet, 
and have a word.

425
00:37:46,281 --> 00:37:48,293
Somewhere quiet?!

426
00:37:48,955 --> 00:37:50,134
Just wait.

427
00:37:50,267 --> 00:37:53,949
I'll soon see you in the
KCIA's questioning room.

428
00:37:54,996 --> 00:38:01,590
I know everything you've done.

429
00:38:07,125 --> 00:38:09,231
Go in first.

430
00:38:09,652 --> 00:38:11,348
Yes.

431
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:24,304
You believe that kind of blackmail 
is going to work with me?

432
00:38:26,326 --> 00:38:30,320
When the little mutt you kept around 
starts showing its teeth,

433
00:38:30,429 --> 00:38:32,553
you can just get rid of it.

434
00:38:32,763 --> 00:38:34,760
Do it, then.

435
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:40,583
Still, it won't be as easy as you think.

436
00:38:41,015 --> 00:38:46,912
I'm not going to let you exploit me 
and then die like my friend.

437
00:38:47,882 --> 00:38:49,379
Fine.

438
00:38:50,028 --> 00:38:54,585
Let's move somewhere else, 
and finish talking.

439
00:39:12,703 --> 00:39:14,869
You've grown some guts, it seems?

440
00:39:16,272 --> 00:39:20,932
I learned this all from you.

441
00:39:22,516 --> 00:39:26,775
If you want to run a business,
you sure need guts.

442
00:39:32,258 --> 00:39:35,962
So you'll contribute funds
for our national development?

443
00:39:43,416 --> 00:39:50,697
In exchange, you'll have to grant us 
the government building construction.

444
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:52,598
You're already too late.

445
00:39:52,818 --> 00:39:58,048
There are people lining up outside to
throw crazy money at me for that contract.

446
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:03,192
How much will it take to convince you?

447
00:40:03,346 --> 00:40:07,999
If you believed in me from the start,
what you prepared would have been enough.

448
00:40:08,661 --> 00:40:12,480
But the situation has changed now.

449
00:40:13,484 --> 00:40:16,186
Get me double what you brought today.

450
00:40:17,678 --> 00:40:18,376
What?

451
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,138
If you want to upstage Hong Gipyo,

452
00:40:20,282 --> 00:40:23,880
you'll need to bring me
more than he did, if anything.

453
00:40:26,166 --> 00:40:28,789
Have we realized that
the more foolish the mistake,

454
00:40:28,898 --> 00:40:32,964
the costlier the repercussions will be?

455
00:40:37,899 --> 00:40:41,882
I will bring you the money you asked.

456
00:40:43,121 --> 00:40:48,115
Also, once you start giving me funds,
you'll have to continue doing so.

457
00:40:48,324 --> 00:40:51,825
From the presidential
down to the next general elections.

458
00:40:52,439 --> 00:40:54,160
Will you be able to?

459
00:41:00,242 --> 00:41:02,408
I will.

460
00:41:06,864 --> 00:41:08,689
<i>It's unfair...</i>

461
00:41:08,965 --> 00:41:13,718
So unfair, I can't take it anymore.

462
00:41:14,653 --> 00:41:20,348
I'll give them everything they ask.

463
00:41:21,311 --> 00:41:24,498
If it's money, I'll give it to them.

464
00:41:24,663 --> 00:41:28,020
And if they ask for my own blood,
that's what they'll get.

465
00:41:29,656 --> 00:41:31,148
Instead,

466
00:41:31,304 --> 00:41:38,641
even if those beasts force me 
to become worse than them,

467
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:43,851
I'll get back everything they
extorted from me, and more.

468
00:41:44,776 --> 00:41:46,799
If I can't do that,

469
00:41:47,292 --> 00:41:52,188
I'll never be at peace
with myself, even in death.

470
00:42:01,777 --> 00:42:04,490
<i>Listen, Yoon Seonsaeng!</i>

471
00:42:04,712 --> 00:42:07,020
Are you out of your mind?

472
00:42:07,161 --> 00:42:09,941
If he didn't come on time, 
just punish him with the lowest score.

473
00:42:10,121 --> 00:42:13,177
How could you let him
take the test separately?

474
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:17,207
Jo Minwoo's mother called, 
complaining to me.

475
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:21,971
If they learn of this, think of what
the PTA and board of education will say.

476
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,887
There was no dishonesty involved.

477
00:42:24,019 --> 00:42:27,617
If that's not dishonest, what is?

478
00:42:27,833 --> 00:42:32,762
Anyhow, fix Lee Gangmo's score 
back to zero.

479
00:42:32,876 --> 00:42:35,085
<i>He answered those questions 
in all fairness!</i>

480
00:42:35,217 --> 00:42:37,022
If you really need 
someone to blame for this,

481
00:42:37,203 --> 00:42:39,934
then I should be held responsible
for having him take that test separately.

482
00:42:41,739 --> 00:42:44,029
It's my fault, you did nothing wrong.

483
00:42:44,161 --> 00:42:45,918
It all happened because I was late.

484
00:42:46,026 --> 00:42:49,119
Fix his score, and update the ranking.

485
00:42:49,227 --> 00:42:52,279
Would you have done the same, 
if Jo Minwoo was involved?

486
00:42:52,377 --> 00:42:53,254
Say what?

487
00:42:53,371 --> 00:42:55,544
If Minwoo came late
and hadn't taken that test,

488
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,377
would you have given him a zero?

489
00:42:57,472 --> 00:42:59,160
Look, Yoon Seonsaeng!

490
00:42:59,267 --> 00:43:03,503
Gangmo is an orphan
with no siblings or parents.

491
00:43:03,714 --> 00:43:06,756
<i>Be honest and say 
that is the only reason!</i>

492
00:43:06,865 --> 00:43:08,112
Are you done?

493
00:43:08,196 --> 00:43:09,411
If that's not the case, then what?

494
00:43:09,532 --> 00:43:12,823
If that's not the case,
tell me what he did wrong!

495
00:43:12,956 --> 00:43:18,611
This is a sacred institution
whose goal is to treat everyone fairly!

496
00:43:18,731 --> 00:43:21,676
Why should Lee Gangmo
receive special treatment?

497
00:43:22,076 --> 00:43:25,444
It's because of
prejudiced teachers like you...

498
00:43:25,574 --> 00:43:29,066
that our country's education
has to live with a bad reputation.

499
00:43:29,259 --> 00:43:30,943
<i>Enough with the excuses.</i>

500
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:33,446
<i>We don't need teachers 
who have no conscience,</i>

501
00:43:33,566 --> 00:43:36,425
so hand me your 
resignation immediately!

502
00:43:36,526 --> 00:43:40,214
You stole the test questions from him!

503
00:43:45,081 --> 00:43:46,672
What did you just say?

504
00:43:46,785 --> 00:43:51,057
I saw you handing
Minwoo's mother the questions.

505
00:43:51,154 --> 00:43:53,903
You're the one 
without conscience, not him!

506
00:43:54,023 --> 00:43:56,177
You fool!

507
00:43:57,037 --> 00:44:01,592
Now he even starts
to lie through his teeth?!

508
00:44:02,121 --> 00:44:03,569
<i>Where is the detention officer?</i>

509
00:44:03,678 --> 00:44:07,446
The detention officer!
Where is he?

510
00:44:14,269 --> 00:44:15,520
Aigoo, my stomach...

511
00:44:15,664 --> 00:44:17,942
Listen, any broth left?

512
00:44:18,050 --> 00:44:21,912
Aigoo... Forget the broth.
Gangmo, that little...

513
00:44:22,213 --> 00:44:23,729
I ought to...

514
00:44:23,873 --> 00:44:25,630
What do I have to hear...

515
00:44:25,787 --> 00:44:29,108
Why, what did Gangmo do?

516
00:44:29,456 --> 00:44:33,537
He lashed out at his principal.

517
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:35,286
They called from school.

518
00:44:35,376 --> 00:44:37,451
He's been suspended for ten days.

519
00:44:37,583 --> 00:44:41,370
He's not the type to do that?!

520
00:44:41,491 --> 00:44:44,570
Think that someone raised on the 
streets would forget his nature?

521
00:44:45,448 --> 00:44:49,274
That's why they always tell you not
to keep beasts with dark hair around.

522
00:44:49,385 --> 00:44:51,128
What is this embarrassment?!

523
00:44:51,248 --> 00:44:53,835
Nice showing, really.

524
00:45:03,001 --> 00:45:06,851
Apologize to the principal right now.

525
00:45:07,007 --> 00:45:08,306
I did nothing wrong.

526
00:45:08,376 --> 00:45:09,534
What?

527
00:45:09,691 --> 00:45:12,027
I did nothing wrong,
why should I apologize?

528
00:45:12,171 --> 00:45:14,782
That... That little...

529
00:45:14,977 --> 00:45:17,317
Until he apologizes,

530
00:45:17,444 --> 00:45:18,845
keep punishing him.

531
00:45:18,943 --> 00:45:20,341
Yes.

532
00:45:23,024 --> 00:45:25,274
Stop hitting him!

533
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:31,463
Get out of my face.

534
00:45:31,855 --> 00:45:33,612
Come on in.

535
00:45:36,524 --> 00:45:37,392
Hey!

536
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:39,392
Gangmo.

537
00:45:46,927 --> 00:45:49,875
I'm his guardian.

538
00:45:49,971 --> 00:45:53,385
Ahh... Is that so?

539
00:45:53,806 --> 00:45:55,936
Time to get up.

540
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:03,693
<i>I've heard a lot about you.</i>

541
00:46:03,817 --> 00:46:06,286
So you're raising an orphan?

542
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:10,558
Yes, I'm the only one 
to blame for all this.

543
00:46:10,636 --> 00:46:12,431
I apologize, Mister Principal.

544
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:18,092
It's a shame we had to meet for this.

545
00:46:19,428 --> 00:46:25,613
I'll take him home for today,
and will visit you again later.

546
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:28,006
Yes, go ahead.

547
00:46:28,777 --> 00:46:33,343
During one's childhood,
anyone can make mistakes.

548
00:46:33,536 --> 00:46:36,941
<i>Take this opportunity
to reflect on your actions,</i>

549
00:46:37,062 --> 00:46:40,418
and return to us a better person.

550
00:46:43,222 --> 00:46:44,730
What are you waiting for?

551
00:46:44,923 --> 00:46:47,565
Apologize and let's go.

552
00:46:50,046 --> 00:46:54,296
Do it!
We need to go home.

553
00:46:54,505 --> 00:46:56,811
I did nothing wrong.

554
00:46:58,808 --> 00:47:01,446
You gave the test to Minwoo's mother!

555
00:47:01,554 --> 00:47:03,224
<i>Minwoo is the one 
who committed dishonesty.</i>

556
00:47:03,356 --> 00:47:06,970
He's the one who
should be suspended, not me!

557
00:47:07,997 --> 00:47:10,478
Gangmo!

558
00:47:16,002 --> 00:47:17,699
I apologize.

559
00:47:17,888 --> 00:47:21,152
Please, try to understand.

560
00:47:25,765 --> 00:47:27,927
Gangmo!

561
00:47:33,282 --> 00:47:35,929
Where is your resignation?

562
00:47:36,130 --> 00:47:38,703
I must have told you to quit already?!

563
00:47:38,875 --> 00:47:42,866
I have no intention of teaching
at this school any longer, myself.

564
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:43,792
What?

565
00:47:43,893 --> 00:47:46,186
I believe what Gangmo said.

566
00:47:47,514 --> 00:47:49,331
And that's...

567
00:47:49,622 --> 00:47:52,696
because you're 
more than capable of that.

568
00:47:53,675 --> 00:47:56,041
Listen to him!

569
00:47:56,558 --> 00:47:57,703
<i>Gangmo!</i>

570
00:47:57,798 --> 00:47:58,532
<i>Gangmo.</i>

571
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:01,425
You fool! Stop there.

572
00:48:01,942 --> 00:48:05,063
Aigoo, you'll kill me...

573
00:48:05,528 --> 00:48:07,934
I'm going to quit school.

574
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:10,641
Shining shoes is better.

575
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:14,526
It's too unfair and cowardly
for me to endure all this.

576
00:48:15,729 --> 00:48:21,902
You fool, think you're
the only one facing unfairness?

577
00:48:23,971 --> 00:48:28,174
This world has always been dirty.

578
00:48:28,318 --> 00:48:30,845
<i>Just think of it as mud springs.</i>

579
00:48:31,037 --> 00:48:35,537
If you give up what you were doing 
just because a little mud is on you,

580
00:48:35,778 --> 00:48:38,935
who would ever succeed in life?

581
00:48:40,401 --> 00:48:44,140
You learned something precious today.

582
00:48:44,384 --> 00:48:48,785
What will learning 
a few more English words matter?

583
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,298
You need to learn about life.

584
00:48:52,509 --> 00:48:54,404
<i>In exchange for a little suspension,</i>

585
00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:57,854
just think of it as having learned 
a much more precious lesson.

586
00:48:57,954 --> 00:48:59,797
That'll do.

587
00:49:03,827 --> 00:49:05,552
You fool...

588
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:07,578
Where are you going again?

589
00:49:07,705 --> 00:49:09,434
Gangmo!

590
00:49:26,671 --> 00:49:30,122
Can someone who's been suspended 
even enter this class?

591
00:49:30,228 --> 00:49:32,299
Confess the truth yourself.

592
00:49:32,491 --> 00:49:33,177
What?

593
00:49:33,274 --> 00:49:36,782
You know better than anyone
that you didn't earn that top spot.

594
00:49:36,879 --> 00:49:41,787
Enough with the excuses, 
just be a man and acknowledge defeat.

595
00:49:45,373 --> 00:49:47,876
You dirty coward.

596
00:49:56,536 --> 00:49:58,155
<i>Gangmo!</i>

597
00:49:59,633 --> 00:50:01,563
Your bag.

598
00:50:28,603 --> 00:50:32,369
Now the damned commies 
even invaded colleges...

599
00:50:32,513 --> 00:50:35,569
What is happening to this country?!

600
00:50:40,981 --> 00:50:43,522
Congressman, you have a guest.

601
00:50:43,678 --> 00:50:45,375
Who?

602
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:51,882
What's this?

603
00:50:51,979 --> 00:50:53,491
A liquor called Igangju.

604
00:50:53,603 --> 00:50:56,398
Liquor?!
Nice...

605
00:51:01,633 --> 00:51:04,653
Chief Jo.
What do you think you're doing?

606
00:51:04,929 --> 00:51:09,011
Hong Gipyo of Daeryuk
Construction sent me that.

607
00:51:09,188 --> 00:51:10,345
What? Hong Gipyo?!

608
00:51:10,435 --> 00:51:11,943
And it wasn't just to me.

609
00:51:12,124 --> 00:51:13,736
Be it the KCIA or the Blue House,

610
00:51:13,856 --> 00:51:18,029
this fella is throwing money at everyone, 
lobbying left and right.

611
00:51:18,332 --> 00:51:20,839
The elections are right behind the corner.

612
00:51:21,102 --> 00:51:23,905
The opposition is trying its damnedest to
find the tiniest blemish about the government,

613
00:51:24,014 --> 00:51:25,650
and Hong Gipyo goes around 
throwing bribes at us?

614
00:51:25,819 --> 00:51:30,013
A few journalists have started
getting suspicious already.

615
00:51:30,198 --> 00:51:31,714
What?!

616
00:51:32,545 --> 00:51:36,491
If they learn of our
connection with Director Hong,

617
00:51:36,596 --> 00:51:40,481
it will cause our downfall 
at the presidential elections.

618
00:51:40,830 --> 00:51:44,673
What is the KCIA doing,
letting people like him run free?

619
00:51:44,801 --> 00:51:48,404
Even after seeing this money, 
you don't understand?

620
00:51:48,564 --> 00:51:49,995
Aigoo...

621
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:54,195
This country is rotting
inside out, we're doomed.

622
00:51:54,460 --> 00:52:00,367
By any chance, did you receive 
any bribes from Director Hong?

623
00:52:00,729 --> 00:52:01,883
Look.

624
00:52:02,052 --> 00:52:03,785
What do you take me for?

625
00:52:04,001 --> 00:52:06,781
Unless it's devoted to our
country, I accept nothing!

626
00:52:06,874 --> 00:52:10,745
Then, give back the money
Director Hong donated.

627
00:52:11,570 --> 00:52:14,096
During election season? It's like 
water dripping out of a bucket's hole.

628
00:52:14,216 --> 00:52:15,720
Think I still have it?

629
00:52:15,852 --> 00:52:21,504
Thankfully, I know someone willing to 
donate to the national development fund.

630
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:24,849
Is he trustworthy?

631
00:52:25,045 --> 00:52:26,435
He's clean.

632
00:52:26,585 --> 00:52:30,262
He won't create any problems.

633
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:32,596
And who is that?

634
00:52:33,005 --> 00:52:34,545
Come on in.

635
00:52:40,585 --> 00:52:42,581
Introduce yourself.

636
00:53:01,416 --> 00:53:04,977
I'm Manbo Construction's 
Hwang Taeseop.

637
00:53:05,543 --> 00:53:09,176
The commies took 
away my land back home,

638
00:53:09,386 --> 00:53:11,824
and I only now 
was able to settle down.

639
00:53:12,023 --> 00:53:15,963
As meager as my means might be,

640
00:53:16,251 --> 00:53:20,715
allow me to sacrifice myself
for the betterment of our country.

641
00:53:25,687 --> 00:53:27,138
So...

642
00:53:27,475 --> 00:53:32,504
How much can you donate to
the national development fund?

643
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:43,698
Shoe shine.

644
00:53:44,444 --> 00:53:46,586
Shoe shine.

645
00:53:47,531 --> 00:53:49,459
Ajeosshi, can I shine your shoes?

646
00:53:49,606 --> 00:53:51,014
Your shoes.

647
00:53:51,170 --> 00:53:52,518
I'm fine.

648
00:53:52,611 --> 00:53:54,696
It's all right.

649
00:53:55,021 --> 00:53:57,198
I'll shine them next time.

650
00:54:22,336 --> 00:54:23,575
<i>Hwang Jeongyeon.</i>

651
00:54:23,737 --> 00:54:28,069
I think I'll have to
take you to the movies.

652
00:54:38,947 --> 00:54:41,973
You bastard.

653
00:54:43,001 --> 00:54:45,619
You brat...

654
00:54:54,845 --> 00:54:58,767
Didn't I tell you 
not to get any illusions?

655
00:54:58,924 --> 00:55:03,291
Think school would suit people like us?

656
00:55:10,245 --> 00:55:11,857
<i>I'll give you this chocolate,</i>

657
00:55:12,026 --> 00:55:14,095
<i>so just forget it.</i>

658
00:55:30,236 --> 00:55:33,147
I'll be right back.

659
00:55:35,818 --> 00:55:37,428
Come with me.

660
00:55:37,617 --> 00:55:40,450
I told the director
I wouldn't go back there.

661
00:55:40,727 --> 00:55:42,893
Who told you to come home?

662
00:55:48,798 --> 00:55:50,217
<i>Why don't you keep your promises?</i>

663
00:55:50,326 --> 00:55:54,248
I didn't even know you were here, 
and waited for ages outside the theater.

664
00:55:57,629 --> 00:56:01,390
Do you know why I like you?

665
00:56:03,316 --> 00:56:06,143
Because you never lie to me.

666
00:56:07,322 --> 00:56:10,439
Whatever everyone says, I trust you.

667
00:56:10,690 --> 00:56:14,470
You ended first, for real.

668
00:57:40,681 --> 00:57:42,185
Aim the barrel right on target,

669
00:57:42,294 --> 00:57:45,133
and hold the gun with both hands, 
making it stable.

670
00:57:46,276 --> 00:57:49,964
You said you had to avenge someone?

671
00:57:50,846 --> 00:57:54,784
<i>Imagine the center of that target
is your enemy's heart.</i>

672
00:57:55,033 --> 00:57:57,705
Technique is not all it takes
to be a proper shooter.

673
00:57:57,848 --> 00:57:59,593
Your frame of mind is just as important.

674
00:57:59,786 --> 00:58:02,789
Here, try again.

675
00:58:03,305 --> 00:58:06,567
Your enemy is right there.

676
00:58:06,661 --> 00:58:08,720
Aim for his heart.

677
00:58:31,166 --> 00:58:34,523
We'll eat dinner and then go home.

678
00:58:35,149 --> 00:58:36,665
Go by yourself.

679
00:58:36,797 --> 00:58:38,843
I don't want to go home.

680
00:58:38,999 --> 00:58:41,755
Will you keep being stubborn?

681
00:59:21,381 --> 00:59:22,819
Jeongyeon!

682
00:59:23,736 --> 00:59:25,768
Gangmo!

683
01:00:45,930 --> 01:00:47,988
<i>This way!</i>

684
01:01:23,421 --> 01:01:24,371
You can go home.

685
01:01:24,528 --> 01:01:27,006
<i>{\a6}*lit. lady, but in this case a servile
deferential for "young lady of the house"</i>

686
01:01:24,528 --> 01:01:27,006
Agasshi*.

687
01:01:29,629 --> 01:01:32,939
I told you not to 
call me that, didn't I?

688
01:01:33,031 --> 01:01:35,934
I need to bring you there, 
don't you know?

689
01:01:36,115 --> 01:01:37,841
I'm not going there.

690
01:01:37,985 --> 01:01:40,042
Why would I?

691
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:44,747
If I don't take you there,
the chairman will beat me to a pulp.

692
01:01:45,024 --> 01:01:47,250
Gangmo! Let me go!

693
01:01:47,406 --> 01:01:50,035
Hey! You blockhead!

694
01:01:50,316 --> 01:01:54,200
<i>~ Manbo Construction 10th Anniversary ~</i>

695
01:02:26,611 --> 01:02:28,704
Thank you for coming, 
Commissioner Han.

696
01:02:28,864 --> 01:02:31,847
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

697
01:02:33,603 --> 01:02:35,372
By the way...

698
01:02:36,478 --> 01:02:40,064
I wonder if Minwoo 
is doing well at work.

699
01:02:40,211 --> 01:02:42,206
What are you saying?

700
01:02:42,314 --> 01:02:47,568
I can only be thankful someone
like Minwoo is part of our company.

701
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:54,258
What is your son's 
position in the company?

702
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:56,702
His?!

703
01:02:58,231 --> 01:03:03,500
Jeongshik... will soon inherit
the company from his father.

704
01:03:03,692 --> 01:03:05,329
Ahh...

705
01:03:05,509 --> 01:03:08,182
Must be preparing to become the heir?

706
01:03:08,288 --> 01:03:11,737
Well... I guess you could say that?!

707
01:03:21,507 --> 01:03:26,309
I still don't see any chairmen 
from the construction committee here?

708
01:03:26,622 --> 01:03:29,089
I hear the chairman 
invited them firsthand.

709
01:03:29,317 --> 01:03:32,246
Even if late, they'll soon join us.

710
01:03:32,999 --> 01:03:36,284
At this bidding for 
the subway construction,

711
01:03:36,585 --> 01:03:40,282
I hear that only construction 
committee members will be allowed to bid.

712
01:03:40,895 --> 01:03:43,727
If Manbo Construction
is to win that bidding,

713
01:03:43,842 --> 01:03:48,440
we need to make sure it's
accepted into the committee.

714
01:03:50,275 --> 01:03:54,017
There is something I need to ask you.

715
01:03:54,762 --> 01:03:56,604
Not content with watching their back,

716
01:03:56,748 --> 01:04:03,679
why did you push me to join
Manbo Construction, despite my reserves?

717
01:04:04,450 --> 01:04:09,370
Is a weak spot the reason behind all this?

718
01:04:10,585 --> 01:04:12,437
Weak spot?

719
01:04:12,655 --> 01:04:14,724
Who, me?

720
01:04:15,386 --> 01:04:19,075
You still don't understand
how the world goes round.

721
01:04:19,363 --> 01:04:21,578
Stop wasting time with that,

722
01:04:21,831 --> 01:04:26,559
and worry about winning the bidding 
for that subway construction.

723
01:04:29,303 --> 01:04:30,788
The party has started.

724
01:04:30,959 --> 01:04:32,811
Wear this.

725
01:04:33,065 --> 01:04:35,494
Ahh... Forgot the shoes.

726
01:04:35,724 --> 01:04:37,372
I'll be right back.

727
01:04:38,010 --> 01:04:39,795
Do I really need to wear a dress?

728
01:04:39,894 --> 01:04:43,648
While you're here, 
make your father happy for once.

729
01:04:43,906 --> 01:04:48,077
You know how hard he's worked 
to protect his company.

730
01:04:48,376 --> 01:04:50,484
You people will drive me crazy...

731
01:05:08,261 --> 01:05:10,006
<i>Anyone out there?</i>

732
01:05:15,329 --> 01:05:17,303

735
01:05:28,062 --> 01:05:30,118
<i>Gangmo!</i>

<i>Gangmo.</i>

738
01:05:46,706 --> 01:05:50,230
<i>Gangmo... Help me with this.</i>

739
01:05:57,251 --> 01:06:01,992
Being the chairman's daughter 
is really hard.

740
01:06:03,309 --> 01:06:05,310
I look awkward, right?

741
01:06:05,541 --> 01:06:07,091
How d...

742
01:06:09,088 --> 01:06:11,867
- Who are you?
- It's me... I'm not a molester!

743

- Gangmo!!

Gangmo!

Who are you?

746
01:06:21,353 --> 01:06:22,867
Who?

747
01:06:26,009 --> 01:06:27,532
Long time no see.

748
01:06:31,086 --> 01:06:32,822
I'm Minwoo.
