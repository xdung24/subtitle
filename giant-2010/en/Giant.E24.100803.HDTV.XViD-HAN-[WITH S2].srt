5
00:00:17,615 --> 00:00:21,851
Don't tell me,
they send us to bed on time?!

6
00:00:22,617 --> 00:00:25,359
<i>Hey... No. 534.</i>

7
00:00:25,551 --> 00:00:28,715
So I hear you went to the
commander's barracks today?

8
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:30,810
What did you do there?

9
00:00:31,013 --> 00:00:35,421
<i>Don't tell me they let
us sleep because of you?</i>

10
00:00:36,692 --> 00:00:39,803
Ahh... really. Did they
spike your drink with cement?

11
00:00:39,897 --> 00:00:42,132
Is that damned trap
going to be stuck all night...

12
00:00:46,586 --> 00:00:48,341
<i>What did you just say?</i>

13
00:00:48,547 --> 00:00:50,181
Accept my conditions.

14
00:00:50,269 --> 00:00:51,267
Go ahead.

15
00:00:51,422 --> 00:00:56,422
Allow enough sleep and nourishment to
everyone who participates in the works.

16
00:00:56,544 --> 00:00:57,248
And?

17
00:00:57,331 --> 00:00:59,588
Many people got injured.

18
00:00:59,897 --> 00:01:03,699
Allow them to be hospitalized
until they fully recover.

19
00:01:03,841 --> 00:01:05,566
And should you fail to finish on time?

20
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:09,680
If you want me to stake
my life on this, I will.

21
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:14,571
So let's hear it. How can you make
concrete dry out in two days?

22
00:01:24,377 --> 00:01:27,264
Aigoo... Good girl.

23
00:01:27,394 --> 00:01:28,866
You need to eat to survive.

24
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,596
How can you live without food?

25
00:01:30,696 --> 00:01:33,751
Here... Say "Ahhh."

26
00:01:35,285 --> 00:01:38,327
We brought you some more
side dishes and fruits here,

27
00:01:38,446 --> 00:01:41,070
so don't skip meals and help yourself.

28
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:43,673
Ma'am.

29
00:01:43,906 --> 00:01:45,859
Aigoo... You're here, Ma'am.

30
00:01:45,966 --> 00:01:47,963
What are you all doing here?

31
00:01:48,165 --> 00:01:52,407
The chairman told us
to take care of her, so...

32
00:01:52,514 --> 00:01:53,928
Leave us alone.

33
00:01:54,082 --> 00:01:56,957
- I...
- Now.

34
00:01:57,124 --> 00:01:59,590
Yes, we'll be going.

35
00:01:59,797 --> 00:02:01,104
Hurry up and come.

36
00:02:01,175 --> 00:02:04,429
- But I need to finish feeding her.
- Hurry up and come!

37
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:08,005
Finish it all, okay?

38
00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:22,591
So you can hear now?

39
00:02:24,059 --> 00:02:26,621
There soon will be
a shareholders' meeting.

40
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:31,483
And on that day,
Jeongshik will be proclaimed heir.

41
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:38,160
<i>You're mute now, so you won't
be able to work anymore.</i>

42
00:02:39,741 --> 00:02:41,824
About your stocks.

43
00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:44,426
Transfer them to me.

44
00:02:45,067 --> 00:02:49,796
<i>Who do you think will take care of you,
when Jeongshik inherits the company?</i>

45
00:02:49,986 --> 00:02:53,051
I'll give you enough to live in
luxury for the rest of your days,

46
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:55,324
so move abroad.

47
00:02:57,308 --> 00:03:01,395
Did I make myself clear?

48
00:03:05,779 --> 00:03:07,762
You wench, I ought to...

49
00:03:08,808 --> 00:03:09,568
Let me go.

50
00:03:09,663 --> 00:03:11,504
<i>Will you let me go or not?</i>

51
00:03:14,724 --> 00:03:15,909
Sure...

52
00:03:16,114 --> 00:03:18,283
<i>So you're going to act like that?</i>

53
00:03:18,455 --> 00:03:20,801
Just wait until the
shareholders' meeting is over,

54
00:03:20,968 --> 00:03:24,485
so you can find out
what kind of misery awaits you!

55
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:27,799
<i>What is this?!</i>

56
00:03:27,906 --> 00:03:29,225
<i>Know how much this cost...</i>

57
00:03:29,308 --> 00:03:31,831
I'll be damned, really!

58
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:37,847
They're really crossing the line here.

59
00:03:47,257 --> 00:03:48,704
<i>Shideok.</i>

60
00:03:55,004 --> 00:03:56,859
A...Agasshi...

61
00:03:59,136 --> 00:04:01,806
You... You can speak?

62
00:04:05,165 --> 00:04:07,625
I need your help.

63
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:23,103
<i>We just asked Minwoo's father.</i>

64
00:04:23,198 --> 00:04:25,645
<i>To send Gangmo to the Samcheong camp.</i>

65
00:04:25,859 --> 00:04:28,550
Think it was an accident
that killed him?

66
00:04:28,836 --> 00:04:32,175
Minwoo's father paid someone
off to get rid of him.

67
00:04:32,329 --> 00:04:38,602
So... Minwoo's father killed Gangmo
on Minwoo's and your behalf?

68
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:40,439
Yeah!

69
00:04:43,517 --> 00:04:45,489
You just wait.

70
00:04:46,677 --> 00:04:49,208
You'll never take
the company away from me.

71
00:04:50,705 --> 00:04:57,596
I will avenge Gangmo and
make you pay for killing him.

72
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:02,741
Agasshi.

73
00:05:02,859 --> 00:05:05,449
Here's the company shares
controlled by the board of directors.

74
00:05:07,951 --> 00:05:11,059
It was really hard to find this out.

75
00:05:15,138 --> 00:05:16,303
Thanks, Shideok.

76
00:05:16,422 --> 00:05:18,219
No need to thank me.

77
00:05:18,548 --> 00:05:23,615
I wanted to get revenge against
those who killed Gangmo myself.

78
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,817
<i>Jeongshik and his mother hold
about 20 percent of the shares,</i>

79
00:05:28,081 --> 00:05:30,917
<i>and it seems like they won over a good
number of minor shareholders as well.</i>

80
00:05:31,217 --> 00:05:35,955
Even if the chairman takes your side,
it won't be easy to turn the tide.

81
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,603
<i>{\a6}- Yoo Gyeongok -</i>

82
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,603
<i>Who is this?</i>

83
00:05:38,675 --> 00:05:41,039
<i>She controls quite the amount?!</i>

84
00:05:41,526 --> 00:05:43,178
Ahh... This lady.

85
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,376
She's the owner of the Royal Club.

86
00:05:46,255 --> 00:05:48,538
Do you want to give it
a try and convince her?

87
00:05:48,732 --> 00:05:50,226
We must.

88
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,497
Also, Shideok.

89
00:05:52,712 --> 00:05:57,951
You must never tell anyone
I've recovered until the meeting.

90
00:05:58,545 --> 00:06:00,347
Don't you worry.

91
00:06:00,912 --> 00:06:03,823
Gather all the calcium
chloride you have here.

92
00:06:03,977 --> 00:06:05,035
Calcium chloride?!

93
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:09,668
If you add it to the cement,
it will dry out much faster.

94
00:06:09,787 --> 00:06:13,774
Call unit command and tell them to bring
here all the calcium chloride we have.

95
00:06:13,881 --> 00:06:15,858
- Quick!
- Yes, Sir.

96
00:06:18,004 --> 00:06:20,154
This is Owl.
Eagle, do you copy?

97
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:22,970
<i>Repeat, this is Owl.
Eagle, do you copy?</i>

98
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:27,689
Did it snow somewhere?

99
00:06:27,772 --> 00:06:32,191
Why bring so much calcium chloride,
when they only use it to melt snow?

100
00:06:32,334 --> 00:06:34,438
Aigoo... So heavy...

101
00:06:34,529 --> 00:06:35,376
Here.

102
00:06:35,482 --> 00:06:38,239
Aigoo... Did you buy me
sacks of tonic, or something?

103
00:06:38,346 --> 00:06:40,226
- Next!
- Wretched fool...

104
00:06:40,309 --> 00:06:44,099
Look at the sky.
There'll be showers in no time.

105
00:06:46,927 --> 00:06:52,860
If it starts raining, even Santa
Calcium won't do squat, you fool.

106
00:07:00,999 --> 00:07:02,640
You stay out of this.

107
00:07:03,982 --> 00:07:06,350
I'll tell the drill instructor,
so step aside!

108
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:08,447
Want to see me get beaten to a pulp?

109
00:07:08,533 --> 00:07:09,577
Hey, Park Sotae...

110
00:07:09,684 --> 00:07:13,955
Spare me the cheap compassion,
and hand me a sack.

111
00:07:31,237 --> 00:07:32,117
It's raining!

112
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,362
Hurry up and cover the cement!

113
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:57,448
<i>- Gangnam Candidate Jo Pilyeon in Election Scandal -
Climactic Reversal of Fortune Expected</i>

114
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:04,367
Your approval rate is freefalling.

115
00:08:04,672 --> 00:08:06,918
The supporters' association
is up in arms as well.

116
00:08:07,036 --> 00:08:10,256
They threaten to
immediately halt all funding.

117
00:08:11,302 --> 00:08:14,134
Haven't you found that informer yet?

118
00:08:14,307 --> 00:08:16,961
- If we could only find him...
- Minwoo.

119
00:08:17,242 --> 00:08:20,775
The second most important
thing for me after breathing...

120
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:22,483
is winning.

121
00:08:22,985 --> 00:08:24,240
Excuse me?

122
00:08:24,612 --> 00:08:25,919
Watch and learn.

123
00:08:26,062 --> 00:08:29,561
How your father will
turn this sinking ship around.

124
00:08:29,793 --> 00:08:36,207
It'll be the perfect opportunity to
learn how to deal with your opponents.

125
00:08:40,282 --> 00:08:42,004
I'm back.

126
00:08:51,057 --> 00:08:52,996
<i>He's the boss of the Maljukgeori gang.</i>

127
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,809
<i>He started working under
Min Honggi for these elections.</i>

128
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:58,251
He will more than suffice.

129
00:08:58,577 --> 00:09:00,798
Proceed with our plan.

130
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,450
All right.

131
00:09:06,156 --> 00:09:10,386
By now, Min Honggi
must be feeling elated.

132
00:09:10,814 --> 00:09:12,421
That's not too bad
a proposition, either.

133
00:09:12,599 --> 00:09:19,217
Because it's exactly when you let
your guard down that you risk the most.

134
00:09:21,082 --> 00:09:22,650
Thanks, Seongmo.

135
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:27,548
Your help was truly crucial in
deciding the fate of these elections.

136
00:09:30,555 --> 00:09:34,190
But how did it go with the
favor I asked you last time?

137
00:09:34,321 --> 00:09:37,671
Right... He should have
been here by now already?!

138
00:09:39,898 --> 00:09:41,799
Looks like he just arrived.

139
00:09:41,977 --> 00:09:44,297
- You have a guest.
- Yeah, I know. Let him in.

140
00:09:44,484 --> 00:09:45,898
Sir.

141
00:09:47,703 --> 00:09:49,000
Come on in, Colonel Kim.

142
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,769
- It's been a long time, Seonbaenim.
- Right.

143
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:53,539
Let me introduce him.

144
00:09:53,669 --> 00:09:57,852
This is my most trusted colleague
from my KCIA days, Lee Seongmo.

145
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:00,750
This is Colonel Kim Sutak
from the National Security Guard.

146
00:10:01,261 --> 00:10:02,506
Nice to meet you.

147
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:05,161
I've heard a lot about you.

148
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:10,266
I wish I could stay here with you,
but sadly I have a previous engagement.

149
00:10:10,686 --> 00:10:14,963
Seongmo, this buddy here,
means a lot to me.

150
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:18,515
Whatever favor he might ask,
help him out for my sake.

151
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,214
Certainly, Seonbaenim.

152
00:10:20,381 --> 00:10:22,912
Right.
So, I'll let you discuss.

153
00:10:23,101 --> 00:10:25,031
See you again.

154
00:10:26,407 --> 00:10:28,127
<i>I'm back.</i>

155
00:10:28,531 --> 00:10:30,253
So, how did it go?

156
00:10:30,408 --> 00:10:33,346
Think it will all dry out before
the division commander arrives?

157
00:10:35,258 --> 00:10:36,982
You little...

158
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:39,335
You were so sure
you could do it in two days,

159
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:41,318
so what's with the hesitation now?

160
00:10:41,472 --> 00:10:46,747
I never imagined it could start raining.

161
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,896
Don't even think of using that
as an excuse to save your behind.

162
00:10:50,169 --> 00:10:51,856
If it doesn't dry out by tomorrow,

163
00:10:51,987 --> 00:10:54,626
I might be going to detention camp,
but first I'll be dealing with you.

164
00:10:54,722 --> 00:10:56,301
Is that clear?

165
00:11:08,725 --> 00:11:10,578
Hey... Listen.

166
00:11:10,674 --> 00:11:16,197
Did you give them any condition
in exchange for doing this?

167
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,241
<i>Early release?</i>

168
00:11:18,757 --> 00:11:22,874
But with today's showers,

169
00:11:22,993 --> 00:11:27,079
there's no way in hell
it'll dry out by tomorrow?!

170
00:11:28,398 --> 00:11:31,130
Just pray and hope it will work.

171
00:11:31,297 --> 00:11:34,742
Pray for sunshine.

172
00:11:35,004 --> 00:11:38,237
Who knows what could happen?

173
00:11:40,091 --> 00:11:42,811
If we get a sunny day,
is there a good chance it'll dry out?

174
00:11:42,942 --> 00:11:47,065
Aigoo... And how am I
supposed to know that?

175
00:11:57,572 --> 00:11:59,592
Everyone, wake up!

176
00:12:01,825 --> 00:12:04,018
Gather outside immediately.

177
00:12:04,213 --> 00:12:07,002
Get moving, you pricks!

178
00:12:09,838 --> 00:12:10,978
How do you think it went?

179
00:12:11,085 --> 00:12:12,297
Looks like a really nice day?

180
00:12:12,442 --> 00:12:18,223
You sure are funny. Why ask me
when you can go find out by yourself?

181
00:12:51,994 --> 00:12:53,959
Ten... Hut!

182
00:12:54,102 --> 00:12:56,112
<i>Salute our division commander.</i>

183
00:12:56,288 --> 00:12:58,497
Red hunt!

184
00:13:14,204 --> 00:13:17,955
Starting now, everyone will
go straight to the army bathhouse.

185
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:19,978
<i>After that,</i>

186
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:27,309
you have the day off.

187
00:13:28,961 --> 00:13:31,848
Drink and have fun all you want.

188
00:14:02,894 --> 00:14:07,502
Ahh... You twerps.
Never taken a goddamned bath before?

189
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:10,679
It's so damned noisy I
can't concentrate, you fools.

190
00:14:15,117 --> 00:14:17,351
What's this smell?

191
00:14:18,372 --> 00:14:23,350
I'll just let them cut it off
and live as a cripple.

192
00:14:23,505 --> 00:14:24,965
Hey.

193
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:26,641
Hold him.

194
00:14:26,748 --> 00:14:28,815
What are you trying to do?
I'm taking no baths.

195
00:14:28,887 --> 00:14:30,312
Now!

196
00:14:31,373 --> 00:14:33,763
I said I'm not going to.

197
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:37,166
What... What are you doing?
I said leave me alone.

198
00:14:37,384 --> 00:14:38,913
Aww... The smell.

199
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:40,390
Take off his clothes.

200
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:43,515
- No...
- Just... Stay put, will you!

201
00:14:43,669 --> 00:14:46,087
I said no...

202
00:14:46,233 --> 00:14:48,027
The hell is that?

203
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:49,871
What's that, a skin disease?

204
00:14:58,442 --> 00:15:01,024
I told you I won't bathe, didn't I?

205
00:15:01,329 --> 00:15:02,470
Hey!

206
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:04,453
Carry him.

207
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,764
<i>Aww... That smell...</i>

208
00:15:30,865 --> 00:15:36,593
When we're done bathing,
you'll be transferred to the infirmary.

209
00:15:37,662 --> 00:15:39,953
I told them.

210
00:15:41,391 --> 00:15:43,470
<i>To fix your leg.</i>

211
00:15:43,632 --> 00:15:45,561
Let me go!

212
00:15:46,309 --> 00:15:50,422
Have I ever... Have I
ever asked you to help me?

213
00:15:50,517 --> 00:15:52,309
Uh?

214
00:15:54,734 --> 00:15:57,930
You've been indicted
for murder because of me.

215
00:15:58,322 --> 00:16:02,515
I even let money blind me
and tried to kill you!

216
00:16:02,789 --> 00:16:05,177
I'm that kind of man.

217
00:16:05,498 --> 00:16:07,430
Just human trash.

218
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:12,158
But why are you
acting like this with me?

219
00:16:12,824 --> 00:16:17,113
Just beat me to a pulp instead.

220
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,900
Kill me with your own hands, you fool!

221
00:16:26,889 --> 00:16:30,952
Even if you die, don't do it here.

222
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:36,185
Go die outside,
if that's what you want.

223
00:16:37,646 --> 00:16:40,117
Dying while confined...

224
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,660
and doing it outside in all freedom...

225
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:45,214
are a whole different story.

226
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:51,340
We're already struggling as it is,

227
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:55,046
so we should at least be
entitled to a peaceful death.

228
00:16:57,645 --> 00:16:59,905
Gan...Gangmo...

229
00:17:00,448 --> 00:17:02,421
You really...

230
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,165
I what?

231
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:08,230
What, you fool?

232
00:17:10,965 --> 00:17:13,193
I'm sorry.

233
00:17:13,424 --> 00:17:14,981
I'm really sorry.

234
00:17:15,266 --> 00:17:16,775
Gangmo...

235
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,996
I'm sorry.

236
00:17:19,472 --> 00:17:21,598
Forgive me.

237
00:17:21,824 --> 00:17:28,145
Forgive this scumbag
just this once, Gangmo.

238
00:17:28,753 --> 00:17:32,816
I'm sorry, Gangmo...

239
00:17:33,137 --> 00:17:35,691
I'm sorry...

240
00:17:36,178 --> 00:17:41,787
I... I'm sorry, Gangmo!

241
00:17:42,131 --> 00:17:45,161
I'm sorry...

242
00:17:46,254 --> 00:17:48,274
Gangmo...

243
00:17:49,141 --> 00:17:54,306
I... I'm sorry...

244
00:18:15,904 --> 00:18:17,709
<i>Gangmo.</i>

245
00:18:18,446 --> 00:18:23,377
When my leg recovers...

246
00:18:24,066 --> 00:18:25,622
No.

247
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:30,270
Even if they cut off both my legs,

248
00:18:31,042 --> 00:18:33,383
and I have to creep my way around,

249
00:18:34,832 --> 00:18:37,268
I'll come back to you.

250
00:18:39,002 --> 00:18:42,383
<i>Even if you refuse to accept me,</i>

251
00:18:42,834 --> 00:18:51,234
or if I die and have to
follow you around as a ghost,

252
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:54,987
I'll remain by your side.

253
00:19:45,977 --> 00:19:49,257
You sure are something.

254
00:19:49,513 --> 00:19:54,592
So, what, did you stake
your life just to get this?

255
00:19:55,419 --> 00:20:00,554
Did you by any chance learn of
some terminal disease or something?

256
00:20:00,764 --> 00:20:03,063
You take your life that lightly?

257
00:20:03,253 --> 00:20:05,475
Can't see how happy everyone is?

258
00:20:05,606 --> 00:20:08,588
- That's good enough.
- I'll be damned.

259
00:20:09,776 --> 00:20:13,894
If you start acting like that,
what does that make of me?

260
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,461
You're cursing at me
deep down, aren't you?

261
00:20:16,532 --> 00:20:19,621
"You sorry ass twat," and stuff.

262
00:20:20,073 --> 00:20:25,027
I've never been so embarrassed,

263
00:20:25,158 --> 00:20:28,075
even when they caught me
selling off thumbtacks.

264
00:20:28,182 --> 00:20:34,106
But you have this weird talent
for provoking people.

265
00:20:34,807 --> 00:20:36,808
Nam Youngchul.

266
00:20:36,982 --> 00:20:38,280
That's your name, right?

267
00:20:38,368 --> 00:20:41,286
You insolent little son of a...
I ought to just...

268
00:20:41,396 --> 00:20:45,222
How can you just
call an elder by his name...

269
00:20:45,792 --> 00:20:48,240
But how did you find that out?

270
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:50,521
I had pretty much forgotten it myself?!

271
00:20:50,635 --> 00:20:53,170
My name is Lee Gangmo.

272
00:20:53,978 --> 00:20:57,154
Why, did I ever ask you that?

273
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:01,719
You will soon meet me again outside.

274
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,393
Really?

275
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:06,029
Afraid that won't be easy.

276
00:21:06,183 --> 00:21:08,459
Forget how I look here,

277
00:21:08,568 --> 00:21:11,506
but I'm quite the big fish outside.

278
00:21:11,618 --> 00:21:13,816
Unless you make it big enough,

279
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,166
you won't even be able to stare at me?!

280
00:21:22,718 --> 00:21:24,821
<i>Look, Director Park!</i>

281
00:21:24,952 --> 00:21:29,253
Does it make sense that you only
completed 20 percent of that road?

282
00:21:29,835 --> 00:21:31,534
I have no time for your excuses,

283
00:21:31,641 --> 00:21:35,550
so focus on finding a way to
complete that road instead.

284
00:21:35,776 --> 00:21:37,968
Ahh... I really...

285
00:21:41,573 --> 00:21:44,258
What are you doing here?

286
00:21:44,401 --> 00:21:48,143
Why? Am I not welcome here?

287
00:21:49,576 --> 00:21:55,493
Find out who set up this shareholders'
meeting, and what's the reason.

288
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,037
All right.

289
00:21:58,285 --> 00:22:01,515
Ahh... What the hell...
As if we weren't busy enough already,

290
00:22:01,621 --> 00:22:05,795
- what wretched fool set up...
- I did.

291
00:22:07,161 --> 00:22:08,563
Say what?

292
00:22:09,668 --> 00:22:11,243
Here's the summon notice.

293
00:22:11,414 --> 00:22:13,602
And the order of the day
is Jeongshik's succession.

294
00:22:13,779 --> 00:22:15,770
What are you prattling about?

295
00:22:15,924 --> 00:22:17,816
I'm a major shareholder myself.

296
00:22:18,015 --> 00:22:19,997
So I have every right to get
involved in company matters.

297
00:22:20,111 --> 00:22:24,407
Do you even know in what
kind of situation we are?

298
00:22:24,562 --> 00:22:26,843
This is no time to be setting
up any shareholders' meeting.

299
00:22:26,973 --> 00:22:32,087
Rumors about Jeongyeon's health concerns
have spread among shareholders.

300
00:22:32,598 --> 00:22:33,394
What?

301
00:22:33,501 --> 00:22:38,491
I beat the board of directors to it,
so find a solution before they bring it up.

302
00:22:38,622 --> 00:22:40,143
A solution?!

303
00:22:41,366 --> 00:22:43,003
Do I have to spell it out?

304
00:22:43,299 --> 00:22:46,519
Proclaim Jeongshik as your heir
and curb their worries.

305
00:22:46,626 --> 00:22:50,428
With Jeongyeon in that state,
do we really need to go that far?

306
00:22:50,546 --> 00:22:52,970
That's exactly what I'd like to ask you.

307
00:22:53,719 --> 00:22:56,726
Did you really need to
force me into this situation?

308
00:22:57,345 --> 00:23:00,402
Doesn't feel like something
you'd come up with...

309
00:23:00,563 --> 00:23:01,870
So who's behind it?

310
00:23:02,025 --> 00:23:04,674
- Who sent you here...
- You...

311
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:07,502
have always looked
down on me, haven't you?

312
00:23:07,728 --> 00:23:11,625
But did all this success get
to your head enough to forget...

313
00:23:11,755 --> 00:23:14,796
that I was the very pillar
which made it possible?

314
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:16,187
Look, Namsuk.

315
00:23:16,282 --> 00:23:20,143
Don't treat me like a fool.

316
00:23:20,987 --> 00:23:23,792
I won't spend the rest of my days
playing the kind and devoted wife.

317
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:34,907
That brat, really...

318
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:50,437
How did it go?

319
00:23:50,579 --> 00:23:52,753
The rumors were true.

320
00:23:53,146 --> 00:23:53,918
What?!

321
00:23:54,037 --> 00:23:58,836
That young lady, Hwang Jeongyeon,
is currently hospitalized for aphasia.

322
00:24:07,162 --> 00:24:10,061
A guest is looking for you, Ma'am.

323
00:24:10,334 --> 00:24:12,009
Tell him she's not in.

324
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:14,666
It was some young lady...

325
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:16,543
Wait.

326
00:24:19,347 --> 00:24:21,034
A young lady?

327
00:24:21,402 --> 00:24:25,323
Yes. The daughter
of Manbo Construction's...

328
00:24:41,191 --> 00:24:43,063
It's been a long time.

329
00:24:43,384 --> 00:24:46,556
You remember me, right?

330
00:24:50,976 --> 00:24:52,687
Have a seat.

331
00:24:53,982 --> 00:24:58,337
I never imagined you owned
so many of our company's shares.

332
00:25:00,713 --> 00:25:04,040
I heard you were hospitalized?!

333
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:07,929
So that's the rumor that's
spreading among shareholders.

334
00:25:08,147 --> 00:25:11,676
As you can see, I'm perfectly fine.

335
00:25:14,563 --> 00:25:20,135
I'd like to order something
to drink, will you join me?

336
00:25:20,325 --> 00:25:21,585
You'll come again, right?

337
00:25:21,704 --> 00:25:24,211
Of course! How can I go on
without seeing my Lola?

338
00:25:24,294 --> 00:25:26,991
- You even remember my name!
- Of course. See you.

339
00:25:27,063 --> 00:25:28,322
See you.

340
00:25:28,369 --> 00:25:32,884
See you soon. Bye Bye!
See you...

341
00:25:34,571 --> 00:25:36,901
Hey... Yeom Gyeongja!

342
00:25:37,589 --> 00:25:40,179
What? "Lola?!"

343
00:25:40,964 --> 00:25:43,506
Is this your "shoe factory?"

344
00:25:44,385 --> 00:25:45,717
Who are you again?

345
00:25:45,821 --> 00:25:48,318
- Waiter! A guest here is acting...
- Stop there!

346
00:25:48,427 --> 00:25:50,005
- You're dead!
- Oppa!

347
00:25:50,088 --> 00:25:53,961
Oppa... Let go...
Know how much this cost?

348
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:58,642
I've heard about the
shareholders' meeting.

349
00:25:59,854 --> 00:26:02,013
Seems like proclaiming
the company heir is at stake.

350
00:26:02,131 --> 00:26:04,436
I'll be honest with you.

351
00:26:05,113 --> 00:26:06,694
My mother...

352
00:26:07,418 --> 00:26:08,631
No...

353
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,596
My stepmother is trying to
position her son as the heir.

354
00:26:15,584 --> 00:26:19,706
Didn't the chairman have you in mind?

355
00:26:19,825 --> 00:26:25,122
While I was hospitalized,
my stepmother won over many shareholders.

356
00:26:25,587 --> 00:26:29,825
And I can't guarantee that my father
will necessarily support me.

357
00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:39,258
I really need your help in this.

358
00:26:39,924 --> 00:26:41,941
I'd like you to support me.

359
00:26:43,699 --> 00:26:48,570
And what would I gain by doing that?

360
00:26:49,735 --> 00:26:52,642
Nothing in life is ever free.

361
00:26:52,931 --> 00:26:57,681
So you'll have to convince me
to offer you my support.

362
00:26:57,988 --> 00:27:01,148
May I ask why you invested
in Manbo Construction?

363
00:27:01,778 --> 00:27:04,673
- That is obviously because...
- If you did it with the company's future in mind,

364
00:27:04,867 --> 00:27:08,258
there is no way you wouldn't
acknowledge what I represent.

365
00:27:08,588 --> 00:27:12,520
And that's because I'm
Manbo Construction's future.

366
00:27:14,029 --> 00:27:16,148
This is the business part of it.

367
00:27:16,382 --> 00:27:21,111
Is there any other aspect
that is not business-related?

368
00:27:28,525 --> 00:27:34,059
I will never let anyone take
this company away from me.

369
00:27:34,985 --> 00:27:36,887
Is that clear?

370
00:27:37,124 --> 00:27:43,480
The future chairman of Manbo Construction
is kneeling before a mere shareholder.

371
00:27:44,264 --> 00:27:48,084
This action has no precedent,

372
00:27:48,512 --> 00:27:50,686
but it will also never repeat itself.

373
00:27:52,278 --> 00:27:58,230
Are you implying that you will
consider me as a lifelong associate?

374
00:27:58,682 --> 00:28:01,631
I prefer the term "family."

375
00:28:02,427 --> 00:28:06,525
It's what has meant the most
to me ever since my childhood.

376
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:13,044
Including yourself, all the
shareholders who will support me...

377
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:15,323
will be considered family.

378
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:18,261
And I believe that is only natural.

379
00:28:21,231 --> 00:28:23,524
Please, get up.

380
00:28:37,489 --> 00:28:40,156
I have no use for things like "family."

381
00:28:40,388 --> 00:28:45,358
All I need from you is to repay
my support with higher dividends.

382
00:28:48,019 --> 00:28:51,631
I will vouch for you at
this shareholders' meeting.

383
00:28:52,408 --> 00:28:55,250
<i>But my support
alone won't turn the tide.</i>

384
00:28:55,926 --> 00:29:01,059
Changing all those shareholders'
minds in the little time you have left...

385
00:29:01,285 --> 00:29:03,732
is only up to you.

386
00:29:05,075 --> 00:29:08,033
I will make sure that happens.

387
00:29:22,065 --> 00:29:24,631
I will succeed.

388
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:33,672
I'll never lose out to the people
responsible for Gangmo's death.

389
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:37,303
Minwoo.

390
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:40,753
They'll probably promote me
to president, this time?

391
00:29:40,978 --> 00:29:44,211
Then, I'll make you
Director of Planning.

392
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:45,291
Forget it.

393
00:29:45,422 --> 00:29:49,124
Ehh... Hey.
What are friends for?

394
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:52,534
What's that?
About the road construction?

395
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:55,753
You're not even running that
project, why waste time on it?

396
00:29:55,848 --> 00:29:57,226
Let's just go out for drinks.

397
00:29:57,333 --> 00:29:59,306
If this project ends up failing,

398
00:29:59,401 --> 00:30:02,061
do you know how it will
affect this year's balance?

399
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:04,068
Let's hear it.

400
00:30:04,402 --> 00:30:07,669
If you want to become president,
first show some interest in this company.

401
00:30:07,752 --> 00:30:11,792
Hey... With you dealing with it,
why should I bother?

402
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:13,291
<i>But, Minwoo.</i>

403
00:30:13,514 --> 00:30:17,144
You didn't hear from that
country chick again, did you?

404
00:30:18,891 --> 00:30:21,338
<i>That's girls for you, these days.</i>

405
00:30:21,457 --> 00:30:25,069
When in need they act as
if you're the second coming,

406
00:30:25,188 --> 00:30:29,387
but look at what happens
after withdrawing that lawsuit.

407
00:30:32,809 --> 00:30:34,080
Listen.

408
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,100
Do you have any gum?

409
00:30:36,254 --> 00:30:37,430
Gum?!

410
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,711
Here.

411
00:30:45,491 --> 00:30:48,046
<i>That shows you women can't be trusted.</i>

412
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:51,241
<i>Need to send them packing
once you've had your fun.</i>

413
00:30:52,453 --> 00:30:54,301
I'll let you work.

414
00:30:57,770 --> 00:31:00,122
<i>You don't have a clue, do you?</i>

415
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:06,614
When you feel down, nothing beats chewing
gum while riding the bus around town.

416
00:31:09,378 --> 00:31:12,218
<i>I said chew it.</i>

417
00:31:16,187 --> 00:31:19,518
The bus is always half-empty
around this time.

418
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:23,237
I won't ask you any tickets,
so come anytime.

419
00:31:23,379 --> 00:31:26,302
<i>Don't feel burdened.</i>

420
00:31:38,376 --> 00:31:40,372
Wait.

421
00:31:41,548 --> 00:31:43,901
Now that I think about it,
she's quite ungrateful.

422
00:31:45,228 --> 00:31:49,066
I withdraw the lawsuit, and
suddenly she's nowhere to be seen?!

423
00:32:23,243 --> 00:32:25,517
Here... Come on out. Quick!

424
00:32:25,672 --> 00:32:29,580
Here... Quick.
Thank you.

425
00:32:31,838 --> 00:32:34,832
Everything clear. All right!

426
00:32:51,555 --> 00:32:52,898
Yes?

427
00:32:54,169 --> 00:32:56,219
Yes, that'd be me.

428
00:32:56,462 --> 00:32:58,056
How did it go?

429
00:32:58,577 --> 00:32:59,895
What?

430
00:33:04,387 --> 00:33:05,551
Yes, I understand.

431
00:33:05,706 --> 00:33:07,381
Thank you.

432
00:33:10,458 --> 00:33:12,121
What is the matter?

433
00:33:13,131 --> 00:33:16,665
They said they're
releasing my brother Gangmo.

434
00:33:16,969 --> 00:33:18,571
That's great to hear.

435
00:33:18,678 --> 00:33:20,591
Then, you're finally
going to live together now?

436
00:33:20,662 --> 00:33:23,823
Wait... I shouldn't
just keep this to myself.

437
00:33:24,203 --> 00:33:28,064
Seonbaenim...
Wouldn't Miju be at work?

438
00:33:29,371 --> 00:33:32,037
Ahh... You're right...

439
00:33:32,738 --> 00:33:34,495
Let's go out for a drink, instead.

440
00:33:34,589 --> 00:33:37,145
That's exactly what you're
in the mood for, isn't it?

441
00:33:37,597 --> 00:33:41,220
Right, Chanseong.
Let's go out for drinks.

442
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,637
I'm so glad.

443
00:34:09,028 --> 00:34:10,085
Driver.

444
00:34:10,204 --> 00:34:12,391
I found a coin here...

445
00:34:13,163 --> 00:34:14,933
Chief!

446
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,854
What are you doing here?

447
00:34:18,985 --> 00:34:20,066
So, what,

448
00:34:20,981 --> 00:34:25,622
just because I withdrew the lawsuit,
you have no more reason to meet me?

449
00:34:26,014 --> 00:34:27,238
I'm sorry...

450
00:34:27,345 --> 00:34:30,208
These days I'm busy practicing singing.

451
00:34:30,363 --> 00:34:33,692
I couldn't be bothered to tell you,

452
00:34:34,604 --> 00:34:37,028
but you're the one who promised
I'd get a lunchbox every day.

453
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:39,170
I'll bring you one tomorrow.

454
00:34:39,609 --> 00:34:43,973
But, did you come all
the way here just for that?

455
00:34:44,504 --> 00:34:45,769
Uh?

456
00:34:46,096 --> 00:34:47,904
Looks like I really made you angry.

457
00:34:48,029 --> 00:34:50,732
Seeing how you came this far.

458
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:56,130
What I hate most are people
who don't keep their word.

459
00:34:56,506 --> 00:35:00,640
I'll bring you kimbap tomorrow,
so don't be angry.

460
00:35:00,759 --> 00:35:02,007
All right?

461
00:35:12,987 --> 00:35:15,648
Why are you staring at me that way?

462
00:35:15,862 --> 00:35:18,959
<i>Is there something on my face?</i>

463
00:35:21,157 --> 00:35:22,298
I'm hungry.

464
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:23,543
Let's go.

465
00:35:23,633 --> 00:35:25,957
<i>Want to eat dinner with me?</i>

466
00:35:26,068 --> 00:35:29,462
But, Chief... I have
no money to buy dinner...

467
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,987
I'll treat you.

468
00:35:31,106 --> 00:35:32,733
Who asked you to pay?

469
00:35:32,959 --> 00:35:37,174
After all you've done for me,
I'd feel sorry letting you pay.

470
00:35:38,797 --> 00:35:44,842
But why are you buying me dinner?

471
00:35:46,125 --> 00:35:48,157
I have no idea, either.

472
00:35:48,751 --> 00:35:50,379
Don't ask that and just come out.

473
00:35:50,497 --> 00:35:51,733
Wait just a moment.

474
00:35:51,828 --> 00:35:54,703
I'll go bring these in
and will be right back.

475
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:06,205
It's today's total.

476
00:36:24,948 --> 00:36:26,481
Hey...

477
00:36:28,417 --> 00:36:29,716
Come here.

478
00:36:29,998 --> 00:36:31,601
What is it?

479
00:36:35,154 --> 00:36:38,393
Is this all you could make today?

480
00:36:39,082 --> 00:36:40,757
You pocketed some, didn't you?

481
00:36:41,244 --> 00:36:42,180
What?!

482
00:36:42,872 --> 00:36:45,240
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

483
00:36:45,533 --> 00:36:47,446
Show me your pockets.

484
00:36:52,142 --> 00:36:55,862
Aigoo, look at this little brat...

485
00:37:02,371 --> 00:37:04,373
What do you call these?

486
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:08,325
Why were these in my pockets?

487
00:37:08,435 --> 00:37:11,574
Raise your hands and turn around.

488
00:37:12,356 --> 00:37:14,863
Before I call the police, do it!

489
00:37:16,583 --> 00:37:18,567
You little...

490
00:37:20,979 --> 00:37:23,581
Ohh Ohh...
What do I have to see...

491
00:37:26,952 --> 00:37:27,851
Don't turn.

492
00:37:28,013 --> 00:37:29,389
Look straight.

493
00:37:29,553 --> 00:37:34,003
Don't move a finger and just stay put.

494
00:37:44,883 --> 00:37:47,404
Stay put, are we clear?

495
00:37:47,615 --> 00:37:49,885
So we're clear...

496
00:37:54,668 --> 00:37:56,066
What are you trying to do?

497
00:37:56,155 --> 00:37:58,399
- Just stay put...
- Don't!

498
00:37:58,506 --> 00:38:01,699
- I said don't move!
- I didn't pocket anything!

499
00:38:01,804 --> 00:38:04,879
- Don't do this, please!
- Should I just call the police?

500
00:38:11,458 --> 00:38:13,802
<i>You little slut...</i>

501
00:38:17,742 --> 00:38:19,196
I'm innocent.

502
00:38:19,489 --> 00:38:22,166
I didn't steal anything!

503
00:38:24,394 --> 00:38:26,126
Just stay put...

504
00:38:26,307 --> 00:38:28,077
You little...

505
00:38:40,311 --> 00:38:42,581
Chief...

506
00:38:45,206 --> 00:38:46,929
And you are?

507
00:39:07,315 --> 00:39:10,584
Please stop, Chief!

508
00:39:11,319 --> 00:39:14,966
You'll kill him... Stop!

509
00:39:17,113 --> 00:39:19,430
You scumbag...

510
00:39:43,333 --> 00:39:45,745
Thank you, Chief.

511
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:52,434
For rescuing me.

512
00:39:54,537 --> 00:39:57,350
If it weren't for you, I'd...

513
00:40:04,312 --> 00:40:06,906
Chief.

514
00:40:09,154 --> 00:40:10,770
Thank God.

515
00:40:11,649 --> 00:40:13,812
Nothing happened.

516
00:40:34,635 --> 00:40:36,827
My Miju's a little late?!

517
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:38,193
Big Oppa...

518
00:40:38,288 --> 00:40:40,154
When did you get here?

519
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:43,706
Thought I'd grow old waiting for you.

520
00:40:51,695 --> 00:40:53,335
Miju.

521
00:40:55,046 --> 00:40:57,612
You have time tomorrow?

522
00:40:58,669 --> 00:41:00,665
I'll have plenty of time from now on.

523
00:41:00,832 --> 00:41:03,442
I quit my job at the bus company.

524
00:41:03,549 --> 00:41:04,917
Really?

525
00:41:05,154 --> 00:41:07,588
That's really good to hear.

526
00:41:08,814 --> 00:41:10,502
But, why are you asking?

527
00:41:10,691 --> 00:41:12,176
Tomorrow...

528
00:41:12,817 --> 00:41:14,752
Gangmo is coming out!

529
00:41:15,156 --> 00:41:16,273
Really?

530
00:41:16,416 --> 00:41:18,387
Sure... I told you, didn't I?

531
00:41:18,489 --> 00:41:21,047
That I'd soon get him out of there.

532
00:41:21,703 --> 00:41:23,342
Oppa!

533
00:41:25,861 --> 00:41:27,852
We'll leave early in the morning,

534
00:41:27,961 --> 00:41:29,741
so let's go to sleep.

535
00:41:30,036 --> 00:41:34,009
Now we can all live together?

536
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:36,084
Sure.

537
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:40,036
Now we won't have to separate again.

538
00:41:40,336 --> 00:41:44,965
Oppa... This feels like a dream.

539
00:41:49,135 --> 00:41:54,886
From now on, I'll make
you dream every day.

540
00:41:56,146 --> 00:41:58,297
Oppa...

541
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:16,435
Oppa, how do I look?

542
00:42:16,788 --> 00:42:18,369
Did I put on too much make-up?

543
00:42:18,534 --> 00:42:19,991
You look pretty.

544
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:22,657
Why? Wanted to look
pretty for your brother?

545
00:42:22,787 --> 00:42:26,566
Of course!
How long has it been?!

546
00:42:29,607 --> 00:42:31,900
It's him!

547
00:42:32,233 --> 00:42:33,848
Oppa!

548
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:38,236
Miju.

549
00:42:38,354 --> 00:42:40,723
Gangmo Oppa!

550
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:50,907
<i>Oppa...</i>

551
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:04,167
Hyung.

552
00:43:19,833 --> 00:43:22,854
<i>- Miju, have this.
- Miju, eat some.</i>

553
00:43:24,671 --> 00:43:26,486
Which one are you going to choose?

554
00:43:26,564 --> 00:43:28,726
If you don't choose mine,
I'm not eating.

555
00:43:28,821 --> 00:43:30,391
It's not even cooked well,
just eat mine.

556
00:43:30,481 --> 00:43:31,791
Nah... Nah...
That's all burned.

557
00:43:31,886 --> 00:43:34,298
- What are you saying?
- Here, eat it.

558
00:43:43,943 --> 00:43:45,832
It's so good.

559
00:43:46,474 --> 00:43:49,931
I knew such a happy day would come.

560
00:43:51,677 --> 00:43:53,780
Reminds me of when we were little.

561
00:43:53,911 --> 00:43:55,757
Was it Mom's birthday?

562
00:43:55,947 --> 00:44:01,008
I told them I wanted pork ribs,
and Dad ordered boiled rice.

563
00:44:01,745 --> 00:44:02,995
I remember.

564
00:44:03,218 --> 00:44:07,898
I joked with Dad,
telling him he was a cheapskate.

565
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:13,821
To save and buy land in Gangnam,
Dad had no money to spend.

566
00:44:13,974 --> 00:44:16,476
If only we hadn't lost those land deeds,

567
00:44:16,583 --> 00:44:19,777
we'd have land and be rich by now.

568
00:44:20,385 --> 00:44:23,279
But we have a lot of land?

569
00:44:23,368 --> 00:44:26,146
Ahh... Right!
You bought some, right?

570
00:44:26,265 --> 00:44:27,628
Hyung, let's finish this and get up.

571
00:44:27,736 --> 00:44:29,684
- Let's go see our land.
- Right.

572
00:44:29,779 --> 00:44:31,516
I'm so excited!

573
00:44:31,671 --> 00:44:35,065
Hurry up and eat, Oppa.
I can't wait to see it.

574
00:44:52,458 --> 00:44:57,166
Out of this huge place,
what is our land?

575
00:44:57,412 --> 00:44:59,723
How far do you think it stretches?

576
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:10,299
Does our land end here?

577
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:14,295
No. Go farther ahead.

578
00:45:23,315 --> 00:45:25,210
Is it here?

579
00:45:26,202 --> 00:45:30,535
No. You must continue.

580
00:45:40,906 --> 00:45:43,615
Then, here?

581
00:45:44,981 --> 00:45:46,772
Miju!

582
00:45:47,132 --> 00:45:49,639
Turn around and look!

583
00:45:53,216 --> 00:45:55,782
How far can you see?

584
00:46:01,948 --> 00:46:04,499
I can't see where it ends.

585
00:46:05,192 --> 00:46:09,996
All the land your eyes can see is ours!

586
00:46:11,297 --> 00:46:13,815
Ehh... Liar!

587
00:46:14,053 --> 00:46:15,827
He's right, Miju!

588
00:46:16,037 --> 00:46:18,496
That's our land!

589
00:46:34,952 --> 00:46:37,316
<i>Tell Jeongyeon.</i>

590
00:46:38,195 --> 00:46:40,132
That Lee Gangmo...

591
00:46:41,355 --> 00:46:46,820
was ruthless enough to
choose those mudflats over her.

592
00:46:47,172 --> 00:46:49,216
Forget that woman.

593
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:00,894
Big Oppa!

594
00:47:02,973 --> 00:47:05,965
Little Oppa!

595
00:47:06,216 --> 00:47:08,486
Hurry up and come!

596
00:47:08,802 --> 00:47:11,515
Quick!

597
00:47:13,056 --> 00:47:14,921
Gangmo...

598
00:47:16,347 --> 00:47:18,070
Hyung!

599
00:47:20,244 --> 00:47:24,778
Seongmo Oppa! Gangmo Oppa!

600
00:48:37,206 --> 00:48:38,859
A construction company?

601
00:48:38,958 --> 00:48:40,295
Yeah.

602
00:48:41,637 --> 00:48:44,633
I plan to start by building
roads in the provinces.

603
00:48:44,928 --> 00:48:51,122
Until your sentence is over,
you won't be able to reclaim your name.

604
00:48:51,681 --> 00:48:54,425
You must keep hiding and
using that alias, James Lee.

605
00:48:54,591 --> 00:48:57,431
I already have a plan.

606
00:48:58,453 --> 00:49:01,295
Once the price of this land goes up,

607
00:49:01,576 --> 00:49:05,009
I'll start fighting with
Manbo Construction for real.

608
00:49:05,544 --> 00:49:07,195
<i>In preparation for that day,</i>

609
00:49:07,647 --> 00:49:11,009
we must build our foundations
through road construction.

610
00:49:20,781 --> 00:49:23,594
It's all the money
I saved over the years.

611
00:49:23,918 --> 00:49:25,596
You use it.

612
00:49:26,247 --> 00:49:27,170
Hyung...

613
00:49:27,289 --> 00:49:30,057
You'll have plenty
of expenses from now on.

614
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:33,408
You'll have to find yourself
a place to live as well.

615
00:49:34,251 --> 00:49:36,699
Use this to get started.

616
00:49:41,564 --> 00:49:43,061
Thanks, Hyung.

617
00:49:43,739 --> 00:49:45,990
Thanks for what?

618
00:49:47,303 --> 00:49:52,216
You can't avenge our father
all by yourself.

619
00:49:53,558 --> 00:49:56,160
While you take care of Hwang Taeseop,

620
00:49:57,075 --> 00:49:59,998
I will bring forth
Jo Pilyeon's destruction.

621
00:50:04,263 --> 00:50:07,295
If you need anything,
don't hesitate to ask me.

622
00:50:09,493 --> 00:50:11,751
If you and I join forces,

623
00:50:12,547 --> 00:50:14,807
there is nothing
that can scare us off.

624
00:50:33,269 --> 00:50:35,679
Did you look into
those mudflats in Gaepo?

625
00:50:36,002 --> 00:50:38,282
I did try through my
contacts in the States,

626
00:50:38,568 --> 00:50:41,075
but there was no way
to find the owner.

627
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:45,780
Must we really lose that goldmine
without being able to do a thing?

628
00:50:46,366 --> 00:50:49,738
There is still time until the
development plan is announced.

629
00:50:50,061 --> 00:50:51,855
James Lee, you said?

630
00:50:52,045 --> 00:50:53,245
Yes.

631
00:50:54,172 --> 00:50:56,108
First I'll have to win the elections,

632
00:50:56,286 --> 00:50:59,191
and then get my hands on that land.

633
00:51:01,472 --> 00:51:04,098
The boss of the
Maljukgeori gang contacted us.

634
00:51:04,407 --> 00:51:05,371
When is it?

635
00:51:05,548 --> 00:51:07,460
It's set for tonight.

636
00:51:07,959 --> 00:51:10,347
What are you planning to do?

637
00:51:11,096 --> 00:51:13,300
<i>{\a6}*"the fox borrows the tiger's roar"</i>

638
00:51:11,096 --> 00:51:13,300
Ever heard of that
"hogahowi*" saying?

639
00:51:13,454 --> 00:51:16,044
When what you lack is power,

640
00:51:17,292 --> 00:51:19,882
then you'll have to ask
a tiger for assistance.

641
00:51:26,302 --> 00:51:28,036
<i>Take this money,</i>

642
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:31,066
and do us a favor.

643
00:51:31,921 --> 00:51:35,295
If you want me to betray Min Honggi...

644
00:51:36,163 --> 00:51:41,011
- Forget about it.
- Isn't power what you're after, anyway?

645
00:51:41,142 --> 00:51:43,589
- So?
- Min Honggi,

646
00:51:45,075 --> 00:51:50,547
compared to Candidate Jo Pilyeon,
can't hold a candle.

647
00:51:58,451 --> 00:52:03,191
I'll just go next door
and have a drink.

648
00:52:18,706 --> 00:52:20,968
<i>I brought him.</i>

649
00:52:21,275 --> 00:52:24,449
Why, did you have
another guest other than me?

650
00:52:24,697 --> 00:52:26,669
Come on in.

651
00:52:32,652 --> 00:52:34,180
Sit.

652
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:40,953
Let's start with some introductions.

653
00:52:41,111 --> 00:52:46,933
<i>Over here is my army mate, not to
mention the ANSP Chief of Support.</i>

654
00:52:49,511 --> 00:52:51,673
Who is this man?

655
00:52:53,693 --> 00:52:58,534
He's a gang boss with
seven prior convictions.

656
00:52:59,738 --> 00:53:03,932
A rat bastard wagging
his tail under Min Honggi.

657
00:53:05,512 --> 00:53:07,807
Why bring street thugs here...

658
00:53:13,149 --> 00:53:16,808
I used this back in my KCIA days.

659
00:53:16,951 --> 00:53:19,173
Took a liking to it,
so I couldn't give it back.

660
00:53:19,363 --> 00:53:21,121
It only has a few bullets left.

661
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:26,418
What's wrong with you?

662
00:53:26,954 --> 00:53:30,568
If I get rid of him in front of you,
you could easily cover it up.

663
00:53:30,679 --> 00:53:32,484
You really!

664
00:53:33,108 --> 00:53:36,209
I get a little trigger-happy when I
see scummy thugs like you prance around.

665
00:53:36,375 --> 00:53:39,657
Human trash oppressing the weak and
getting on all fours with the strong.

666
00:53:39,753 --> 00:53:43,545
What's wrong with you?

667
00:53:44,199 --> 00:53:49,519
If only I wasn't confident I could win
these elections, you'd be dead already.

668
00:53:49,712 --> 00:53:54,052
<i>However, I will win them at all cost.</i>

669
00:53:54,931 --> 00:53:57,225
But don't feel too relieved.

670
00:53:57,485 --> 00:53:59,184
Once I become a congressman,

671
00:53:59,315 --> 00:54:05,029
I'll take human trash like you
off my area's streets right away.

672
00:54:07,195 --> 00:54:08,585
Is that clear?

673
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:12,232
Whether I win or lose those elections,

674
00:54:13,135 --> 00:54:15,369
you're still a dead man.

675
00:54:23,187 --> 00:54:25,717
Get the hell out of my sight.

676
00:54:31,811 --> 00:54:35,138
What did you subject me to
this pathetic spectacle for?

677
00:54:40,152 --> 00:54:41,708
<i>Two big ones for you.</i>

678
00:54:41,874 --> 00:54:45,032
<i>Once the elections are over,
three more will come your way.</i>

679
00:54:45,424 --> 00:54:51,400
Should be enough to "borrow
your roar," don't you think?

680
00:54:52,683 --> 00:54:56,782
Your temper still hasn't
died quite yet, I see.

681
00:55:16,614 --> 00:55:18,199
Where have you been?

682
00:55:18,339 --> 00:55:21,070
I've been waiting for you.

683
00:55:24,206 --> 00:55:29,713
We never prepared
any memorial for them.

684
00:55:30,046 --> 00:55:32,535
Now that we're all back together,

685
00:55:32,778 --> 00:55:35,816
we need to honor them.

686
00:55:36,034 --> 00:55:37,647
Miju...

687
00:56:24,889 --> 00:56:26,588
Father.

688
00:56:28,382 --> 00:56:30,011
Mother.

689
00:56:35,108 --> 00:56:37,972
You've felt sad all
these years, haven't you?

690
00:56:40,574 --> 00:56:42,641
After all this time...

691
00:56:44,886 --> 00:56:47,393
living away from each other,

692
00:56:48,783 --> 00:56:51,087
we only now got together.

693
00:56:53,130 --> 00:56:55,100
Mom...

694
00:56:55,351 --> 00:56:57,347
Dad...

695
00:57:03,477 --> 00:57:06,998
You must have been hungry,
all this time?

696
00:57:09,074 --> 00:57:12,998
You suffered so much
even while alive...

697
00:57:16,562 --> 00:57:22,470
<i>Now that we could repay you
for all you did...</i>

698
00:57:24,418 --> 00:57:26,391
<i>Forgive me.</i>

699
00:57:27,721 --> 00:57:31,053
<i>It's all my fault, Father.</i>

700
00:57:33,536 --> 00:57:35,829
Forgive me, Father...

701
00:57:36,637 --> 00:57:38,787
It's all because of me, Mother.

702
00:57:38,906 --> 00:57:41,247
I'm sorry...

703
00:57:45,294 --> 00:57:48,371
I miss you both...

704
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,486
I miss you so much.

705
00:57:58,595 --> 00:58:01,007
<i>Be our witness.</i>

706
00:58:02,171 --> 00:58:05,142
<i>All those who brought death upon you,</i>

707
00:58:06,104 --> 00:58:08,991
<i>those who subjected
us to so much suffering,</i>

708
00:58:09,502 --> 00:58:11,513
<i>will never be forgiven.</i>

709
00:58:12,606 --> 00:58:14,198
<i>You just wait.</i>

710
00:58:15,291 --> 00:58:17,144
<i>I will avenge you,</i>

711
00:58:17,821 --> 00:58:21,802
<i>and then succeed.</i>

712
00:59:07,024 --> 00:59:09,314
You said Nam Youngchul, right?

713
00:59:09,958 --> 00:59:12,120
<i>It's all the info I could find.</i>

714
00:59:15,815 --> 00:59:17,246
Right...

715
00:59:17,852 --> 00:59:20,017
You know a man called Baekpa?

716
00:59:20,359 --> 00:59:22,094
Baekpa?!

717
00:59:23,638 --> 00:59:26,163
That lending kingpin from Myeong-Dong?

718
00:59:26,288 --> 00:59:27,333
Yeah...

719
00:59:27,523 --> 00:59:29,852
I need his help to get things started.

720
00:59:29,947 --> 00:59:32,090
Go for another private lender.

721
00:59:32,357 --> 00:59:33,747
I can introduce you to one,
if you want.

722
00:59:33,866 --> 00:59:37,074
I might need the money,
but I also need people like him.

723
00:59:37,228 --> 00:59:40,412
If things go wrong,
he could ruin you.

724
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:44,805
Anyhow, find out
what you can about him.

725
00:59:44,983 --> 00:59:46,278
His business style,

726
00:59:46,397 --> 00:59:49,422
his eating habits,
hobbies, everything.

727
00:59:51,850 --> 00:59:56,366
You haven't heard about
Manbo Construction, right?

728
00:59:57,947 --> 01:00:03,008
Seems like things are a bit chaotic
over there, because of the heir issue.

729
01:00:10,952 --> 01:00:13,149
Jeongyeon.

730
01:00:13,626 --> 01:00:15,384
Jeongyeon.

731
01:00:17,309 --> 01:00:22,702
There soon will be a
shareholders' meeting.

732
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:28,090
You must recover before then.

733
01:00:30,086 --> 01:00:31,321
Listen to me.

734
01:00:31,476 --> 01:00:35,052
You must start speaking, understand?

735
01:00:38,363 --> 01:00:44,006
I'm so disheartened,
it's driving me crazy.

736
01:01:25,116 --> 01:01:30,038
<i>I buy used newspapers!</i>

737
01:01:30,167 --> 01:01:37,494
Here! I buy broken radios
and used newspapers!

738
01:01:37,637 --> 01:01:40,203
Used news...

739
01:01:41,534 --> 01:01:43,684
The hell is this?

740
01:01:45,169 --> 01:01:47,213
<i>What's with the car...</i>

741
01:01:47,344 --> 01:01:50,911
Seems a little too early
to sell it off?!

742
01:01:51,021 --> 01:01:53,355
<i>And you said you made it big outside.</i>

743
01:01:53,593 --> 01:01:55,206
I see you run your own business?!

744
01:01:55,387 --> 01:01:58,259
Oh my! Who's this?

745
01:01:58,877 --> 01:02:01,324
No. 534?!

746
01:02:10,269 --> 01:02:12,418
Red hunt!

747
01:02:22,497 --> 01:02:25,019
Eat this... this... this!

748
01:02:26,192 --> 01:02:28,367
See how I grace your walls, you...

749
01:02:28,533 --> 01:02:30,018
Red! Hunt!

750
01:02:30,149 --> 01:02:31,687
Here you go, you pricks.

751
01:02:33,939 --> 01:02:35,708
It's coming.

752
01:02:43,704 --> 01:02:45,565
Congrats on your release.

753
01:02:46,044 --> 01:02:48,611
What son of a
motherless cunt said that?

754
01:02:48,729 --> 01:02:50,809
Ever seen me get...

755
01:02:58,226 --> 01:03:00,852
G...Gangmo!

756
01:03:02,115 --> 01:03:03,380
Gangmo!

757
01:03:03,477 --> 01:03:05,620
Gangmo!

758
01:03:10,076 --> 01:03:13,153
Gangmo!

759
01:03:20,170 --> 01:03:23,179
There is a way to
reduce construction costs.

760
01:03:23,357 --> 01:03:24,391
And what is that?

761
01:03:24,521 --> 01:03:27,515
Instead of using sand and gravel,

762
01:03:27,670 --> 01:03:29,559
by taking advantage of
that land's existing mud.

763
01:03:29,650 --> 01:03:32,565
You won't use sand and gravel?!

764
01:03:32,743 --> 01:03:35,226
If you do that,
the ground will be too weak,

765
01:03:35,345 --> 01:03:39,178
and will collapse even with
asphalt on it, you fool.

766
01:03:39,344 --> 01:03:43,443
Remember when we used calcium
chloride to tighten the concrete?

767
01:03:44,263 --> 01:03:47,565
If we could only find how
to tighten up that mud,

768
01:03:48,053 --> 01:03:49,838
then it's actually feasible.

769
01:03:49,954 --> 01:03:54,963
Wow... I've always thought that,
but you really are smart.

770
01:03:55,093 --> 01:03:56,614
Isn't that right?

771
01:03:56,972 --> 01:03:59,941
But why did you take damaged
goods along for the ride?

772
01:04:00,036 --> 01:04:02,044
What... Take what?

773
01:04:02,192 --> 01:04:04,557
Who are you calling damaged goods?

774
01:04:05,246 --> 01:04:07,051
Aigoo...

775
01:04:07,777 --> 01:04:09,622
Gangmo, listen.

776
01:04:09,742 --> 01:04:15,530
Do you have enough
money to get started?

777
01:04:15,986 --> 01:04:18,735
I'll have to start finding it.

778
01:04:25,935 --> 01:04:27,657
A customer is looking for you, Sir.

779
01:04:27,812 --> 01:04:28,790
Who?

780
01:04:28,929 --> 01:04:30,122
I've never seen him before.

781
01:04:30,212 --> 01:04:31,610
Seemed like a businessman.

782
01:04:31,717 --> 01:04:33,653
Tell him to come in.

783
01:04:35,958 --> 01:04:37,933
If you will.

784
01:04:45,642 --> 01:04:47,472
Nice to meet you.

785
01:04:47,983 --> 01:04:49,967
Have a seat.

786
01:04:57,754 --> 01:05:03,041
So, what brings you here?

787
01:05:03,195 --> 01:05:04,765
Let's start with the introductions.

788
01:05:05,061 --> 01:05:07,151
My name is James Lee.

789
01:05:08,114 --> 01:05:11,496
James... Lee?!

796
01:05:34,421 --> 01:05:37,555
For the time being,
we'll have to live apart.

797
01:05:37,786 --> 01:05:40,198
I see selling drinks can
make you quite the sum?!

798
01:05:40,293 --> 01:05:41,505
Why don't you get to the point?

799
01:05:41,624 --> 01:05:43,822
I want you to support
Jeongshik as the company heir.

800
01:05:43,917 --> 01:05:47,172
The woman who gave birth to
Jeongyeon was just a bar girl.

801
01:05:47,528 --> 01:05:51,057
<i>I hear someone from within
the ANSP was helping Min Honggi.</i>

802
01:05:51,152 --> 01:05:52,126
And who is that?

803
01:05:52,210 --> 01:05:53,136
Find that out.

804
01:05:53,196 --> 01:05:55,881
From now on in, you stick to Seongmo.

805
01:05:56,011 --> 01:05:58,815
<i>The only way to fight with a huge
player like Manbo Construction...</i>
