{\a6}- Episode 37 -

4
00:00:07,029 --> 00:00:11,493
Let me introduce a great newcomer
who will stir up the scene like no other!

5
00:00:11,667 --> 00:00:14,030
Give her an applause!

6
00:00:49,478 --> 00:00:50,385
What are you doing?

7
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:51,507
Hey... Music.

8
00:00:51,594 --> 00:00:53,681
<i>Turn it on!</i>

9
00:01:07,712 --> 00:01:09,335
Hey... This won't do it.

10
00:01:09,451 --> 00:01:12,321
Get her off the stage
and turn the lights off.

11
00:01:27,929 --> 00:01:33,609
<i>{\a6}- Lee Eunha's Don't Cry For Me -</i>

12
00:01:27,929 --> 00:01:33,609
Don't cry for me.

13
00:01:34,784 --> 00:01:40,127
Don't be sad for me.

14
00:01:41,664 --> 00:01:46,780
<i>Don't stare at me that way,</i>

15
00:01:48,577 --> 00:01:54,026
With that expressionless face.

16
00:01:55,272 --> 00:02:01,518
Don't fall in love with me.

17
00:02:01,852 --> 00:02:08,127
It's too late by now.

18
00:02:09,084 --> 00:02:14,776
Don't hold your breath waiting for me,

19
00:02:15,994 --> 00:02:22,182
Because our love is now over.

20
00:02:29,506 --> 00:02:35,260
Why did you just
make me leave that day,

21
00:02:35,434 --> 00:02:40,739
If you knew you'd
end up regretting it so much?

22
00:02:41,362 --> 00:02:49,425
You wouldn't have had to
suffer through all these ordeals.

23
00:02:52,137 --> 00:02:57,862
I no longer feel any love for you,

24
00:02:58,007 --> 00:03:03,394
Or any other feeling,

25
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:11,785
Just like when you sent me away 
with that empty smile of yours.

26
00:03:11,945 --> 00:03:17,633
Why did you just
make me leave that day,

27
00:03:17,778 --> 00:03:23,185
If you knew you'd
end up regretting it so much?

28
00:03:23,619 --> 00:03:32,153
You wouldn't have had to
suffer through all these ordeals.

29
00:03:34,487 --> 00:03:40,109
I no longer feel any love for you,

30
00:03:40,217 --> 00:03:45,879
Or any other feeling,

31
00:03:46,082 --> 00:03:54,555
Just like when you sent me away 
with that empty smile of yours.

32
00:03:55,273 --> 00:04:00,233
With that empty smile of yours.

33
00:04:00,969 --> 00:04:05,455
With that empty smile of yours.

34
00:05:09,191 --> 00:05:10,762
What are you doing?
Tell her to come out!

35
00:05:10,856 --> 00:05:12,658
Yes, Manager!

36
00:05:28,146 --> 00:05:29,842
Taxi!

37
00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:33,434
<i>Wait!</i>

38
00:05:33,536 --> 00:05:35,081
<i>Wait there!</i>

39
00:05:35,192 --> 00:05:37,798
<i>Wait! Wait!</i>

40
00:05:42,161 --> 00:05:43,428
She's disappeared?!

41
00:05:43,559 --> 00:05:46,515
Yes... I think she just took off.

42
00:05:46,675 --> 00:05:48,139
What's her name?

43
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:51,697
They introduced her to us
in a rush, so we couldn't...

44
00:05:51,965 --> 00:05:53,834
Look for her number and find her.

45
00:05:53,994 --> 00:05:57,313
All right, Di...Director.

46
00:06:08,297 --> 00:06:11,428
After all I did 
to get this opportunity...

47
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:16,020
Should have done 
a little better, you fool.

48
00:06:16,455 --> 00:06:18,426
<i>Where should I take you, Miss?</i>

49
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,290
What?

50
00:06:20,817 --> 00:06:23,146
Hannam-Dong, please.

51
00:06:29,702 --> 00:06:31,091
<i>Take a look here.</i>

52
00:06:31,197 --> 00:06:32,225
<i>What's that?</i>

53
00:06:32,339 --> 00:06:33,615
<i>Don't!</i>

54
00:06:33,745 --> 00:06:36,438
<i>I'm shooting a film.</i>

55
00:06:36,615 --> 00:06:40,556
<i>A film by Jo Minwoo, starring Lee Miju.</i>

56
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:43,535
<i>But better give up any box office hopes.</i>

57
00:06:43,678 --> 00:06:46,166
<i>My leading star is too ugly for that...</i>

58
00:06:49,619 --> 00:06:53,242
<i>You're not making it any better, 
staring at me that way.</i>

59
00:06:57,359 --> 00:06:59,562
<i>And now, Lee Miju sings a song.</i>

60
00:06:59,707 --> 00:07:01,040
What?

61
00:07:01,794 --> 00:07:03,375
Go ahead and do it.

62
00:07:03,663 --> 00:07:05,273
Come on.

63
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:17,011
<i>{\a6}- Jo Yongpil's Bobbed Hair -</i>

64
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:17,011
I recall this lady who
always brought me flowers.

65
00:07:18,141 --> 00:07:25,050
I wonder why I
miss her so much today.

66
00:07:26,514 --> 00:07:33,500
Her bobbed hair,
finely combed like wet weeds.

67
00:07:35,877 --> 00:07:42,108
Those glittering eyes of hers,
haunting my heart.

68
00:07:43,717 --> 00:07:47,992
<i>Whenever I feel down,</i>

69
00:07:48,239 --> 00:07:52,090
<i>Those days come back to mind.</i>

70
00:08:19,363 --> 00:08:21,537
<i>{\a6}- Suseo Housing Area Business Conference -</i>

71
00:08:19,363 --> 00:08:21,537
I am truly grateful 
for your participation.

72
00:08:21,624 --> 00:08:26,600
Today's conference involves concessions
for the new Suseo residential area.

73
00:08:26,687 --> 00:08:30,427
<i>This project's foremost purpose is dealing
with the metropolitan area's housing shortage,</i>

74
00:08:30,528 --> 00:08:32,340
<i>while at the same time creating
an eco-friendly example...</i>

75
00:08:32,485 --> 00:08:35,065
<i>that will hopefully put an end
to sprawled development,</i>

76
00:08:35,152 --> 00:08:39,587
<i>by developing a residential stronghold
alongside neighboring Suwon and Yongin.</i>

77
00:08:39,702 --> 00:08:42,887
<i>We will now look at how the Suseo 
residential area will be partitioned.</i>

78
00:08:42,994 --> 00:08:45,093
<i>We will divide it 
into six areas in total,</i>

79
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:46,777
<i>so let's begin by looking at Area A.</i>

80
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:54,487
<i>With construction starting in 1986,
the planned completion is for 1988.</i>

81
00:08:56,473 --> 00:09:01,189
And that concludes our conference call
on the Suseo residential area project.

82
00:09:01,362 --> 00:09:05,594
The Deputy Major will now give us 
a few comments on the matter.

83
00:09:10,276 --> 00:09:13,512
As everyone should know,

84
00:09:13,711 --> 00:09:16,423
<i>out of all the construction 
firms present today,</i>

85
00:09:16,628 --> 00:09:19,859
<i>only a selected few
will take part in this project.</i>

86
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:24,990
<i>Just as you can expect a fair 
and balanced assessment from us,</i>

87
00:09:25,193 --> 00:09:29,764
we ask you to accept any verdict 
in the spirit of fair competition.

88
00:09:30,005 --> 00:09:31,852
That would be all.

89
00:09:59,506 --> 00:10:01,445
<i>Lee Gangmo.</i>

90
00:10:09,584 --> 00:10:11,599
<i>Baby...</i>

91
00:10:11,976 --> 00:10:13,874
Baby...

92
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:38,035
Just letting you know in case you were 
already preparing a champagne bottle...

93
00:10:38,254 --> 00:10:42,819
Minnows like you won't
even enter this Suseo pond.

94
00:10:43,022 --> 00:10:45,377
You're just a competitor like us...

95
00:10:45,587 --> 00:10:48,280
Doesn't feel like anything
you should be bothered with?!

96
00:10:48,529 --> 00:10:50,718
Competitor?!

97
00:10:52,425 --> 00:10:54,177
You still believe that?

98
00:10:54,269 --> 00:10:55,610
Why...

99
00:10:55,816 --> 00:10:58,639
Will you try to lobby
my way out of this, again?

100
00:10:58,747 --> 00:11:00,135
Lobbying is a business, too.

101
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:01,657
But maybe you're too green 
to understand that.

102
00:11:01,778 --> 00:11:07,048
People who only depend on lobbying
are no businessmen, they're just brokers.

103
00:11:07,957 --> 00:11:09,643
Anyhow,

104
00:11:09,812 --> 00:11:12,327
it's survival of the fittest here.

105
00:11:12,566 --> 00:11:14,886
All you can become
is bait for the big fish.

106
00:11:15,044 --> 00:11:17,175
Are you really sure about that?

107
00:11:17,725 --> 00:11:20,363
But, you know...
My eating habits are a bit eccentric.

108
00:11:20,533 --> 00:11:22,581
Any time I see minnows 
trying to act like big fish,

109
00:11:22,747 --> 00:11:24,067
I get the urge to devour them?!

110
00:11:24,168 --> 00:11:24,879
<i>Say what?!</i>

111
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:26,154
<i>Is that all you can say?</i>

112
00:11:26,212 --> 00:11:28,763
<i>Why, did I say anything wrong?</i>

113
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:38,865
Saw that?

114
00:11:39,183 --> 00:11:42,102
Tail between your legs 
when dealing with the strong,

115
00:11:42,265 --> 00:11:45,059
and then going at each other's
throats when they're not around.

116
00:11:45,392 --> 00:11:49,146
<i>That's what you weaklings do.</i>

117
00:11:49,894 --> 00:11:52,639
If you want to go at
anyone's throats, go for ours.

118
00:11:52,987 --> 00:11:55,911
We're the ones who are taking
food away from your table.

119
00:11:56,969 --> 00:11:58,969
Strong, weaklings...

120
00:11:59,274 --> 00:12:01,853
Wouldn't waste time with
such big words if I were you.

121
00:12:02,201 --> 00:12:06,665
Because they're not going to
help you win this showdown.

122
00:12:06,883 --> 00:12:11,810
Is the world really as idealistic
as you make it out to be?

123
00:12:33,849 --> 00:12:39,690
Do you really believe we'll get a
chance to participate in this project?

124
00:12:39,893 --> 00:12:41,313
I can't say,

125
00:12:41,508 --> 00:12:44,647
but shouldn't we create our own opportunities 
instead of just waiting for them?

126
00:12:44,777 --> 00:12:46,607
You don't create opportunities,

127
00:12:46,884 --> 00:12:50,377
they are given to you after
being chosen by the higher-ups.

128
00:12:50,826 --> 00:12:53,565
Right as we speak, we might be 
sharing a bottle of cheap soju,

129
00:12:53,757 --> 00:12:56,841
but the construction committee will be
already putting its lobbying power to use.

130
00:12:57,044 --> 00:12:59,076
It's game over already.

131
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:01,927
That's the wretched reality we're facing.

132
00:13:09,232 --> 00:13:12,754
Manbo Construction will be dealing
with the everglades in Suseo.

133
00:13:13,015 --> 00:13:15,781
Your respective areas are listed there.

134
00:13:15,914 --> 00:13:21,262
Then, the only lot left 
is Area B, isn't it?

135
00:13:21,436 --> 00:13:24,190
Area B... Isn't that Dolsan*?

135
00:13:21,436 --> 00:13:24,190
<i>{\a6}*literal meaning: rocky mountain</i>

136
00:13:24,378 --> 00:13:26,065
That's right.

137
00:13:26,378 --> 00:13:30,256
We'll let the other competitors
fight each other over that area.

138
00:13:30,365 --> 00:13:32,147
It's pretty obvious it'd be
more trouble than it's worth,

139
00:13:32,321 --> 00:13:33,754
who would ever 
undertake such a project?

140
00:13:33,841 --> 00:13:36,713
That's for them to worry about.

141
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:40,290
As long as we can live up to our
end of the bargain, that'll be all.

142
00:13:40,421 --> 00:13:45,608
But... Are you sure they're 
going to follow this plan?

143
00:13:45,721 --> 00:13:48,697
The reason I preside over 
this committee...

144
00:13:49,071 --> 00:13:54,222
is because I have never
disappointed you in matters like this.

145
00:13:57,353 --> 00:13:59,744
Isn't that right?

146
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:10,848
It's been such a long time...

147
00:14:10,941 --> 00:14:13,254
Can't ignore each other 
like that, can we?

148
00:14:18,008 --> 00:14:20,559
Is there anything I can help you with?

149
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:23,591
Will you do me a favor?

150
00:14:23,823 --> 00:14:25,324
Sure.

151
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:29,953
Start worrying about 
Manbo Construction.

152
00:14:30,227 --> 00:14:34,504
Because the day when I'll 
take it back is not too far off.

153
00:14:34,809 --> 00:14:37,418
It's ludicrous, no doubt...

154
00:14:37,867 --> 00:14:41,006
But I'm glad that verve of yours 
still hasn't died down.

155
00:14:41,101 --> 00:14:43,824
Don't take my words lightly.

156
00:14:44,752 --> 00:14:47,911
Or you'll one day regret it dearly.

157
00:14:56,537 --> 00:14:58,131
Here are all the bill 
collections for this month.

158
00:14:58,232 --> 00:15:00,667
I've already wired all the money.

159
00:15:02,479 --> 00:15:04,667
Do you have time tomorrow?

160
00:15:05,783 --> 00:15:08,712
Baekpa would like to see you.

161
00:15:09,001 --> 00:15:11,051
Did he mention why?

162
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,457
You'll find out when you meet him.

163
00:15:23,748 --> 00:15:28,759
What separates the living from the dead...

164
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,419
is the fact that they still have dreams.

165
00:15:32,506 --> 00:15:35,150
If you have no dreams 
despite being alive,

166
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:38,028
you're no different from a corpse.

167
00:15:39,782 --> 00:15:42,801
So what is your dream?

168
00:15:43,086 --> 00:15:46,450
I want all the money in this world.

169
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:48,717
And what would you do with it?

170
00:15:49,009 --> 00:15:52,491
I'll buy the dreams I
haven't been able to fulfill.

171
00:15:54,227 --> 00:15:56,466
So I see that collecting interests...

172
00:15:56,621 --> 00:15:59,554
wasn't a complete waste of time.

173
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:14,219
Inside that account 
are 400 million won.

174
00:16:15,525 --> 00:16:21,068
Take this money and
buy that dream of yours.

175
00:16:21,716 --> 00:16:23,527
Sir...

176
00:16:25,281 --> 00:16:29,586
I won't set any 
deadline or interest rate.

177
00:16:29,774 --> 00:16:31,122
Instead,

178
00:16:31,238 --> 00:16:35,608
if you end up losing that money,

179
00:16:35,898 --> 00:16:39,768
you'll have to leave 
this business for good.

180
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,377
What I mean is that you will 
never get another chance to dream.

181
00:16:45,739 --> 00:16:47,416
Yes, Sir.

182
00:16:47,637 --> 00:16:52,159
I will use this money to succeed.

183
00:16:52,826 --> 00:16:55,290
You may go now.

184
00:17:09,577 --> 00:17:11,424
Thank you, Sir.

185
00:17:11,577 --> 00:17:16,029
It won't be easy for her.

186
00:17:16,273 --> 00:17:19,208
If she can endure this trade,
she'll attain great success,

187
00:17:19,322 --> 00:17:25,032
but if she can't, she will lose 
all happiness along with that money.

188
00:17:39,717 --> 00:17:41,905
I'll make it.

189
00:17:42,325 --> 00:17:44,804
I'll succeed,

190
00:17:45,949 --> 00:17:48,920
and get back Manbo Construction...

191
00:17:51,065 --> 00:17:54,153
with my own hands.

192
00:17:56,951 --> 00:18:00,560
<i>- Happy Credit -

193
00:18:00,676 --> 00:18:01,875
How about now?

194
00:18:01,984 --> 00:18:05,292
It's slanted.
A little more to the right.

195
00:18:06,473 --> 00:18:07,803
Now?

196
00:18:07,913 --> 00:18:11,022
A little to the left.

197
00:18:11,202 --> 00:18:12,332
<i>Just a little... A little...</i>

198

<i>Ohh... Okay.</i>

199
00:18:22,608 --> 00:18:25,651
I told you we needed a man for this.

200
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:30,612
But shouldn't we 
have an opening ceremony?

201
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:32,930
We still aren't done with the
leaflets, there's plenty to do.

202
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,636
Follow me.

00:18:41,597 --> 00:18:46,194
<i>- Quick and Precise Loans -

- Ohh, Eonni, it will go well.

205
00:19:04,853 --> 00:19:06,927
Come here!

206
00:19:07,085 --> 00:19:09,002
Who was that, Eonni?

207
00:19:21,542 --> 00:19:23,265
<i>What are you two doing here?</i>

208
00:19:23,441 --> 00:19:25,372
Who gave you permission to do this?

209
00:19:25,476 --> 00:19:26,122
Take them off.

210
00:19:26,223 --> 00:19:27,716
Yes, we apologize.

211
00:19:27,803 --> 00:19:29,073
Do it now!

212
00:19:29,156 --> 00:19:30,592
Yes, right away.

213
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,351
- Where are you going?
- I said now!

214
00:19:33,626 --> 00:19:36,249
I said I will, just a moment!

215
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:38,813
Ahh... What do I have to see, really...

216
00:19:38,907 --> 00:19:39,902
Will you take it off or not?

217
00:19:40,018 --> 00:19:41,800
I will, just a moment... 
A moment.

218
00:19:41,902 --> 00:19:44,529
<i>So do it!</i>

219
00:19:45,264 --> 00:19:48,143
What are you waiting for?

220
00:20:03,651 --> 00:20:06,038
I said I'll take them off!

221
00:20:28,938 --> 00:20:30,808
This is serious, Gangmo.

222
00:20:31,068 --> 00:20:33,648
They just announced 
the Suseo concessions,

223
00:20:33,793 --> 00:20:36,858
and they all went 
to committee members!

224
00:20:49,297 --> 00:20:52,065
Who brought this?

225
00:20:52,312 --> 00:20:54,791
I wasn't expecting one from anybody?!

226
00:20:55,071 --> 00:20:56,612
Maybe it's Director Yoo 
of the Royal Club?

227
00:20:56,723 --> 00:21:01,521
All the better... Now this will 
really create that opening atmosphere.

228
00:21:04,536 --> 00:21:06,985
<i>What about us?</i>

229
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:11,453
The only lot left in this 
Suseo project is Area B.

230
00:21:11,873 --> 00:21:14,922
But isn't the entire area
covered by a rock bed?

231
00:21:15,033 --> 00:21:17,933
And you want us to work there?

232
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:21,105
We will accept applications
until the end of the week.

233
00:21:21,381 --> 00:21:22,714
<i>This is excessive.</i>

234
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:25,410
So you leave all the best spots 
to huge corporations,

235
00:21:25,526 --> 00:21:28,463
and are forcing us to take 
a fall and build there instead?

236
00:21:28,562 --> 00:21:33,266
I'm afraid your complaints
will make no difference.

237
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:35,382
Here... You may leave now.

238
00:21:35,483 --> 00:21:36,953
Tell me.

239
00:21:37,106 --> 00:21:39,237
What kind of standards were used 
in choosing the candidates?

240
00:21:40,223 --> 00:21:44,360
I'd like to know in detail what criteria 
were used during your assessment.

241
00:21:44,639 --> 00:21:49,553
Or else, neither I nor these people
will accept this decision.

242
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:51,364
That's natural.

243
00:21:51,483 --> 00:21:53,053
<i>I will be happy to tell you.</i>

244
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:58,499
Citizens from Suseo and the neighboring
area formed a housing cooperative.

245
00:21:59,385 --> 00:22:04,182
Our selection was based upon 
this cooperative's requests.

246
00:22:04,707 --> 00:22:08,573
Is there anything else 
you'd like to say?

247
00:22:17,528 --> 00:22:19,746
<i>- Area B -</i>

248
00:22:32,148 --> 00:22:37,937
Manbo Construction has been
buying land in Suseo for years.

249
00:22:38,134 --> 00:22:41,977
After which they transferred
many of their employees there.

250
00:22:42,178 --> 00:22:45,207
Then, that housing cooperative...

251
00:22:45,337 --> 00:22:47,735
It was formed by
Manbo Construction employees.

252
00:22:48,156 --> 00:22:49,779
Same goes for the
other committee members.

253
00:22:49,851 --> 00:22:53,634
Then, you're suggesting
they plotted this all along?!

254
00:22:53,779 --> 00:22:59,489
They found out before everyone else
that Suseo would be next in line.

255
00:22:59,634 --> 00:23:05,239
The only way to join this project
is applying for the Dolsan area.

256
00:23:05,587 --> 00:23:07,573
As it stands.

257
00:23:10,442 --> 00:23:12,486
<i>Dolsan?!</i>

258
00:23:13,428 --> 00:23:16,892
So you're telling me that Lee Gangmo 
will be forced to choose that,

259
00:23:17,037 --> 00:23:19,545
if he wants to join this Suseo project?

260
00:23:19,802 --> 00:23:22,498
Because it's the only lot left.

261
00:23:22,658 --> 00:23:24,788
It's obvious that they'd
end up deep in the red,

262
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:26,237
will they even bother?

263
00:23:26,368 --> 00:23:31,586
The New City development plan 
will be based on this project's results.

264
00:23:31,774 --> 00:23:35,613
Lee Gangmo will try to join
the construction whatever it takes.

265
00:23:35,721 --> 00:23:39,962
Even if he tears down the entire
Dolsan and builds his apartments,

266
00:23:40,247 --> 00:23:42,477
I will be put in charge
of the New City development.

267
00:23:42,726 --> 00:23:44,456
And that's because I'll make
sure that's what happens.

268
00:23:44,769 --> 00:23:49,001
Look down on your foes and you
might even lose an easy battle.

269
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,615
I will get going.

270
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:03,746
<i>Dolsan is out of the question.</i>

271
00:24:04,383 --> 00:24:05,518
<i>Here.</i>

272
00:24:05,731 --> 00:24:08,512
The entire area is a rock bed.

273
00:24:08,783 --> 00:24:12,740
If you want to build foundations,
you'll first need to get rid of those rocks.

274
00:24:12,856 --> 00:24:15,842
How are you going to pay for that?

275
00:24:16,247 --> 00:24:19,552
Fine, then... Let's suppose we'll run
ourselves dry and deal with that.

276
00:24:19,726 --> 00:24:22,412
What will you do with all those rocks?

277
00:24:22,581 --> 00:24:26,264
If you only count transportation fees,
it'll be enough to build a few apartments!

278
00:24:26,372 --> 00:24:30,166
So to make a long story short,
the game is not worth the candle.

279
00:24:30,413 --> 00:24:33,768
We should just give up 
this Suseo project.

280
00:24:33,906 --> 00:24:35,312
And if we do,

281
00:24:35,471 --> 00:24:38,500
we'll be left out of the
New City concessions as well.

282
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:43,236
Still, we can't just go for it,
when we know it'll bring us great losses.

283
00:24:43,532 --> 00:24:46,402
I think there could be a way...

284
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:47,401
Really?

285
00:24:47,511 --> 00:24:49,023
Like what?

286
00:24:49,134 --> 00:24:53,491
Every time he says that,
I get chills down my spine.

287
00:24:54,141 --> 00:24:55,025
Gyeongja.

288
00:24:55,185 --> 00:24:57,343
Bring me a list of all the companies
excluded from these concessions.

289
00:24:57,488 --> 00:24:59,476
Yes, President.

290
00:25:17,892 --> 00:25:21,444
<i>Are you suggesting we form a
joint construction syndicate?</i>

291
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:25,017
I have a verbal agreement with
Deputy Mayor Han Myeongseok.

292
00:25:25,269 --> 00:25:28,695
He promised that if we form a syndicate,
he will grant us government funding.

293
00:25:28,803 --> 00:25:31,428
And you think that kind
of funding comes free?

294
00:25:31,549 --> 00:25:34,232
That's all money
you'll have to pay back!

295
00:25:34,342 --> 00:25:36,355
If you're really that
confident, do it by yourself.

296
00:25:36,482 --> 00:25:37,992
We can't help you with this.

297
00:25:38,087 --> 00:25:40,513
How much longer are you going 
to let them walk over you?

298
00:25:40,618 --> 00:25:43,875
If we're weaker than them, shouldn't 
we join our forces and fight together?

299
00:25:43,982 --> 00:25:46,434
Think we don't want to fight them?

300
00:25:46,667 --> 00:25:51,697
Just a project gone wrong, 
and anyone of us could be closing up shop.

301
00:25:55,132 --> 00:25:57,794
- Let's just go.
- Right.

302
00:25:58,001 --> 00:25:59,848
Listen to me!

303
00:26:00,117 --> 00:26:02,174
President!

304
00:26:22,861 --> 00:26:24,950
President.

305
00:26:27,369 --> 00:26:28,746
President Lee...

306
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,470
You came all the way here to meet me?

307
00:26:33,015 --> 00:26:34,363
<i>- Inn -</i>

308
00:26:43,726 --> 00:26:46,045
The deadline is tomorrow.

309
00:26:46,258 --> 00:26:47,784
I'm counting on you.

310
00:26:48,024 --> 00:26:51,745
Try to convince the others for me.

311
00:26:54,716 --> 00:26:56,523
When I was your age,

312
00:26:56,631 --> 00:26:58,716
I had just the same
energy and verve as you.

313
00:26:58,818 --> 00:27:00,513
But, have you seen me now?

314
00:27:00,629 --> 00:27:02,966
I'm just a coward.

315
00:27:03,076 --> 00:27:08,662
A coward who fears every last
of the month, when salaries are paid.

316
00:27:08,895 --> 00:27:10,140
Losses?!

317
00:27:10,329 --> 00:27:11,688
That's part of the game.

318
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:13,403
But, you know what?

319
00:27:13,516 --> 00:27:15,778
My company couldn't cope with that now.

320
00:27:15,981 --> 00:27:20,083
Hundreds of lives are
hanging from my pockets...

321
00:27:20,299 --> 00:27:21,938
By any chance,

322
00:27:22,547 --> 00:27:25,666
did you lose your house 
because of that?

323
00:27:26,243 --> 00:27:27,750
Because of me,

324
00:27:27,939 --> 00:27:32,339
my family got separated
and is facing hell.

325
00:27:41,167 --> 00:27:46,332
I guess drinking made me
lose myself in nonsense again...

326
00:27:46,993 --> 00:27:49,631
Get going.

327
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:53,631
Seonbaenim,

328
00:27:55,092 --> 00:27:57,555
you're no coward.

329
00:27:59,237 --> 00:28:01,498
If you truly had been one,

330
00:28:01,701 --> 00:28:06,280
you would have never given up
your house for your employees' sake.

331
00:28:07,367 --> 00:28:12,420
Even if I have to do it alone,
I will join this project.

332
00:28:12,854 --> 00:28:16,893
If only not to betray
my employees' expectations,

333
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:21,579
I will never give up 
on this construction.

334
00:28:24,499 --> 00:28:26,261
Thank you.

335
00:28:26,565 --> 00:28:31,630
You taught me what real courage means.

336
00:28:52,068 --> 00:28:54,459
There are only 10 minutes
left before the deadline!

337
00:28:54,612 --> 00:28:56,172
I don't think they're coming.

338
00:28:56,387 --> 00:28:59,085
But what if he refuses funding
without that syndicate?

339
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:01,995
That was his condition for
giving me government funding.

340
00:29:02,349 --> 00:29:05,074
This won't do it... 
We'll just have to apply by ourselves.

341
00:29:05,242 --> 00:29:07,571
But you said this
construction could fail...

342
00:29:07,749 --> 00:29:10,097
We'll have to give our best to the end.

343
00:29:10,605 --> 00:29:13,109
- President Lee!
- President Lee!

344
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:15,979
Sorry for being late.

345
00:29:16,182 --> 00:29:17,853
Had to convince these gentlemen, so...

346
00:29:18,066 --> 00:29:19,308
So you're all joining in?

347
00:29:19,443 --> 00:29:22,718
You've taught me courage as well!

348
00:29:22,849 --> 00:29:25,917
Let's all join forces.

349
00:29:26,168 --> 00:29:27,559
We have no time to waste!

350
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:28,835
Let's run!

351
00:29:28,931 --> 00:29:30,675
Here...

352
00:29:36,713 --> 00:29:40,249
Here is this month's addition
to the president's account.

353
00:29:47,932 --> 00:29:53,613
I've heard some rumblings
about possible M&A's...

354
00:29:54,236 --> 00:29:57,014
If you know anything
about this, could you...

355
00:29:59,686 --> 00:30:01,710
I don't accept money from anyone.

356
00:30:01,835 --> 00:30:05,033
But I've heard that our
Buseong Group could be in danger.

357
00:30:05,146 --> 00:30:07,918
At the last party 
organized by the president,

358
00:30:08,123 --> 00:30:11,109
I've heard that you
made quite the blunder...

359
00:30:11,239 --> 00:30:13,535
Is it because of that?

360
00:30:13,663 --> 00:30:16,912
If you made any blunder,
couldn't you just make up for it?

361
00:30:17,254 --> 00:30:19,466
Please, help me out.

362
00:30:19,765 --> 00:30:21,631
I'll keep in contact.

363
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:23,925
You may leave.

364
00:30:44,392 --> 00:30:47,065
This month's addition to the
secret fund has just been wired.

365
00:30:47,163 --> 00:30:47,957
You can verify it.

366
00:30:48,073 --> 00:30:49,701
Already did.

367
00:30:49,885 --> 00:30:51,699
Good job.

368
00:30:53,481 --> 00:30:56,867
The higher-ups are
quite satisfied as well.

369
00:30:57,105 --> 00:31:00,638
I think choosing you
was a wise decision.

370
00:31:00,887 --> 00:31:03,409
Whatever it is, just say the word.

371
00:31:06,818 --> 00:31:08,392
Come on in, Minwoo.

372
00:31:08,615 --> 00:31:12,804
Called you so that we could 
all go out for drinks.

373
00:31:17,703 --> 00:31:19,358
I'm a little busy at work,

374
00:31:19,616 --> 00:31:22,036
so I guess you'll
have to go without me.

375
00:31:22,227 --> 00:31:26,351
Minwoo, are you still resenting him?

376
00:31:26,573 --> 00:31:29,659
I'd like to postpone it
to another day as well.

377
00:31:29,892 --> 00:31:32,462
I've got work left to do.

378
00:31:42,673 --> 00:31:45,223
Let's have a word, Hyung.

379
00:31:47,934 --> 00:31:49,861
Miju...

380
00:31:50,383 --> 00:31:53,006
You really don't know where she is?

381
00:31:53,673 --> 00:31:55,875
Told you not to
mention her again, didn't I?

382
00:31:55,974 --> 00:31:57,327
It's been four years.

383
00:31:57,514 --> 00:32:00,059
No matter how hard I try,

384
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,009
four years without leaving
a trace is hard to believe.

385
00:32:06,545 --> 00:32:08,473
Stop looking for her.

386
00:32:08,879 --> 00:32:12,803
You're only going to make life 
worse for the both of you.

387
00:32:13,049 --> 00:32:14,426
No...

388
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:18,390
I'm strong enough to
protect Miju from my father now.

389
00:32:18,673 --> 00:32:20,900
I don't need your help.

390
00:32:21,151 --> 00:32:23,716
I'll just find her on my own.

391
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:44,052
They're so cute...

392
00:32:52,075 --> 00:32:53,895
Come on i...

393
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:55,901
You...

394
00:32:56,017 --> 00:32:57,840
How could you just leave like that?

395
00:32:57,938 --> 00:33:00,310
Do you know how long
we've been looking for you?

396
00:33:02,034 --> 00:33:04,092
I apologize.

397
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:07,962
- If you've lost a lot of money because of me...
- What's your name?

398
00:33:08,165 --> 00:33:09,869
What?

399
00:33:11,557 --> 00:33:13,787
Lee... Miju.

400
00:33:15,252 --> 00:33:16,716
Is this store yours?

401
00:33:16,811 --> 00:33:17,678
No...

402
00:33:17,779 --> 00:33:21,304
There's an owner,
I'm just an employee here.

403
00:33:21,562 --> 00:33:24,126
No other experience on the stage?

404
00:33:24,432 --> 00:33:26,109
None.

405
00:33:26,548 --> 00:33:29,914
You're not seeing anyone, are you?

406
00:33:30,171 --> 00:33:31,059
What?

407
00:33:31,179 --> 00:33:34,677
The director wants to
sign a contract with you.

408
00:33:34,784 --> 00:33:36,938
An exclusive contract.

409
00:33:37,152 --> 00:33:38,906
R...Really?!

410
00:33:39,051 --> 00:33:42,788
If you want to work for me,
your private life needs to be clean.

411
00:33:43,008 --> 00:33:45,910
Can you promise me that much?

412
00:33:49,815 --> 00:33:50,818
Yes...

413
00:33:51,091 --> 00:33:53,751
Then, I'd like to sign it right here...

414
00:33:53,866 --> 00:33:55,018
Here's the contract,

415
00:33:55,105 --> 00:33:58,685
so give it a read and seal it.

416
00:34:20,128 --> 00:34:24,631
<i>You must leave no trace of all this.</i>

417
00:34:26,037 --> 00:34:28,226
If people learn of this,

418
00:34:28,398 --> 00:34:30,313
both you and I will
be as good as dead.

419
00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:32,408
Are we clear?

420
00:34:34,158 --> 00:34:36,385
We are.

421
00:34:36,934 --> 00:34:39,255
The day you die,

422
00:34:40,067 --> 00:34:43,796
I will die as well, Jo Pilyeon.

423
00:35:06,179 --> 00:35:08,210
<i>By building a huge embankment here,</i>

424
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:13,098
the everglades we secured will become
the most expensive land in Suseo.

425
00:35:13,647 --> 00:35:14,730
Nice.

426
00:35:15,023 --> 00:35:19,317
Your business acumen
is improving by the day.

427
00:35:20,154 --> 00:35:23,721
But, from what I hear,

428
00:35:24,096 --> 00:35:27,433
Lee Gangmo chose Dolsan?

429
00:35:27,564 --> 00:35:29,161
It's what I'd hoped for.

430
00:35:29,332 --> 00:35:31,148
Lee Gangmo never disappoints.

431
00:35:31,242 --> 00:35:33,100
It might be a problematic
area to deal with,

432
00:35:33,216 --> 00:35:34,777
but that fella is scary.

433
00:35:35,071 --> 00:35:38,695
He wouldn't make that
kind of choice without a plan.

434
00:35:38,896 --> 00:35:41,392
Dolsan is well under control.

435
00:35:41,608 --> 00:35:43,664
You don't need to worry.

436
00:35:45,301 --> 00:35:46,153
Chairman.

437
00:35:46,258 --> 00:35:47,710
Please, follow me.

438
00:35:47,818 --> 00:35:48,809
What is the matter?

439
00:35:48,925 --> 00:35:53,405
A line of construction machinery
heading for Area B is forming outside.

440
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:58,464
If it's Area B...

441
00:35:59,435 --> 00:36:01,681
Lee Gangmo.

442
00:36:12,232 --> 00:36:14,933
<i>- Suseo Area B Apartment
Joint Construction Syndicate -</i>

443
00:36:35,638 --> 00:36:38,503
How do you do, Congressman Jo?

444
00:36:39,117 --> 00:36:40,827
You spared no expenses, I see.

445
00:36:41,044 --> 00:36:43,545
We need at least this much
to deal with that rock bed.

446
00:36:43,656 --> 00:36:45,436
Aren't you pushing it?

447
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:49,425
It's likely you'll run out of money
before you touch a single brick?!

448
00:36:49,656 --> 00:36:52,172
If I were alone,
I guess you'd be right.

449
00:36:52,424 --> 00:36:55,710
But, can you see that?

450
00:36:59,004 --> 00:37:00,765
So you're all in on this?

451
00:37:00,946 --> 00:37:04,180
Couldn't take a few pompous fools 
acting all important anymore,

452
00:37:04,291 --> 00:37:06,694
so these weaklings
got together for once.

453
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,346
Take a good look.

454
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:13,043
How mere grains of sand can gather
together to make your mountain collapse.

455
00:37:13,403 --> 00:37:15,054
Let's move.

456
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:43,309
And you said you had everything
under control... What is this?

457
00:37:43,396 --> 00:37:46,400
I never imagined all those smaller
enterprises would get together.

458
00:37:46,511 --> 00:37:48,440
You must stop them.

459
00:37:48,648 --> 00:37:51,938
If he manages to succeed here,

460
00:37:52,189 --> 00:37:54,928
Lee Gangmo will get involved with
the New City development as well.

461
00:37:55,131 --> 00:37:58,406
You must stop Hangang Construction
from growing any further.

462
00:38:07,247 --> 00:38:09,396
I see you've been dealing
with quite the loan sharks.

463
00:38:09,553 --> 00:38:16,102
We're trying to pay what is due, but
they don't pick up the phone on purpose.

464
00:38:16,223 --> 00:38:18,093
It's a pretty common trick they use.

465
00:38:18,204 --> 00:38:22,641
If we lose the house...
She's even fallen ill.

466
00:38:22,844 --> 00:38:28,151
We will both end up on a street.

467
00:38:28,759 --> 00:38:32,792
Let's wake up, and start by 
paying your deposit via the court.

468
00:38:33,107 --> 00:38:35,322
Then, your debts will all be cleared.

469
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:37,720
Was there such a way?

470
00:38:37,948 --> 00:38:41,780
But do you have enough
money to pay those debts?

471
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:45,878
Not the principal, just the interest...

472
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:49,936
We'll help you with that,
so start by paying off the interest.

473
00:38:50,151 --> 00:38:51,806
What?

474
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,335
Can you really do that for us?

475
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:58,795
I'm just doing it so that you won't
have to deal with those loan sharks again.

476
00:38:58,921 --> 00:39:01,716
Thank you, Miss.

477
00:39:01,842 --> 00:39:05,305
Our rates will be based
on interest rate-caps,

478
00:39:05,425 --> 00:39:07,887
so don't miss your payments.

479
00:39:08,206 --> 00:39:12,059
Should there be any delays,
expect legal litigation.

480
00:39:12,351 --> 00:39:15,176
We will pay down to the last penny.

481
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:18,591
She will let you in on 
all the other details.

482
00:39:18,901 --> 00:39:21,785
- Yes, yes...
- This way, please.

483
00:39:31,475 --> 00:39:35,361
So they had you write a body forfeit 
contract for a mere million won.

484
00:39:35,472 --> 00:39:36,647
Yes...

485
00:39:36,765 --> 00:39:41,291
As they threatened
to sell off my kidneys...

486
00:39:41,736 --> 00:39:43,614
Let's be clear on this.

487
00:39:43,838 --> 00:39:48,071
Body forfeit contracts
have no legal validity.

488
00:39:50,172 --> 00:39:54,187
A private lender giving legal counsel?!

489
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:57,531
I wonder if she'll be all right...

490
00:39:57,654 --> 00:40:01,392
While offering legal counsel,

491
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:04,958
Jeongyeon is taking customers
away from those loan sharks.

492
00:40:05,174 --> 00:40:09,653
I've never seen anyone in the 
lending business work this way.

493
00:40:10,221 --> 00:40:12,677
But, if she keeps doing that...

494
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:14,050
You just wait.

495
00:40:14,262 --> 00:40:17,814
She'll be just as meticulous
in collecting her interests.

496
00:40:19,165 --> 00:40:23,612
Hearing you say that
does reassure me a little.

497
00:40:23,803 --> 00:40:28,955
I think it's time we put her 
through a little test.

498
00:40:29,238 --> 00:40:32,206
Isn't it too early for that?

499
00:40:33,006 --> 00:40:35,677
Why, does it worry you?

500
00:40:37,242 --> 00:40:43,052
Ohh... Maybe we should use Bucheol?

501
00:40:44,112 --> 00:40:48,920
If she ends up overcoming Bucheol,

502
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:52,771
then she might be ready
for bigger responsibilities.

503
00:40:53,412 --> 00:40:55,825
That's certainly true, but...

504
00:40:55,933 --> 00:40:56,988
I don't think Jeongyeon is ready...

505
00:40:57,075 --> 00:41:02,278
No test will ever 
be as harsh as reality!

506
00:41:02,887 --> 00:41:06,748
If you really have
Jeongyeon's fate at heart...

507
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:12,455
Sir...

508
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:15,099
Are you all right?

509
00:41:16,665 --> 00:41:18,824
I'm fine.

510
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:24,015
Let me listen to the
Heart Sutra and go.

511
00:42:13,662 --> 00:42:18,879
Of all people,
that ruthless loan shark?!

512
00:42:56,856 --> 00:42:59,086
<i>Forty-two...</i>

513
00:42:59,986 --> 00:43:02,981
Forty...three...

514
00:43:04,755 --> 00:43:08,987
Forty...fo...fo...four...

515
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:13,986
Looks like you've been
working out here for long?

516
00:43:14,077 --> 00:43:17,204
Don't really like
women with muscles...

517
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,876
Welcome, Congressman Oh.

518
00:44:30,003 --> 00:44:32,672
If you'll please escort us to where
the committee members are...

519
00:44:32,776 --> 00:44:35,336
- This way, please.
- Let's go.

520
00:44:36,209 --> 00:44:42,263
About that new singer 
we saw last time.

521
00:44:42,486 --> 00:44:44,821
Doesn't she sing here?

522
00:44:45,616 --> 00:44:46,602
Why...

523
00:44:46,711 --> 00:44:50,170
Are you interested as well?

524
00:44:50,616 --> 00:44:54,021
Her performance that night
really left an impression.

525
00:44:54,804 --> 00:44:56,355
A lot of people are
looking for her, actually.

526
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:59,007
I'll bring her here soon.

527
00:45:06,413 --> 00:45:08,846
Let's have a toast.

528
00:45:16,727 --> 00:45:17,817
I apologize for being late.

529
00:45:17,922 --> 00:45:20,967
<i>President Lee, come on in.
Have a seat.</i>

530
00:45:21,094 --> 00:45:24,632
You're really working hard these days.

531
00:45:24,756 --> 00:45:26,783
<i>Let me pour you one.</i>

532
00:45:26,893 --> 00:45:28,484
You know...

533
00:45:29,774 --> 00:45:33,137
I was really touched by what I saw 
at the Dolsan construction site.

534
00:45:33,354 --> 00:45:36,081
If that "turning the impossible
into reality" mentality...

535
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:38,233
is not what our country
needs to survive, what is?

536
00:45:38,329 --> 00:45:40,593
You're flattering me, Sir.

537
00:45:40,701 --> 00:45:42,029
Just in case...

538
00:45:42,145 --> 00:45:47,957
If you manage to deal with that rock bed
and build some solid apartments there,

539
00:45:48,189 --> 00:45:54,870
I'll take full responsibility and 
entrust the New City development to you!

540
00:46:02,115 --> 00:46:08,170
Congressman, making such statements 
in their presence is a little...

541
00:46:08,347 --> 00:46:09,652
A little what?

542
00:46:09,811 --> 00:46:13,851
I always called a spade
a spade, and always will!

543
00:46:14,029 --> 00:46:17,454
And honestly, if he manages to succeed
at something everyone else tried to avoid,

544
00:46:17,570 --> 00:46:20,276
doesn't that itself
vouch for his abilities?

545
00:46:20,401 --> 00:46:22,273
Sure, it sure does!

546
00:46:22,389 --> 00:46:24,988
Doesn't this call for
a toast, Congressman?

547
00:46:25,099 --> 00:46:26,423
Ohh... Shall I?

548
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:27,324
Here...

549
00:46:27,411 --> 00:46:29,860
Let's see those glasses.

550
00:46:30,619 --> 00:46:34,566
To the successful development 
of our Suseo project!

551
00:46:34,783 --> 00:46:37,319
Cheers!

552
00:46:55,936 --> 00:46:57,894
This is my pride and dignity.

553
00:46:58,110 --> 00:47:01,904
With this as collateral,
how much can you give me?

554
00:47:02,026 --> 00:47:02,763
What?

555
00:47:02,850 --> 00:47:07,315
This is the first
of its kind in our country.

556
00:47:07,589 --> 00:47:10,415
Sir, I'm afraid you
misunderstood what we do here...

557
00:47:10,546 --> 00:47:12,858
And it doesn't stop here.

558
00:47:12,977 --> 00:47:14,908
Here.

559
00:47:16,299 --> 00:47:18,271
Take a look at this.

560
00:47:23,526 --> 00:47:29,873
It's used in stonemasonry, and with this 
you can deal with any kind of rock.

561
00:47:30,077 --> 00:47:34,019
We developed this.

562
00:47:34,338 --> 00:47:36,532
Eonni... I'm here.

563
00:47:36,658 --> 00:47:38,217
Will you only pay the interests again?

564
00:47:38,331 --> 00:47:40,528
Even that alone is hard.

565
00:47:40,651 --> 00:47:43,177
Why bother building in that area...

566
00:47:43,289 --> 00:47:47,141
Will you do it or not?

567
00:47:50,604 --> 00:47:57,438
Gyeongja said she's
gaining quite the reputation,

568
00:47:57,609 --> 00:48:01,786
and I guess she's 
also making good money.

569
00:48:02,801 --> 00:48:04,787
<i>Gangmo.</i>

570
00:48:05,134 --> 00:48:11,660
Can't you two get back together?

571
00:48:12,399 --> 00:48:16,733
Even Chairman Hwang
asked for forgiveness...

572
00:48:16,994 --> 00:48:18,907
And you forgave him.

573
00:48:19,052 --> 00:48:24,636
That won't change the fact that
he's responsible for my father's death.

574
00:48:24,824 --> 00:48:26,751
Sorry, Gangmo.

575
00:48:27,056 --> 00:48:28,867
It must be so hard for you...

576
00:48:29,075 --> 00:48:31,998
As long as Jeongyeon is doing fine, 
that's enough for me.

577
00:48:37,824 --> 00:48:42,589
With Oh Byeongtak and
Min Honggi supporting him,

578
00:48:42,748 --> 00:48:45,719
stopping Lee Gangmo's
subsidies will be hard.

579
00:48:45,994 --> 00:48:47,618
Is that so?

580
00:48:48,168 --> 00:48:51,308
Then, as bothersome as it might be, 
I'll need to move onto Plan B.

581
00:48:51,574 --> 00:48:54,318
You already had something in mind?

582
00:48:54,439 --> 00:48:57,028
If there's anything in life 
that can easily break,

583
00:48:57,159 --> 00:48:58,640
that's a business partnership.

584
00:48:58,761 --> 00:49:02,231
So you want to go
for the syndicate itself?

585
00:49:02,753 --> 00:49:06,316
Since that was the
condition to receive funding,

586
00:49:06,623 --> 00:49:09,304
even his subsidies will bear the brunt.

587
00:49:09,795 --> 00:49:16,538
So you'll turn his hidden card 
into his own Achilles' heel?!

588
00:49:17,574 --> 00:49:20,835
It's a brilliant plan.

589
00:49:22,878 --> 00:49:24,255
Director Moon.

590
00:49:24,545 --> 00:49:25,908
Yes, Chairman.

591
00:49:26,110 --> 00:49:30,360
Find everything there is to know about 
Lee Gangmo's fellow syndicate members.

592
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:33,492
Everything from company status 
to their personal lives.

593
00:49:33,664 --> 00:49:35,824
Certainly, Chairman.

594
00:49:37,911 --> 00:49:39,950
We barely got started,

595
00:49:40,045 --> 00:49:42,142
aren't we spending too much already?

596
00:49:42,317 --> 00:49:44,245
We'll receive funding by next month.

597
00:49:44,389 --> 00:49:48,153
Still, this is much too expensive.

598
00:49:48,399 --> 00:49:50,777
Let's endure it a little longer.

599
00:49:51,037 --> 00:49:54,618
Our destiny depends
on this construction.

600
00:49:57,762 --> 00:50:00,872
<i>President Maeng Gukhyeon 
of Ogam Construction.</i>

601
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:05,504
<i>As it stands, he's facing the
biggest cash flow crisis of them all.</i>

602
00:50:05,613 --> 00:50:09,137
<i>Even his private residence was
taken by the bank as collateral.</i>

603
00:50:09,267 --> 00:50:14,744
Setting aside Lee Gangmo, 
he's practically the syndicate's leader.

604
00:50:15,005 --> 00:50:16,538
Call him and set up a meeting.

605
00:50:16,730 --> 00:50:18,716
All right, Chairman.

606
00:50:22,151 --> 00:50:24,702
A joint syndicate...

607
00:50:27,658 --> 00:50:31,847
Weaklings are easily pulverized,
just like grains of sand.

608
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:40,985
I see you were already here.

609
00:50:44,304 --> 00:50:47,153
- As we already explained on the phone...
- You'll forgive me,

610
00:50:47,362 --> 00:50:50,996
but I can't break off this partnership.

611
00:50:52,044 --> 00:50:57,636
Of course that doesn't hide the fact
I find your proposal quite alluring,

612
00:50:58,493 --> 00:51:03,550
but President Lee Gangmo 
did a lot for us.

613
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:06,552
What was our proposal again?

614
00:51:07,282 --> 00:51:10,833
To pay back his bank debts 
at zero interest.

615
00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:17,935
We can add all expenses for
your current construction project.

616
00:51:18,833 --> 00:51:22,742
Same goes for all the other members
with the exception of Lee Gangmo.

617
00:51:23,351 --> 00:51:26,452
Would that suffice to convince you?

618
00:51:44,012 --> 00:51:46,852
If you don't think you
can make it, just fold.

619
00:51:47,331 --> 00:51:48,592
Call.

620
00:51:48,794 --> 00:51:50,200
Straight.

621
00:51:50,391 --> 00:51:52,969
5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

622
00:51:54,241 --> 00:51:57,645
Ahh... And of all times,
look when a full house shows up.

623
00:51:57,842 --> 00:51:59,711
Almost makes me feel sorry.

624
00:52:01,030 --> 00:52:03,849
<i>Jeongshik, aren't you losing too much?</i>

625
00:52:03,974 --> 00:52:06,846
<i>Give him a winner's tip...
He's had it hard enough.</i>

626
00:52:06,972 --> 00:52:10,106
If you need any more money, 
feel free to ask.

627
00:52:10,364 --> 00:52:12,121
No need.

628
00:52:12,232 --> 00:52:14,976
You people... Don't even 
dream of going home and wait.

629
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:16,833
If even one of you leaves,
consider yourselves dead!

630
00:52:16,949 --> 00:52:18,848
Is that clear?

631
00:52:22,906 --> 00:52:28,012
So he's still acting as if he's
the heir of Manbo Construction?!

632
00:52:28,374 --> 00:52:29,606
<i>Here... Card.</i>

633
00:52:29,765 --> 00:52:32,787
<i>- Let's have another round.
- Okay!</i>

634
00:52:34,041 --> 00:52:38,331
So it's tomorrow's flight at four?

635
00:52:39,244 --> 00:52:40,650
All right.

636
00:52:40,759 --> 00:52:42,100
Yes...

637
00:52:42,331 --> 00:52:45,533
I will wire the money to your account.

638
00:52:45,659 --> 00:52:49,120
Of course...
Need to keep one's promises.

639
00:52:49,417 --> 00:52:50,837
Yes, thank you.

640
00:52:50,946 --> 00:52:52,692
Yes...

641
00:52:56,417 --> 00:53:01,098
So Hwang Taeseop is coming back?!

642
00:53:08,403 --> 00:53:10,171
<i>Jeongshik...</i>

643
00:53:10,679 --> 00:53:12,491
What are you doing?

644
00:53:12,621 --> 00:53:13,707
Mom...

645
00:53:14,128 --> 00:53:15,344
Give it to me.

646
00:53:15,452 --> 00:53:17,578
The seal... Where's the seal?

647
00:53:17,691 --> 00:53:18,980
<i>You little...</i>

648
00:53:19,093 --> 00:53:21,763
You gamble all day,
and now even steal?!

649
00:53:21,867 --> 00:53:24,220
Mom... This is the last time.
I swear!

650
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:27,727
You said the exact 
same thing last time!

651
00:53:30,524 --> 00:53:31,417
Give it here.

652
00:53:31,523 --> 00:53:34,268
Hey... Hwang Jeongshik!
Are you going to wake up or what?

653
00:53:34,365 --> 00:53:36,515
Ahh... Just back off!

654
00:53:36,638 --> 00:53:37,886
Mom... Sorry...

655
00:53:37,996 --> 00:53:40,789
This time I mean it... I mean it,
it's the last time.

656
00:53:40,905 --> 00:53:43,616
- I'm sorry.
- Jeongshik...

657
00:53:44,659 --> 00:53:45,940
What can I do...

658
00:53:46,042 --> 00:53:48,242
What do I do with him?

659
00:53:48,331 --> 00:53:50,013
This is all my fault.

660
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:51,998
I didn't raise him properly.

661
00:53:52,114 --> 00:53:56,148
Aigoo, what about my boy now?

662
00:54:22,736 --> 00:54:25,286
How have you been?

663
00:54:32,548 --> 00:54:36,595
I'm fully recovered now.

664
00:54:37,377 --> 00:54:40,929
Take a look... I'm just fine.

665
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:44,927
Also...

666
00:54:45,132 --> 00:54:49,389
I didn't call Jeongyeon on purpose.

667
00:54:49,516 --> 00:54:53,782
We have all the time to meet later.

668
00:54:55,623 --> 00:54:58,739
Here... Let's get going.

669
00:55:16,993 --> 00:55:20,616
Taxi! Taxi...

670
00:55:22,923 --> 00:55:26,253
What the hell are they doing?

671
00:55:26,459 --> 00:55:29,546
Who is that wench
to come all the way here?

672
00:55:30,662 --> 00:55:34,083
We might be divorced,
but he's still Jeongshik's father.

673
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:37,992
I have the right to
discuss our children.

674
00:55:45,761 --> 00:55:48,051
That's nice.

675
00:56:05,003 --> 00:56:08,826
Stop making all that noise.

676
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:11,310
All right.

677
00:56:11,781 --> 00:56:14,880
Where are you going to stay?

678
00:56:15,071 --> 00:56:17,107
Ahh... Well...

679
00:56:17,234 --> 00:56:20,883
I didn't have the time to
make any hotel reservation?!

680
00:56:21,404 --> 00:56:23,187
Stay at my apartment
for the time being.

681
00:56:23,288 --> 00:56:25,408
Will be much better
than staying at a hotel.

682
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,511
Shall I?

683
00:56:29,352 --> 00:56:31,796
Let's do that, then.

684
00:56:31,975 --> 00:56:36,048
What are your plans?

685
00:56:39,744 --> 00:56:43,300
You see this?
It's filled with business plans.

686
00:56:43,409 --> 00:56:48,636
I've already secured
investment in the States.

687
00:56:49,305 --> 00:56:50,783
<i>Don't you worry, Gyeongok.</i>

688
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:53,034
I'll soon jump back onto the scene.

689
00:56:53,204 --> 00:57:01,035
I'll start a huge venture that will make
Manbo Construction pale in comparison.

690
00:57:17,036 --> 00:57:19,210
I got it all cleaned in the morning.

691
00:57:19,470 --> 00:57:20,717
I'll get going.

692
00:57:20,847 --> 00:57:22,221
Will you?

693
00:57:22,543 --> 00:57:26,094
Director Ju, shall we unpack?

694
00:57:37,123 --> 00:57:38,338
Have some rest.

695
00:57:38,463 --> 00:57:40,804
I'll come again tomorrow.

696
00:57:49,335 --> 00:57:52,024
Business plans, my ass.

697
00:57:52,128 --> 00:57:55,532
The bank balance is
pretty much done as well.

698
00:57:55,662 --> 00:57:59,538
Jo Pilyeon, you son of a bitch...

699
00:57:59,651 --> 00:58:04,877
I won't find peace until
I kill that rat bastard.

700
00:58:07,699 --> 00:58:10,099
Come on in.

701
00:58:11,264 --> 00:58:13,322
<i>So we meet again?!</i>

702
00:58:15,713 --> 00:58:17,649
Can't you recognize me?

703
00:58:17,931 --> 00:58:21,208
Right... At the Health Club.

704
00:58:21,333 --> 00:58:24,862
So you run this place?

705
00:58:27,207 --> 00:58:29,352
I see you have a lot
of real estate overseas?!

706
00:58:29,497 --> 00:58:32,004
How much were you looking to borrow?

707
00:58:32,874 --> 00:58:34,437
How much can you give me?

708
00:58:34,656 --> 00:58:38,103
We only give small loans here.

709
00:58:38,841 --> 00:58:41,551
I'd like to go for about 500 million?!

710
00:58:43,711 --> 00:58:46,291
I'll introduce you
to some colleagues, then.

711
00:58:47,711 --> 00:58:49,791
Just a hundred, then.

712
00:58:51,523 --> 00:58:54,002
Even that is too much for us.

713
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:55,901
How about fifty?

714
00:58:56,176 --> 00:58:57,570
You can lend me fifty, can't you?

715
00:58:57,696 --> 00:58:58,930
Come back tomorrow.

716
00:58:59,075 --> 00:59:01,891
After we're done examining your
documents, we'll give it a try.

717
00:59:02,133 --> 00:59:02,901
Yes.

718
00:59:03,046 --> 00:59:05,984
Check it, everything is in order.

719
00:59:14,619 --> 00:59:18,521
He has a lot of real estate,
judging by those documents...

720
00:59:18,764 --> 00:59:22,880
Check them thoroughly.
I have a bad feeling about him.

721
00:59:39,593 --> 00:59:44,522
At first glance, all she's got is
probably two to three hundred million.

722
00:59:45,986 --> 00:59:48,768
It's kind of disappointing,

723
00:59:49,348 --> 00:59:52,232
but that Hwang Jeongyeon 
is really something?!

724
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:58,505
Well done!

725
00:59:58,614 --> 01:00:00,733
Great job.

726
01:00:01,646 --> 01:00:07,139
It's about time someone shows him
that everyone should know his place.

727
01:00:08,182 --> 01:00:10,125
Any good news, Sir?

728
01:00:10,241 --> 01:00:13,769
Lee Gangmo is about to go bust.

729
01:00:14,095 --> 01:00:18,581
Then, did Minwoo manage to
create a rift in the syndicate?

730
01:00:18,799 --> 01:00:20,005
He did.

731
01:00:20,109 --> 01:00:22,798
And with no partnership,
his funding will soon run dry.

732
01:00:22,902 --> 01:00:26,772
How is he going to dispose of
all that rock and build apartments?

733
01:00:28,857 --> 01:00:30,554
Being reckless is a sin.

734
01:00:30,714 --> 01:00:33,540
He deserves to be punished for it.

735
01:00:48,099 --> 01:00:50,722
Why did your employees leave the site?

736
01:00:51,345 --> 01:00:55,766
We decided to abandon this project.

737
01:00:56,157 --> 01:00:57,223
You did what?

738
01:00:57,375 --> 01:01:00,476
We can't face any more losses.

739
01:01:00,578 --> 01:01:03,264
What's that supposed
to mean? You leave now?

740
01:01:03,444 --> 01:01:05,342
What do you suppose we do?

741
01:01:05,473 --> 01:01:07,991
Deal with that rock bed 
all by ourselves?

742
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:13,622
Instead, we'll pay for all
construction costs up to this point.

743
01:01:13,821 --> 01:01:17,088
Does that make any sense?

744
01:01:17,372 --> 01:01:20,344
I'm sorry, President Lee.

745
01:01:23,947 --> 01:01:26,966
We'll soon receive government funding.

746
01:01:27,121 --> 01:01:28,222
President Lee...

747
01:01:28,367 --> 01:01:33,846
Can't you... Can't you
endure it just a little longer?

748
01:01:50,823 --> 01:01:52,244
Gangmo...

749
01:01:52,403 --> 01:01:56,345
Are you going to 
let them leave like that?

750
01:02:00,230 --> 01:02:02,951
Won't make any difference.

751
01:02:03,346 --> 01:02:07,939
They were bought off, by Jo Minwoo.

752
01:02:08,276 --> 01:02:09,142
What?

753
01:02:09,363 --> 01:02:12,417
It was all a scheme by him.

754
01:02:13,059 --> 01:02:15,972
Jo Minwoo?!

755
01:02:19,204 --> 01:02:20,900
- Gangmo!
- Let go!

756
01:02:21,045 --> 01:02:23,377
- You've lost all reason!
- You bet I did.

757
01:02:23,551 --> 01:02:26,508
There's no stopping me now.

758
01:02:26,914 --> 01:02:27,579
Gangmo...

759
01:02:27,672 --> 01:02:31,619
That's the piece of shit 
who ruined our Miju!

760
01:02:31,842 --> 01:02:36,045
And now he's trying to ruin me as well!

761
01:02:40,207 --> 01:02:43,243
And in conclusion, you've become 
chairman at such a young age,

762
01:02:43,350 --> 01:02:45,540
can you tell us your future aspirations?

763
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:51,990
I have a keen interest in the
social role corporations can play.

764
01:02:52,454 --> 01:02:55,091
Profits are certainly important,

765
01:02:55,294 --> 01:02:59,886
but they always pale in comparison 
with the contribution your...

766
01:03:09,850 --> 01:03:14,533
What is President Lee Gangmo of
Hangang Construction doing here?

767
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:18,359
There's a limit to my patience!

768
01:03:20,403 --> 01:03:22,446
So, what?

769
01:03:22,742 --> 01:03:24,128
Are you gonna hit me?

770
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:26,299
Think I couldn't?

771
01:03:31,797 --> 01:03:34,712
If you want your face on
every major newspaper's front page...

772
01:03:34,817 --> 01:03:36,840
Be my guest.

773
01:03:37,449 --> 01:03:40,089
You don't have the guts to do that.

774
01:03:40,217 --> 01:03:42,071
<i>Know why?</i>

775
01:03:42,218 --> 01:03:47,322
Because you can act tough all you want, 
but you still remain a weakling.

776
01:03:49,728 --> 01:03:52,264
A joint syndicate?!

777
01:03:53,018 --> 01:03:57,438
Know why you were swept away 
like leaves under the autumn wind?

778
01:03:57,786 --> 01:04:00,265
<i>Because you're weak.</i>

779
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:02,870
And a bunch of cowards.

780
01:04:09,044 --> 01:04:12,073
So that's why you'll never make it.

781
01:04:15,610 --> 01:04:18,573
You'll only be bait for the big fish.

782
01:04:25,211 --> 01:04:26,729
Gangmo...

783
01:04:27,962 --> 01:04:29,241
Weakling?

784
01:04:29,353 --> 01:04:31,284
Coward?!

785
01:04:31,646 --> 01:04:33,264
<i>I told you, didn't I?</i>

786
01:04:33,358 --> 01:04:34,760
That any time I see pompous fools 
trying to act like big fish,

787
01:04:34,832 --> 01:04:38,311
I get the urge to devour them!
