00:00:17,177 --> 00:00:19,345
<i>I can't live like that.</i>

6
00:00:19,514 --> 00:00:21,899
<i>I'll get revenge my own way.</i>

7
00:00:22,753 --> 00:00:24,323
And what's your way?

8
00:00:24,495 --> 00:00:27,047
Destroying Manbo Construction.

9
00:00:28,184 --> 00:00:30,340
When I'm done with them,

10
00:00:31,179 --> 00:00:32,941
they'll face a miserable,

11
00:00:34,111 --> 00:00:36,231
pitiful downfall.

12
00:00:44,581 --> 00:00:47,282
Is anything the matter?

13
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:52,617
Everyone tells me I make them
feel happier when they drink with me.

14
00:00:53,097 --> 00:00:54,770
Pretty lady.

15
00:00:54,863 --> 00:00:56,643
Go get us some more ice.

16
00:00:56,754 --> 00:00:58,262
Ice?

17
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:00,465
There's plenty here?!

18
00:01:02,593 --> 00:01:04,618
All right.

19
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:14,706
I shouldn't have told Gangmo.

20
00:01:14,817 --> 00:01:17,563
You had no choice.

21
00:01:18,357 --> 00:01:20,171
Don't you know yourself?

22
00:01:21,244 --> 00:01:28,268
How living with a grudge
can destroy you inside,

23
00:01:29,647 --> 00:01:34,800
the loneliness and sorrow 
it subjects you to.

24
00:01:36,545 --> 00:01:44,594
I wanted to bear that
painful fate all by myself.

25
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,595
Gangmo.

26
00:02:15,821 --> 00:02:18,010
You've had it hard.

27
00:02:20,212 --> 00:02:26,151
This gentleman here is the lawyer
who will be representing you in court.

28
00:02:28,461 --> 00:02:30,589
You're a first-time offender,

29
00:02:30,722 --> 00:02:34,532
and, considering the situation, 
it could be ruled as manslaughter,

30
00:02:34,883 --> 00:02:37,762
<i>so we could get you out in four years...</i>

31
00:02:37,851 --> 00:02:43,810
No, even much less than that.

32
00:02:46,774 --> 00:02:51,504
I'd like a word in private 
with the chairman.

33
00:02:52,326 --> 00:02:54,020
I'll leave you two alone,

34
00:02:54,182 --> 00:02:56,430
so you can discuss.

35
00:03:03,119 --> 00:03:08,489
I've heard everything from Jeongyeon.

36
00:03:10,533 --> 00:03:12,656
I'm sorry, Gangmo.

37
00:03:12,802 --> 00:03:20,095
I couldn't possibly find
any excuse for what I did.

38
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,143
Gangmo.

39
00:03:23,531 --> 00:03:28,076
Tell me anything you wish.

40
00:03:28,414 --> 00:03:33,567
Whatever it is, I'll do it for you.

41
00:03:35,103 --> 00:03:42,085
That is the only way
I can make up for all I did.

42
00:03:44,169 --> 00:03:48,209
The mudflats you bought in
Gaepo-Dong under company name.

43
00:03:49,165 --> 00:03:51,801
Transfer possession to me.

44
00:03:56,071 --> 00:03:59,591
Was my request excessive?

45
00:04:01,187 --> 00:04:02,844
No...

46
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,205
It's not.

47
00:04:06,475 --> 00:04:08,326
I'll do that.

48
00:04:09,059 --> 00:04:13,950
I'll register that land in your name.

49
00:04:15,571 --> 00:04:18,502
I'll get going, then.

50
00:04:19,857 --> 00:04:21,696
Gangmo!

51
00:04:24,236 --> 00:04:31,590
I hope you won't resent me.

52
00:04:33,355 --> 00:04:42,161
I never, ever thought 
of you as a stranger.

53
00:04:45,682 --> 00:04:48,706
Tell Jeongyeon.

54
00:04:51,077 --> 00:04:53,351
That Lee Gangmo...

55
00:04:54,246 --> 00:04:59,960
was ruthless enough to
prefer that land over her.

56
00:05:01,013 --> 00:05:03,129
What's that supposed to mean?

57
00:05:03,891 --> 00:05:05,960
Are you telling me you two...

58
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:44,115
<i>Case file No. 1327.</i>

59
00:05:44,212 --> 00:05:49,256
<i>The defendant Lee Gangmo is hereby 
sentenced to four years in prison.</i>

60
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:05,879
He's a newcomer 
who just joined us today.

61
00:06:05,963 --> 00:06:08,006
Don't cause a commotion 
and try to get along.

62
00:06:08,086 --> 00:06:09,739
Yes!

63
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:12,679
You sure are shit out of luck.

64
00:06:12,987 --> 00:06:16,295
Of all the cells they 
could send you to, this one.

65
00:06:17,102 --> 00:06:20,771
<i>Aigoo... Looks promising.</i>

66
00:06:20,882 --> 00:06:23,169
But let's skim the grease off a little.

67
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,022
Sure, Hyungnim.

68
00:06:31,203 --> 00:06:37,024
The judge called me a murderer.

69
00:06:37,523 --> 00:06:39,412
What?

70
00:06:43,222 --> 00:06:47,712
And so what, are you trying
to intimidate us with that?

71
00:06:49,706 --> 00:06:51,498
Just a piece of advice,

72
00:06:52,143 --> 00:06:54,002
don't mess with me.

73
00:06:54,327 --> 00:06:57,788
Because, no matter whom, I'm not 
going to let anyone step over me again.

74
00:06:57,897 --> 00:07:00,001
You little asswipe...

75
00:07:06,784 --> 00:07:08,901
Stop him!

76
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,850
Let me go, you pricks!

77
00:07:20,722 --> 00:07:22,159
I told you not to 
mess with me, didn't I?

78
00:07:22,232 --> 00:07:24,639
<i>I told you!</i>

79
00:08:00,872 --> 00:08:07,702
<i>{\a6}- Shim Subong's "That Man, Back Then" -</i>

80
00:08:00,872 --> 00:08:07,702
<i>The man I recall on every rainfall.</i>

81
00:08:08,706 --> 00:08:14,367
He who never was 
a man of many words,

82
00:08:15,963 --> 00:08:22,912
Hiding the thorns of love 
behind a shadow,

83
00:08:23,614 --> 00:08:30,436
Crying in solitude for
the love who abandoned him.

84
00:08:31,549 --> 00:08:37,457
<i>One day, he asked me inside that car.</i>

85
00:08:38,522 --> 00:08:43,310
<i>{\a6}October 26, 1979</i>

<i>~ KCIA President Kim Jaegyu Assassinates
President Park Jeonghee ~</i>

86

<i>{\a6}Jeon Duhwan announces results

87
00:08:43,433 --> 00:08:56,014
<i>- The KCIA is no longer allowed
to hide its budget details -</i>

88
00:08:56,167 --> 00:09:00,172
- Turn that off.
- Yes.

89
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,573
What is this lightning on a sunny day?

90
00:09:03,695 --> 00:09:06,196
Kim Jaegyu kills the president?!

91
00:09:06,341 --> 00:09:09,407
It's no lightning,
but only a roll of thunder.

92
00:09:09,514 --> 00:09:11,534
And what is that supposed to mean?

93
00:09:11,631 --> 00:09:14,010
Ipoyeokpo.

94
00:09:14,104 --> 00:09:16,970
Violence bears more violence.

95
00:09:17,069 --> 00:09:19,396
<i>{\a6}*Borne out of the Hanahwe (Group of One)
which led to Jeon Duhwan's coup d'etat</i>

96
00:09:17,069 --> 00:09:19,396
The New Military Regime*
will soon gain power,

97
00:09:19,493 --> 00:09:23,097
so the real lightning
will begin to strike now.

98
00:09:23,218 --> 00:09:27,977
All public servants are frantically
trying to appease them as well.

99
00:09:28,093 --> 00:09:32,462
Whomever gains power, it won't affect 
the South Seoul redevelopment plan,

100
00:09:32,587 --> 00:09:36,137
so you can rest assured.

101
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:41,253
I've heard the KCIA top brass was
questioned by the joint investigation team.

102
00:09:41,689 --> 00:09:45,771
<i>Aren't Jo Pilyeon 
and Min Honggi lucky?</i>

103
00:09:45,886 --> 00:09:50,889
They barely escaped the tide when they 
resigned because of the by-elections.

104
00:09:50,994 --> 00:09:52,978
I'm the problem now.

105
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:57,524
Officially, they flaunt this as
some kind of "war on corruption,"

106
00:09:57,828 --> 00:10:00,028
but in reality it's nothing
but a purge, what else?!

107
00:10:00,234 --> 00:10:04,287
Aren't you on good terms with them?

108
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,019
You even came to my club together, 
from time to time.

109
00:10:07,091 --> 00:10:13,381
I might have handed them a few "envelopes"
during their meetings there, but...

110
00:10:13,695 --> 00:10:16,938
An era of bloodshed has just ended,

111
00:10:17,047 --> 00:10:20,611
so those who bore the brunt
will not just take this lying down.

112
00:10:21,061 --> 00:10:24,801
Pandemonium will soon break out.

113
00:10:27,347 --> 00:10:37,442
<i>{\a6}Student protesters rage on the street
against Jeon Duhwan's dictatorship</i>

114
00:10:27,347 --> 00:10:37,442
<i>- May, 1980 -

<i>{\a6}- September, 1980 -</i>

<i>Running solo, Jeon Duhwan is

<i>- 1981 -</i>

118
00:11:38,761 --> 00:11:42,051
Hyungnim. The newspaper.

<i>- Manbo Construction Completes Subway -</i>

120
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:04,774
I was the first to ask the 
chairman to give me that land.

121
00:12:05,803 --> 00:12:08,281
On the condition that I
would no longer marry you.

122
00:12:09,418 --> 00:12:11,601
It's what I got in return 
for giving up on you.

123
00:12:11,686 --> 00:12:16,406
Even if that is the truth,
I'll still wait for you.

124
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,697
I'll wait, and then we'll
get married and live happily.

125
00:12:20,842 --> 00:12:25,299
You and I were not made for
each other from the very start.

126
00:12:25,454 --> 00:12:26,778
Gangmo...

127
00:12:26,887 --> 00:12:32,363
Do you know that the more I look at you, 
the more miserable I feel?

128
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:39,456
If I had never met you,
my life would have been simple,

129
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:41,972
<i>but at least I would have been happy.</i>

130
00:12:43,447 --> 00:12:45,794
Think acting like this 
will make me give up?

131
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:47,741
Don't wait for me.

132
00:12:48,593 --> 00:12:51,165
<i>Don't come visit me again, either.</i>

133
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:57,321
I only came here to tell you this.

134
00:12:59,849 --> 00:13:01,252
Let's go back.

135
00:13:01,398 --> 00:13:04,818
Wait... wait, Gangmo!
Let's talk a little longer, Gangmo!

136
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:09,470
Gangmo! Gangmo...

137
00:13:09,746 --> 00:13:11,780
Gangmo!

138
00:13:22,605 --> 00:13:25,328
Gangmo...

139
00:13:28,594 --> 00:13:31,195
Gangmo...

140
00:13:50,019 --> 00:13:51,931
Lee Gangmo.

141
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,108
<i>A visit for you.</i>

142
00:13:54,362 --> 00:13:58,567
It's that young lady again,
must you really send her back all the time?

143
00:13:58,752 --> 00:14:02,921
<i>Just meet her for a change,
how many times has this been already?</i>

144
00:14:11,678 --> 00:14:12,916
What can I tell you...

145
00:14:13,004 --> 00:14:16,109
Lee Gangmo refused to meet you again?

146
00:14:18,492 --> 00:14:20,343
Wait.

147
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:26,456
Give this to him.

148
00:14:26,719 --> 00:14:28,633
All right.

149
00:14:34,802 --> 00:14:36,508
<i>Gangmo.</i>

150
00:14:37,299 --> 00:14:41,687
<i>Are you really bent on avoiding me?</i>

151
00:14:45,944 --> 00:14:48,170
Letters.

152
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,279
Sit down.

153
00:14:52,661 --> 00:14:55,394
Hyungnim, it's a letter.

154
00:15:24,851 --> 00:15:29,074
To all the ladies and gentlemen...

155
00:15:29,204 --> 00:15:33,894
gathered here today to support
Candidate No. 4 Jo Pilyeon,

156
00:15:34,003 --> 00:15:38,578
I extend you my deepest, 
humblest gratitude.

157
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,279
Once these elections are over,

158
00:15:45,473 --> 00:15:53,696
the same applause you're hearing
will be the sound heralding our triumph!

159
00:15:53,985 --> 00:15:56,592
Jo Pilyeon! Jo Pilyeon!

160
00:15:56,698 --> 00:16:00,007
Candidate No. 4 Jo Pilyeon!

161
00:16:11,709 --> 00:16:12,985
Thank you.

162
00:16:13,118 --> 00:16:15,532
- Congratulations.
- I appreciate it.

163
00:16:15,637 --> 00:16:18,806
Aigoo... 
Stop stuffing yourself, you brat!

164
00:16:18,997 --> 00:16:21,103
Ever bought me meat before?

165
00:16:21,191 --> 00:16:24,003
Now that I get the chance,
why not take advantage of it?

166
00:16:24,767 --> 00:16:26,855
Are you done with this?

167
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:36,403
I haven't seen Jeongyeon around?!

168
00:16:36,616 --> 00:16:41,176
These days she's completely 
obsessed with work...

169
00:16:41,479 --> 00:16:45,132
Be that as it may, how could
she miss such an occasion?

170
00:16:45,228 --> 00:16:50,901
Tell me about it... I was so adamant
she should have come, but no use.

171
00:16:51,131 --> 00:16:53,816
Anyhow, she's really something.

172
00:16:53,998 --> 00:16:57,124
Postponing this marriage all by herself.

173
00:16:59,265 --> 00:17:05,748
Isn't it time you tell your father
that you broke off the engagement?

174
00:17:05,878 --> 00:17:10,073
When the elections are over,
I'll tell him firsthand.

175
00:17:10,726 --> 00:17:16,245
You still have feelings for Jeongyeon?

176
00:17:16,352 --> 00:17:18,660
I'll be honest with you.

177
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:26,242
Never in my life have I 
given up on something I desired.

178
00:17:26,965 --> 00:17:29,036
<i>Here you are!</i>

179
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:35,353
Do you have something for me?

180
00:17:36,103 --> 00:17:37,513
Bring it.

181
00:17:37,605 --> 00:17:39,599
All right, Chairman.

182
00:17:42,042 --> 00:17:45,385
Let's leave the hall, shall we?

183
00:17:52,493 --> 00:17:54,685
Thank you, Chairman Hwang.

184
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,804
I wish you the best of luck.

185
00:17:56,901 --> 00:17:59,098
If you'll excuse me.

186
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:05,184
I'll let you in on 
a shocking development.

187
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:12,910
The City Council will soon announce 
the new expansion areas to be redeveloped.

188
00:18:14,389 --> 00:18:16,683
And where would that be?

189
00:18:17,022 --> 00:18:18,860
Gaepo.

190
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,651
What?

191
00:18:21,421 --> 00:18:23,832
Gae...Gaepo?!

192
00:18:24,037 --> 00:18:32,610
I'm aware you bought vast mudflats 
in Gaepo under your company's name?!

193
00:18:34,382 --> 00:18:36,753
It will soon be officially announced.

194
00:18:36,898 --> 00:18:40,515
- We should begin preparations for...
- That land...

195
00:18:40,795 --> 00:18:42,766
doesn't belong to me.

196
00:18:43,556 --> 00:18:46,259
I gave it to Lee Gangmo.

197
00:18:51,185 --> 00:18:52,854
Chairman.

198
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,848
What on earth are you saying?

199
00:18:58,295 --> 00:19:02,202
One thing led to the other,
and that's how it went.

200
00:19:02,387 --> 00:19:09,084
So, what, are you telling me 
you'll just give up on it like that?

201
00:19:11,088 --> 00:19:15,224
I only promised you campaign funding.

202
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:18,393
I never put you in charge 
of managing my assets.

203
00:19:18,647 --> 00:19:20,365
Say what?

204
00:19:21,773 --> 00:19:25,207
If you'll excuse me, I'll get going.

205
00:19:30,349 --> 00:19:32,744
What on earth...

206
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:38,174
What did he just do?

207
00:19:41,153 --> 00:19:43,100
Chairman.

208
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:50,465
You must get your hands 
on that land again.

209
00:19:51,674 --> 00:19:53,730
I bought it with my own money.

210
00:19:53,827 --> 00:19:55,695
You bought it under company name.

211
00:19:55,798 --> 00:19:58,823
Shouldn't you invest in it
for the company's sake?

212
00:19:59,106 --> 00:20:01,943
If we turn those mudflats 
into a housing lot,

213
00:20:02,016 --> 00:20:04,526
we'll have a goldmine in our hands.

214
00:20:04,628 --> 00:20:06,733
We can't let Lee Gangmo
gain control of that land.

215
00:20:06,813 --> 00:20:08,787
It's all over already.

216
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:13,480
That land belongs to Lee Gangmo.

217
00:20:13,589 --> 00:20:14,995
I will get it back.

218
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,129
We must!

219
00:20:16,226 --> 00:20:17,694
There's no need.

220
00:20:17,797 --> 00:20:24,839
Since when Gangmo is released,
he'll come back to work for the company.

221
00:20:27,548 --> 00:20:29,889
So you plan to welcome Lee Gangmo...

222
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:33,013
back into the company?

223
00:20:33,114 --> 00:20:38,282
I never kicked him out to begin with.

224
00:20:38,912 --> 00:20:44,133
When Gangmo comes back, 
so will that land.

225
00:20:44,629 --> 00:20:50,846
So let's not argue 
about that any longer.

226
00:21:05,136 --> 00:21:06,402
Listen, Hyungnim.

227
00:21:06,511 --> 00:21:08,910
Someone is looking for you.

228
00:21:12,048 --> 00:21:15,216
They call them the "Wild Beasts,"
and they're active in the Yeongdeung-Po area.

229
00:21:15,325 --> 00:21:16,704
I hear they really have a nasty temper.

230
00:21:16,789 --> 00:21:20,631
So just nod and beg.

231
00:21:20,723 --> 00:21:21,869
Uh?

232
00:21:30,925 --> 00:21:33,146
Got some cement around
your neck or something?

233
00:21:33,436 --> 00:21:35,681
Pay your respects.

234
00:21:38,258 --> 00:21:40,532
You little prick...

235
00:21:50,172 --> 00:21:52,526
Looks like quite the difficult book.

236
00:21:54,199 --> 00:21:56,269
You're Lee Gangmo, right?

237
00:21:57,029 --> 00:21:58,078
And?

238
00:21:58,193 --> 00:22:01,928
I've heard you're quite
the fierce little bastard.

239
00:22:07,907 --> 00:22:09,891
Come under me.

240
00:22:10,387 --> 00:22:12,649
I've got plenty of 
meaty folks working for me,

241
00:22:12,794 --> 00:22:16,048
but you know, none of them really seems
to know how to use the gray matter above.

242
00:22:16,181 --> 00:22:20,016
So what, you want me 
to become a street thug?

243
00:22:20,127 --> 00:22:21,614
Street thug?!

244
00:22:22,197 --> 00:22:25,352
Tell you what, I'll give you this book, 
so why don't you study it?

245
00:22:25,472 --> 00:22:27,130
You really...

246
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:35,221
Are you banking 
on those prison guards?

247
00:22:36,709 --> 00:22:38,265
Hold him.

248
00:22:48,972 --> 00:22:51,766
You know, these days 
I'm getting a little rusty.

249
00:22:51,947 --> 00:22:54,801
<i>So whenever I show up,
keep acting all defiant.</i>

250
00:22:54,947 --> 00:22:56,822
Got it?

251
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:06,688
What is going on here?

252
00:23:10,595 --> 00:23:13,505
He got a little out of line,
so I taught him a lesson.

253
00:23:13,639 --> 00:23:15,417
You little...

254
00:23:16,651 --> 00:23:18,733
- Take him.
- Yes.

255
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,712
You fools, screw up
and it's solitary confinement.

256
00:23:23,821 --> 00:23:25,261
Got it?

257
00:23:30,425 --> 00:23:31,913
Saw that?

258
00:23:32,409 --> 00:23:36,304
<i>There is nothing I can't do here, 
if I really want to.</i>

259
00:23:36,514 --> 00:23:39,245
I wear the crown around here.

260
00:23:49,757 --> 00:23:51,722
Hyungnim, what now?

261
00:23:51,855 --> 00:23:55,061
You're on that beast's bad side now.

262
00:24:10,901 --> 00:24:14,063
You. 
Come here.

263
00:24:14,874 --> 00:24:17,220
Come wash my hair, will you?

264
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:19,843
Why is it so damn hot?

265
00:24:19,976 --> 00:24:21,888
<i>Go ahead.</i>

266
00:24:29,324 --> 00:24:33,159
Take good care of him.

267
00:24:34,394 --> 00:24:37,029
Give it your best shot.

268
00:24:42,122 --> 00:24:46,046
Is that all you can do?

269
00:25:03,083 --> 00:25:07,746
Why? Afraid of dying now,
you sorry ass thug?

270
00:25:09,681 --> 00:25:14,779
Just like you, there's nothing
I can't do inside here if I want to.

271
00:25:16,704 --> 00:25:18,467
I beg you... Stop it...

272
00:25:18,564 --> 00:25:23,088
<i>If you really want to mess with me,
you better go all the way and kill me.</i>

273
00:25:24,031 --> 00:25:31,062
Or I'll embarrass you so bad, you won't
have the guts to prance around anymore.

274
00:25:33,785 --> 00:25:36,299
Don't kill me...

275
00:25:37,622 --> 00:25:41,478
Hyungnim, are you still here?

276
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:48,206
I'll get going then, Hyungnim.

277
00:25:55,828 --> 00:25:59,057
Hyungnim, are you all right?

278
00:26:18,709 --> 00:26:20,562
Must be tough in there.

279
00:26:21,057 --> 00:26:24,028
So tell me, are you managing okay?

280
00:26:24,275 --> 00:26:25,593
More or less.

281
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,605
Was it still about 
two years before release?!

282
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:32,016
I've long lost track of time.

283
00:26:34,318 --> 00:26:35,879
You...

284
00:26:37,778 --> 00:26:40,318
got some land from the chairman, right?

285
00:26:40,814 --> 00:26:41,890
And?

286
00:26:42,471 --> 00:26:43,777
Sell it to me.

287
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:46,733
I'll pay you well above market value.

288
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:50,444
And how much would that be?

289
00:26:50,536 --> 00:26:53,146
How much were you being paid 
at Goods & Services?

290
00:26:53,642 --> 00:26:55,844
Just a quick calculation,

291
00:26:56,497 --> 00:27:00,273
and it would be the kind of sum you wouldn't 
see even after a lifetime spent there.

292
00:27:00,674 --> 00:27:02,692
You've had it so hard all this time,

293
00:27:02,849 --> 00:27:05,583
shouldn't you live a normal,
decent life when you're out?

294
00:27:06,029 --> 00:27:07,796
That land...

295
00:27:08,679 --> 00:27:11,860
is what I got in exchange
for not marrying Jeongyeon.

296
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,550
<i>Do you know why...</i>

297
00:27:14,779 --> 00:27:18,783
I chose that useless lot of mudflats?

298
00:27:20,158 --> 00:27:23,851
By prancing around with 2x4s
dealing with this and that land,

299
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:27,152
I guess I started getting the hang of it.

300
00:27:28,059 --> 00:27:31,724
You'll pay me above market value?!

301
00:27:36,285 --> 00:27:38,559
Listen well, Jo Minwoo.

302
00:27:39,876 --> 00:27:44,024
Do I still look like the poor little servant
you always showed contempt for?

303
00:27:45,306 --> 00:27:48,984
There is but one thing I learned
by doing the chairman's dirty work.

304
00:27:50,242 --> 00:27:55,451
That the power to rule
this world comes from money.

305
00:27:56,181 --> 00:27:58,443
<i>It's with money that you
take away other people's property,</i>

306
00:27:58,757 --> 00:28:01,212
and use it to make more money.

307
00:28:03,863 --> 00:28:05,922
Isn't this world filthy?

308
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:11,616
So?

309
00:28:12,874 --> 00:28:16,926
You'll make some money for
yourself and rule the world?

310
00:28:18,426 --> 00:28:23,891
I see living in the can only filled
you with silly illusions of grandeur.

311
00:28:24,534 --> 00:28:26,022
Nah.

312
00:28:26,961 --> 00:28:29,324
I have no intention 
of stealing anything.

313
00:28:30,038 --> 00:28:33,549
Be it money or my life,

314
00:28:34,183 --> 00:28:36,645
I won't ever let anyone
steal anything from me again.

315
00:28:38,653 --> 00:28:41,363
Because no matter how filthy
this world has become,

316
00:28:42,016 --> 00:28:45,784
it is too unfair to live in a place
where being powerless becomes a crime.

317
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,215
Listen well.

318
00:28:49,485 --> 00:28:51,614
You'll never keep that land.

319
00:28:51,987 --> 00:28:53,839
You don't have the power for it.

320
00:28:53,969 --> 00:28:55,388
Really?

321
00:28:57,573 --> 00:29:02,230
Then, since you have the power,
try to take it away from me.

322
00:29:02,655 --> 00:29:04,528
Hope you don't regret it.

323
00:29:05,992 --> 00:29:08,229
The visit is over.

324
00:29:12,515 --> 00:29:14,012
Right...

325
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:17,399
Send my regards to Jeongshik.

326
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:23,193
Tell him I gained a few precious 
life lessons thanks to him,

327
00:29:23,655 --> 00:29:26,177
so I will one day make it up to him.

328
00:29:49,595 --> 00:29:51,499
I'm sorry.

329
00:29:54,798 --> 00:29:57,121
It's... It's a thief!

330
00:29:57,544 --> 00:29:59,488
Thief!

331
00:29:59,642 --> 00:30:03,604
What are you doing?
He just stole your wallet!

332
00:30:03,785 --> 00:30:07,944
Hey! You thief!
Stop there, you thief!

333
00:30:08,078 --> 00:30:10,203
Hurry up! Let's go!

334
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:25,404
What now?
Was there a lot of money inside?

335
00:30:26,541 --> 00:30:29,311
Mind your own business and go.

336
00:30:30,665 --> 00:30:33,984
So I guess you live nearby?

337
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:40,758
Since you must have no money,
I wonder if you can get there on foot.

338
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:51,971
<i>Take the bus home with this.</i>

339
00:30:52,264 --> 00:30:55,890
I had to walk home once
because of a pickpocket,

340
00:30:56,023 --> 00:30:58,406
and you won't believe how hard it was.

341
00:31:00,453 --> 00:31:04,639
I won't ask you to pay it back, 
so don't feel burdened.

342
00:31:05,594 --> 00:31:07,227
By any chance,

343
00:31:08,812 --> 00:31:10,941
have we met before?

344
00:31:12,493 --> 00:31:13,743
Right?!

345
00:31:13,908 --> 00:31:16,231
We met somewhere, didn't we?

346
00:31:16,352 --> 00:31:18,111
<i>Where was it...</i>

347
00:31:18,747 --> 00:31:20,392
Ahh! Right!

348
00:31:22,279 --> 00:31:23,791
That's not it...

349
00:31:23,994 --> 00:31:27,275
He went to Saudi Arabia 
to make money...

350
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,134
- You wouldn't be...
- You remember now?

351
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,266
in cahoots with that 
pickpocket, would you?

352
00:31:36,365 --> 00:31:37,267
What?

353
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:38,851
Isn't it strange?

354
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:42,737
Being so kind to someone
you've never met before.

355
00:31:43,596 --> 00:31:44,325
Look.

356
00:31:44,413 --> 00:31:47,176
Not to mention pretending you
know me, when you clearly don't.

357
00:31:48,127 --> 00:31:49,644
Give this back.

358
00:31:51,591 --> 00:31:54,177
I said give me back my token!

359
00:32:09,263 --> 00:32:11,150
Found it.

360
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:23,046
Do you know how much hard work 
it takes to earn this token?

361
00:32:23,239 --> 00:32:26,493
You don't even deserve 
to get this much!

362
00:32:26,614 --> 00:32:29,165
People should show some gratitude...

363
00:32:29,312 --> 00:32:30,881
Wait, that tok...

364
00:32:30,978 --> 00:32:36,276
Also, what's with the attitude?
Ruin the mood, will you...

365
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:54,271
Our competitors are using
a similar concept for their ads.

366
00:32:54,622 --> 00:33:01,157
Seems like they're preparing a TV commercial, 
so better go for something fresh.

367
00:33:03,528 --> 00:33:04,931
Hwang Jeongyeon.

368
00:33:05,318 --> 00:33:07,326
Let's have a word in private.

369
00:33:17,457 --> 00:33:20,469
It's our strategic plan
for the apartment ads.

370
00:33:21,751 --> 00:33:24,546
Did you know Gangmo gained possession
of those Gaepo-Dong mudflats?

371
00:33:24,646 --> 00:33:26,348
Give it a read and 
let us know your decision.

372
00:33:26,433 --> 00:33:29,323
Do you know how he got
his hands on that land?

373
00:33:29,419 --> 00:33:31,211
And why would that matter in any way?

374
00:33:31,356 --> 00:33:33,787
He got it in exchange
for giving up on you.

375
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:36,847
He exchanged it with you!

376
00:33:37,005 --> 00:33:38,431
I know.

377
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,808
You do?!

378
00:33:40,917 --> 00:33:42,634
And so what?

379
00:33:43,517 --> 00:33:44,896
I perfectly understand him.

380
00:33:44,969 --> 00:33:48,126
I hear he even refuses to meet you.

381
00:33:48,295 --> 00:33:50,037
Doesn't it hurt your pride?

382
00:33:50,147 --> 00:33:53,734
Gangmo thinks that
it's all for my own sake.

383
00:33:54,595 --> 00:33:55,443
What?!

384
00:33:55,515 --> 00:33:58,602
Do you realize why I only
have eyes for work these days?

385
00:33:58,769 --> 00:34:02,906
To establish my footing in the
company before Gangmo is released.

386
00:34:03,087 --> 00:34:05,790
Because that is what's 
best for Gangmo's sake.

387
00:34:07,159 --> 00:34:10,943
I respect and acknowledge
your authority as my superior.

388
00:34:11,801 --> 00:34:15,479
And I'm thankful you agreed to
break off the engagement as I wished.

389
00:34:15,974 --> 00:34:19,808
But beyond that, I suggest
you mind your own business.

390
00:34:19,977 --> 00:34:22,844
You've got it all wrong,
Hwang Jeongyeon.

391
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:28,238
Gangmo is not the 
kind of man you think he is.

392
00:34:28,795 --> 00:34:30,851
He's changed.

393
00:34:42,885 --> 00:34:43,926
So?

394
00:34:44,097 --> 00:34:46,479
Gangmo refuses to sell that land?

395
00:34:46,589 --> 00:34:50,632
He looked about to trample
anything in his way when he gets out.

396
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:52,838
Do what? To whom?

397
00:34:53,613 --> 00:34:54,750
Me?

398
00:34:55,184 --> 00:34:58,427
He's aware that it 
was you who caused this.

399
00:34:58,753 --> 00:35:01,017
With his personality,
think he'd let this slide?

400
00:35:02,602 --> 00:35:07,198
The chairman is willing 
to welcome him back.

401
00:35:08,347 --> 00:35:13,505
And with that land, Gangmo might 
suddenly find himself as director.

402
00:35:13,614 --> 00:35:15,053
What do we do now...

403
00:35:15,162 --> 00:35:18,506
He will try to help Jeongyeon 
every step of the way?

404
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:21,680
Then this company will
fall under her control.

405
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:23,835
That land is the issue.

406
00:35:24,185 --> 00:35:26,626
All we need to do is
get our hands on that land.

407
00:35:26,744 --> 00:35:29,131
Then we'll cut off his wings 
before he can ever fly.

408
00:35:30,727 --> 00:35:32,602
You can see his vital points,

409
00:35:33,025 --> 00:35:35,626
but there is no way to hit them...

410
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:39,158
So if...

411
00:35:39,566 --> 00:35:41,670
It's just an "if," mind you.

412
00:35:42,123 --> 00:35:45,605
If Gangmo was out of the picture, 
how would things change?

413
00:35:49,859 --> 00:35:51,129
What do you mean?

414
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:54,733
Gangmo is still an orphan
without a single relative.

415
00:35:54,853 --> 00:35:58,579
That means nobody can
inherit that land from him.

416
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:01,386
So?

417
00:36:02,378 --> 00:36:05,118
Isn't that what you 
really want, deep down?

418
00:36:05,228 --> 00:36:09,642
Since without him around,
Jeongyeon will be yours.

419
00:36:11,361 --> 00:36:14,190
Both for me, you, and
our company's future,

420
00:36:14,299 --> 00:36:16,792
getting rid of him would be...

421
00:36:21,182 --> 00:36:24,762
What could you possibly have been 
talking about, to act like that?

422
00:36:24,955 --> 00:36:27,400
<i>Uh?! Nah... It's nothing.</i>

423
00:36:27,529 --> 00:36:29,080
See you later this evening.

424
00:36:29,201 --> 00:36:30,882
You...

425
00:36:32,419 --> 00:36:34,389
The police was looking for you.

426
00:36:34,564 --> 00:36:35,641
Uh?!

427
00:36:36,463 --> 00:36:38,496
The police? Why?

428
00:36:39,512 --> 00:36:42,578
Your boys must have 
caused some trouble.

429
00:36:43,153 --> 00:36:44,906
Ehh... What else could it be...

430
00:36:45,014 --> 00:36:46,660
It's nothing.

431
00:37:08,057 --> 00:37:11,599
Hey... Did we do anything wrong?

432
00:37:12,083 --> 00:37:14,216
We'll be out in no time,
so keep your head up.

433
00:37:14,284 --> 00:37:16,387
<i>Go ahead, you fool.</i>

434
00:37:16,899 --> 00:37:19,036
<i>Manbo Construction, come out.</i>

435
00:37:19,992 --> 00:37:21,879
See, what did I tell you?

436
00:37:24,402 --> 00:37:26,750
Next time we catch you, you're dead!

437
00:37:26,883 --> 00:37:29,194
Take your time, fellas.

438
00:37:29,254 --> 00:37:32,326
We'll go ahead first.

439
00:37:36,197 --> 00:37:37,287
What's this?

440
00:37:38,036 --> 00:37:43,006
Don't you know me? I'm Chief of
Goods & Services for Manbo Construction.

441
00:37:43,134 --> 00:37:44,175
Get out of here!

442
00:37:44,296 --> 00:37:47,090
<i>Uh?! Young Master...</i>

443
00:37:47,236 --> 00:37:50,139
Detective, you must have misunde...

444
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:56,861
Young Master... What is this?
Did I do anything wrong?

445
00:38:04,606 --> 00:38:06,525
Hey... Hwang Jeongshik!

446
00:38:06,731 --> 00:38:08,281
You!

447
00:38:08,922 --> 00:38:11,039
Hwang Jeongshik!

448
00:38:18,526 --> 00:38:22,281
As you said, 
I only left Sotae behind.

449
00:38:23,539 --> 00:38:27,712
But will he do as we say?

450
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,305
You know dog fights?

451
00:38:32,067 --> 00:38:35,192
Nobody would feed his dog 
before a fight.

452
00:38:35,302 --> 00:38:39,197
You must starve them enough 
to make them boil with rage,

453
00:38:39,246 --> 00:38:42,052
if you want them 
to bite their adversary.

454
00:38:45,245 --> 00:38:46,937
Jo Minwoo...

455
00:38:47,046 --> 00:38:48,825
You sure are smart.

456
00:38:51,561 --> 00:38:54,621
<i>In this first electoral registration
since the new government took office,</i>

457
00:38:54,752 --> 00:38:57,936
<i>candidates from every region
have begun their campaign in earnest.</i>

458
00:38:58,057 --> 00:39:00,725
<i>With the active participation 
of the electorate,</i>

459
00:39:00,847 --> 00:39:03,730
<i>pushing to expose corruption
and asking for stability,</i>

460
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:07,875
<i>the upcoming elections are expected to be 
the most transparent and fair to date.</i>

461
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:15,308
<i>President Jeon Duhwan heralded
the advent of a new democratic...</i>

462
00:39:18,274 --> 00:39:19,774
I found it.

463
00:39:20,592 --> 00:39:22,048
It's evidence that 
Jo Pilyeon's father worked...

464
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:25,181
for the Governor-General
during the colonial period.

465
00:39:26,242 --> 00:39:27,706
<i>{\a6}*How Japan defined the 1941 war
against Western Allies and China</i>

466
00:39:26,242 --> 00:39:27,706
During the Greater East Asia war*,

467
00:39:27,779 --> 00:39:32,640
he even willfully provided goods plundered 
in Joseon to the Japanese government.

468
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:38,111
So what's with this record about a
math professor at Keijo Imperial University?

469
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:39,462
Just someone with the same name.

470
00:39:39,571 --> 00:39:42,304
That record was meticulously forged.

471
00:39:44,046 --> 00:39:46,066
Keep digging into it.

472
00:39:46,187 --> 00:39:50,796
We must cause Jo Pilyeon
to fail at these elections.

473
00:39:50,977 --> 00:39:52,746
Yes, Seonbaenim.

474
00:40:07,304 --> 00:40:09,554
<i>Go ahead and help yourselves.</i>

475
00:40:09,663 --> 00:40:14,373
If you help Candidate No. 4 
Jo Pilyeon get elected,

476
00:40:14,491 --> 00:40:17,223
this is the kind of feast you
can expect from me every day.

477
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:22,326
After all, doesn't public discipline
begin from caring for our elders?

478
00:40:22,416 --> 00:40:25,511
Well said!

479
00:40:25,629 --> 00:40:28,631
Jo Pilyeon! Jo Pilyeon!

480
00:40:28,765 --> 00:40:32,120
Candidate No. 4 Jo Pilyeon!

481
00:40:37,106 --> 00:40:39,150
Ma'am, here's some money for you.

482
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:41,593
Sir, some pocket money.

483
00:40:41,666 --> 00:40:43,492
Remember, Candidate No. 4 Jo Pilyeon.

484
00:40:43,565 --> 00:40:49,541
We'll be counting on you.
Remember to vote.

485
00:40:55,274 --> 00:40:57,379
Aigoo...

486
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:04,888
Seeing your noble struggle
as an independent just humbles me.

487
00:41:04,989 --> 00:41:07,846
Affiliations can always change.

488
00:41:07,969 --> 00:41:11,843
If you lose out, I'm sure the ruling
party will welcome me with open arms.

489
00:41:11,997 --> 00:41:14,987
From what I hear, you're sprinkling
money everywhere you go?!

490
00:41:15,099 --> 00:41:17,176
You can call that skills.

491
00:41:17,281 --> 00:41:21,136
Shouldn't we help out those poor
working-class people, for a change?

492
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,571
Hope you're not taking
the election law too lightly.

493
00:41:23,678 --> 00:41:25,797
It wouldn't be the first time someone 
steps down and is incarcerated.

494
00:41:25,894 --> 00:41:31,824
And I suggest you keep that superficial
smear campaign of yours in check.

495
00:41:32,009 --> 00:41:35,637
Anyhow, let's give it our best.

496
00:41:36,811 --> 00:41:40,681
Let's save that for after 
the elections, shall we?

497
00:41:40,935 --> 00:41:46,048
Because when they're over, more than
encouragement you'll need some consolation.

498
00:42:03,574 --> 00:42:08,495
Here... Enjoy your food,
and please listen to me.

499
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:10,708
I'm Candidate No. 1 Min Honggi,

500
00:42:10,781 --> 00:42:14,204
and as my entire career as public 
servant was marked by integrity,

501
00:42:14,337 --> 00:42:19,612
I'm afraid I don't have the means
to appease you with such generosity.

502
00:42:19,744 --> 00:42:24,355
<i>If any of my competitors gave
you money, go ahead and take it.</i>

503
00:42:24,477 --> 00:42:26,666
You can take that money,

504
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:31,874
but remember to cast your vote 
for Candidate No. 1, Min Honggi.

505
00:42:33,965 --> 00:42:35,990
Folks.

506
00:42:36,232 --> 00:42:39,897
What our country 
most requires is stability.

507
00:42:40,018 --> 00:42:44,626
The northern puppet regime is
threatening our borders every day.

508
00:42:44,759 --> 00:42:49,470
Remember how many struggles
you had to go through during the war?

509
00:42:49,773 --> 00:42:53,837
And that is why you should 
choose stability above all,

510
00:42:53,970 --> 00:42:56,970
and accord your precious votes to me, 
Candidate No. 1 Min Honggi.

511
00:42:57,115 --> 00:42:58,470
Well said!

512
00:42:58,566 --> 00:43:04,638
And so you will live a long and prosperous
life, in the stable country you deserve.

513
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:08,487
Min Honggi! Min Honggi!

514
00:43:08,613 --> 00:43:11,808
Candidate No. 1 Min Honggi!

515
00:43:28,643 --> 00:43:34,835
I just gave you some funding,
and now you ask for more?

516
00:43:35,023 --> 00:43:37,455
Have you even listened to
what I've been telling you?

517
00:43:37,564 --> 00:43:40,588
The situation is becoming urgent.

518
00:43:41,267 --> 00:43:44,233
The campaign has just started.

519
00:43:44,337 --> 00:43:47,239
- If you already start acting this way...
- Listen, Chairman Hwang.

520
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:50,860
Do I really need to go through
this every time I need money?

521
00:43:51,175 --> 00:43:53,969
<i>{\a6}*Agency for National Security Planning,
KCIA's post-coup "rebranding"</i>

522
00:43:51,175 --> 00:43:53,969
- Be that as it may...
- The ANSP* Director...

523
00:43:54,126 --> 00:43:56,175
is a close friend of mine.

524
00:43:56,303 --> 00:44:00,090
I even was offered a spot back there
in case I decided to give up the elections.

525
00:44:01,134 --> 00:44:04,578
Think I wouldn't have
connections in the Blue House?

526
00:44:04,853 --> 00:44:06,199
What I'm trying to say is...

527
00:44:06,308 --> 00:44:10,264
I'm not losing my teeth,
but new ones are emerging,

528
00:44:10,375 --> 00:44:14,654
claws I'll bite this world with!
Is that clear, Chairman Hwang?

529
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:17,980
<i>Come on in.</i>

530
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:26,770
So what did the ANSP have
to say about public sentiment?

531
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:31,161
It's still early, but you and Min Honggi
will have a very tight race.

532
00:44:31,572 --> 00:44:33,181
Have you heard?

533
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:35,951
Using the ruling party's
support as an excuse,

534
00:44:36,035 --> 00:44:38,897
Min Honggi is prancing around
prattling about stability and whatnot.

535
00:44:39,002 --> 00:44:42,301
What could we possibly do 
to contend him?

536
00:44:42,942 --> 00:44:48,049
So, how much are you looking for?

537
00:44:48,169 --> 00:44:50,816
The more, the merrier.

538
00:44:51,784 --> 00:44:53,732
More...

539
00:44:54,257 --> 00:44:55,812
Seongmo.

540
00:44:56,446 --> 00:44:59,987
You find Min Honggi's weak spot.

541
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,428
For weak spot...

542
00:45:02,537 --> 00:45:06,113
We've learned that Min Honggi's
father was a ruthless officer...

543
00:45:06,221 --> 00:45:08,217
who captured countless independence
activists during Japanese rule.

544
00:45:08,314 --> 00:45:12,378
I'm sure you'll find some of
those victims if you dig deep enough,

545
00:45:12,475 --> 00:45:14,301
so find us someone who will testify.

546
00:45:14,761 --> 00:45:16,128
All right.

547
00:45:16,597 --> 00:45:19,725
We only have two 
countermeasures on our table.

548
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:21,999
Ingratiate ourselves with
the electorate through money,

549
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:26,594
and smearing Min Honggi,
there is no other way.

550
00:45:33,999 --> 00:45:38,472
Hey!
Tell Hwang Jeongshik to call me!

551
00:45:38,596 --> 00:45:41,936
Want to see me bite my tongue 
and die inside here?

552
00:45:42,044 --> 00:45:43,517
Think I wouldn't have the guts?

553
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:45,452
I'll do it! Wanna see?

554
00:45:45,537 --> 00:45:47,593
Fine, you sons of...

555
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:57,825
The hell is this?

556
00:45:57,921 --> 00:45:59,555
Can you do this to me?

557
00:45:59,676 --> 00:46:00,546
Look.

558
00:46:00,631 --> 00:46:03,208
Mister Hwang Jeongshik!

559
00:46:11,806 --> 00:46:14,805
<i>Here... Have a drink.</i>

560
00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:20,570
I've heard a lot about you.

561
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:24,321
So you're Jeongshik's accomplice?

562
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:32,067
Acc...Acco...Accomplice?!

563
00:46:32,261 --> 00:46:36,337
Thanks to you, Lee Gangmo
is in the can instead of him.

564
00:46:36,518 --> 00:46:38,772
If that's not being
an accomplice, what is?

565
00:46:39,147 --> 00:46:43,526
I really don't know what
you're trying to do here, but...

566
00:46:43,598 --> 00:46:44,941
<i>You.</i>

567
00:46:45,993 --> 00:46:47,809
Know that Lee Gangmo 
has land in his name?

568
00:46:47,903 --> 00:46:50,182
La...Land?!

569
00:46:50,338 --> 00:46:54,910
That lot soon to become a
residential goldmine, Gaepo.

570
00:46:55,033 --> 00:46:56,511
That's Lee Gangmo's property.

571
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:57,970
What?

572
00:46:58,418 --> 00:47:02,131
And when did he ever find the money...

573
00:47:02,521 --> 00:47:05,228
We'll have to get 
our hands on that land.

574
00:47:05,464 --> 00:47:07,152
Help us out.

575
00:47:07,277 --> 00:47:08,352
Me?

576
00:47:08,476 --> 00:47:14,450
If you help us get it back,
half of it is yours.

577
00:47:17,026 --> 00:47:18,936
With that much land,

578
00:47:19,342 --> 00:47:24,397
you'll spend the rest of your life
in luxury, as people call you "Director."

579
00:47:24,677 --> 00:47:26,951
How about it?

580
00:47:38,183 --> 00:47:43,018
What do you want me to do?

581
00:47:46,124 --> 00:47:47,926
Lee Gangmo...

582
00:47:48,337 --> 00:47:50,087
must die.

583
00:47:51,857 --> 00:47:54,131
Get rid of him.

584
00:48:11,991 --> 00:48:13,678
Should go well, right?

585
00:48:13,766 --> 00:48:18,018
Park Sotae would do anything 
for the right price.

586
00:48:18,478 --> 00:48:19,942
By the way,

587
00:48:20,474 --> 00:48:23,014
wasn't "half" a little 
too over the top?

588
00:48:23,268 --> 00:48:26,111
Don't tell me you believed that?

589
00:48:26,488 --> 00:48:28,260
Of course not.

590
00:48:28,388 --> 00:48:29,950
What kind of land are we dealing with?!

591
00:48:30,057 --> 00:48:34,773
Once Gangmo is taken care of, 
we'll just give him enough to keep quiet.

592
00:48:35,209 --> 00:48:40,181
And if he plays hard to please,
spending life in the can is always an option.

593
00:48:47,567 --> 00:48:52,796
<i>He gained that land in exchange
for doing time in the can.</i>

594
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:55,239
<i>Who wouldn't?!</i>

595
00:48:57,913 --> 00:49:04,952
Fine... All my life boiled down to was
prancing around carrying lead pipes,

596
00:49:06,052 --> 00:49:08,960
why wouldn't I?

597
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:16,338
We only live once anyway.

598
00:49:16,605 --> 00:49:23,269
When this is all said and done,
I'll finally live in luxury like they do.

599
00:49:35,659 --> 00:49:37,479
Wait... Young lady.

600
00:49:37,607 --> 00:49:40,070
Where is Park Seokchun 
Seonsaeng's studio?

601
00:49:40,183 --> 00:49:43,734
Ahh... Go straight down this hallway.

602
00:49:47,932 --> 00:49:52,127
If you dress her up nicely,
wouldn't look too bad, don't you think?

603
00:49:52,393 --> 00:49:54,398
Let's go.

604
00:49:55,172 --> 00:49:56,672
Chief.

605
00:50:05,488 --> 00:50:09,411
You're my beloved...

606
00:50:25,558 --> 00:50:28,286
He's working right now, so I'm 
afraid he won't be able to meet you.

607
00:50:28,395 --> 00:50:33,097
Do we really need a composer 
to sign a contract?

608
00:50:33,282 --> 00:50:34,540
Seal it.

609
00:50:34,951 --> 00:50:36,354
Yes.

610
00:50:38,931 --> 00:50:40,660
One more over here.

611
00:50:45,933 --> 00:50:49,412
<i>{\a6}*Commercial Movie,
predecessor of CFs</i>

612
00:50:45,933 --> 00:50:49,412
We'll be counting on you for
our Manbo Construction's CM* song.

613
00:50:49,535 --> 00:50:52,674
As for the money,
you can wire it to her account.

614
00:50:52,804 --> 00:50:53,791
Tomorrow should be fine, I suppose?

615
00:50:53,851 --> 00:50:56,430
Don't you worry about that.

616
00:50:56,540 --> 00:51:00,092
I might be Chief of Management, but...

617
00:51:00,866 --> 00:51:02,293
Chief Moon?!

618
00:51:02,644 --> 00:51:08,396
He's also the only son of Manbo
Construction's Chairman Hwang.

619
00:51:08,506 --> 00:51:10,354
I'm aware.

620
00:51:10,459 --> 00:51:12,155
You know me?

621
00:51:12,603 --> 00:51:14,263
Wow... That's an honor!

622
00:51:14,371 --> 00:51:18,405
The owner of the Royal Club knows me...

623
00:51:18,965 --> 00:51:20,598
I'll get going.

624
00:51:21,517 --> 00:51:23,866
Why don't we have lunch together...

625
00:51:28,397 --> 00:51:31,268
Ehh... What the hell...

626
00:51:33,615 --> 00:51:35,366
Have any decent looker around here?

627
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:37,096
What?

628
00:51:37,773 --> 00:51:40,120
Have you any pretty lady here?

629
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:41,003
Chief...

630
00:51:41,087 --> 00:51:43,349
Let go.

631
00:51:43,755 --> 00:51:45,048
None?

632
00:51:45,134 --> 00:51:49,245
How many cookies could a good cook
cook if a good cook could cook cookies?

633
00:51:49,318 --> 00:51:53,116
A good cook could cook as many cookies
as a good cook who could cook cookies.

634
00:51:53,237 --> 00:51:54,712
I wish to wish the
wish you wish to wish,

635
00:51:54,761 --> 00:51:56,672
but if you wish the
wish the witch wishes,

636
00:51:56,757 --> 00:52:00,567
I won't wish the wish 
you wish to wish.

637
00:52:01,982 --> 00:52:08,023
A-e-i-o-e-u-a-o-a-e-i-o-u...

638
00:52:09,971 --> 00:52:12,763
She's so damn noisy...

639
00:52:12,876 --> 00:52:15,184
Did she rent the
woman's room to practice?

640
00:52:30,634 --> 00:52:33,489
Oh my! So you were there?!

641
00:52:33,793 --> 00:52:36,331
You really!

642
00:52:38,618 --> 00:52:40,305
<i>Stop there, you little...</i>

643
00:52:43,073 --> 00:52:44,299
<i>Chief!</i>

644
00:52:44,433 --> 00:52:46,622
What the hell are you doing?

645
00:52:47,009 --> 00:52:48,412
I'm so sorry...

646
00:52:48,591 --> 00:52:49,559
I apologize.

647
00:52:49,631 --> 00:52:51,881
My suit...

648
00:52:51,990 --> 00:52:55,268
Know how much this cost?

649
00:52:59,538 --> 00:53:02,950
I'm sorry.
They're still so immature.

650
00:53:04,412 --> 00:53:06,403
I sincerely apologize.

651
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:08,982
<i>We apologize.</i>

652
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:13,870
I'll compensate you for all the damages.

653
00:53:14,001 --> 00:53:15,562
Compensate?!

654
00:53:15,804 --> 00:53:18,900
Do you even know how much this cost?

655
00:53:19,005 --> 00:53:21,734
How... much is it?

656
00:53:21,844 --> 00:53:24,014
This cost no less than...

657
00:53:25,103 --> 00:53:26,835
Ehh... Forget it.

658
00:53:26,957 --> 00:53:30,679
You spoiled the mood,
so let's just go eat out.

659
00:53:31,513 --> 00:53:32,723
What?

660
00:53:33,529 --> 00:53:37,537
I'll treat you tonight.

661
00:53:40,266 --> 00:53:42,743
- Hey, country chick.
- What?

662
00:53:43,102 --> 00:53:45,414
You mean... me?

663
00:53:45,509 --> 00:53:47,939
Yeah, you. Country chick.

664
00:53:48,955 --> 00:53:50,795
What would you like to eat?

665
00:53:53,239 --> 00:53:55,476
<i>Cheers!</i>

666
00:54:02,782 --> 00:54:06,088
You two...
Have anything to tell me?

667
00:54:06,206 --> 00:54:11,110
Are you really the son of
Manbo Construction's chairman?

668
00:54:11,264 --> 00:54:14,267
Why? Want me to put in a good word?

669
00:54:14,412 --> 00:54:19,626
If I only wanted, I could get
you on that ad any time?!

670
00:54:19,783 --> 00:54:21,380
Really?

671
00:54:21,561 --> 00:54:25,321
Of course, you cute little brat...

672
00:54:27,652 --> 00:54:29,169
Hey, country chick.

673
00:54:29,327 --> 00:54:31,770
You come all the way here 
and drink cola?

674
00:54:31,881 --> 00:54:33,070
Here... Have a drink.

675
00:54:33,183 --> 00:54:35,693
No. I really can't handle alcohol.

676
00:54:35,779 --> 00:54:37,737
Ehh...

677
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:41,922
But...

678
00:54:43,605 --> 00:54:45,797
You sure are pretty.

679
00:54:46,281 --> 00:54:51,060
Should we call in the band 
and dance the blues?

680
00:54:51,161 --> 00:54:52,655
I don't really know how to dance.

681
00:54:52,776 --> 00:54:55,945
What else you don't know?

682
00:54:57,614 --> 00:55:01,414
If you really want to
succeed in this trade,

683
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:05,815
just go "Sure, I'm good at it!"

684
00:55:05,936 --> 00:55:09,023
- Got it?
- What's wrong with you?

685
00:55:09,137 --> 00:55:11,272
<i>Just stay put...</i>

686
00:55:13,764 --> 00:55:17,997
Hey... I told you to rush,
why are you so late?

687
00:55:18,408 --> 00:55:19,765
What are you doing here?

688
00:55:19,855 --> 00:55:21,637
What do you think?

689
00:55:21,738 --> 00:55:24,268
I'm meeting our ad's models.

690
00:55:24,374 --> 00:55:25,263
<i>Say hi.</i>

691
00:55:25,372 --> 00:55:27,717
<i>He's Manbo Construction's 
Chief of Planning.</i>

692
00:55:28,142 --> 00:55:30,196
How are you?

693
00:55:32,242 --> 00:55:33,455
How about the contract?

694
00:55:33,567 --> 00:55:34,758
Yes, it...

695
00:55:34,891 --> 00:55:38,601
Already signed and sealed,
so don't you worry.

696
00:55:38,916 --> 00:55:41,902
Minwoo, let's have some fun tonight.

697
00:55:42,024 --> 00:55:44,444
What are you waiting for?
Go get the chief.

698
00:55:44,552 --> 00:55:48,786
Chief, come have a drink with us.

699
00:56:06,557 --> 00:56:08,904
Hey... Token.

700
00:56:11,867 --> 00:56:14,749
We meet again...

701
00:56:14,859 --> 00:56:18,523
What's this...
You know each other?

702
00:56:19,554 --> 00:56:21,925
You're much more resourceful 
than I thought.

703
00:56:23,436 --> 00:56:25,202
What is it you're after?

704
00:56:25,471 --> 00:56:27,960
The CM song or
becoming model for our ads?

705
00:56:28,081 --> 00:56:28,674
What?

706
00:56:28,819 --> 00:56:32,174
You approached me on purpose.

707
00:56:32,297 --> 00:56:34,031
To secure one of the two.

708
00:56:34,144 --> 00:56:35,093
I did what?

709
00:56:35,199 --> 00:56:39,711
Why? Since it doesn't work with me,
you go straight for Jeongshik?

710
00:56:40,084 --> 00:56:43,701
- Listen!
- Jeongshik likes aggressive women.

711
00:56:44,310 --> 00:56:48,382
Give it your best shot tonight, 
you might even get the contract you want.

712
00:56:55,217 --> 00:56:57,914
Girls are scary, these days.

713
00:56:58,072 --> 00:57:01,073
<i>They don't look anyone in the face 
to make it big, do they?</i>

714
00:57:05,778 --> 00:57:09,419
What is he prattling about?

715
00:57:09,624 --> 00:57:11,862
Hey... Did you two...

716
00:57:15,155 --> 00:57:16,897
The hell is wrong with them?

717
00:57:17,038 --> 00:57:18,651
Wait!

718
00:57:23,501 --> 00:57:25,195
Apologize.

719
00:57:25,703 --> 00:57:26,289
What?

720
00:57:26,382 --> 00:57:29,179
Take back what you said.

721
00:57:31,211 --> 00:57:35,612
I did nothing to deserve
that treatment from you,

722
00:57:35,713 --> 00:57:37,900
and I'm not that kind of woman.

723
00:57:40,822 --> 00:57:42,491
Wanna come in?

724
00:57:43,470 --> 00:57:45,974
You're just doing this to ride with me.

725
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:48,865
Guess you thought 
I was better than Jeongshik.

726
00:57:48,962 --> 00:57:49,930
What?

727
00:57:50,039 --> 00:57:51,127
<i>Where shall we go?</i>

728
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:54,323
A bar? Hotel?

729
00:57:56,115 --> 00:58:01,718
But I'm afraid you
barked up the wrong tree.

730
00:58:02,404 --> 00:58:04,678
I can't stand easy women.

731
00:58:05,494 --> 00:58:10,387
If you really want to succeed that bad, 
go back inside and seduce Jeongshik.

732
00:58:10,672 --> 00:58:12,818
<i>That'd be much eas...</i>

733
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:17,245
<i>Don't look down on people.</i>

734
00:58:17,317 --> 00:58:19,253
You insolent prick...

735
00:58:19,410 --> 00:58:21,310
Taxi!

736
00:58:25,117 --> 00:58:28,519
That little brat...

737
00:58:30,489 --> 00:58:32,594
Hey... Stop there!

738
00:58:32,741 --> 00:58:34,247
Hey!

739
00:58:37,464 --> 00:58:39,351
<i>Where shall we go?</i>

740
00:58:41,952 --> 00:58:43,004
Young lady?

741
00:58:43,173 --> 00:58:44,591
Uh?

742
00:58:45,946 --> 00:58:51,171
Just take me to the nearest bus stop.

743
00:58:52,090 --> 00:58:53,348
Are you kidding me?

744
00:58:53,481 --> 00:58:55,779
I'm sorry, Ajeosshi.

745
00:58:56,614 --> 00:59:01,636
I don't have enough money,
so I'll just pay the basic fare.

746
00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:27,834
You rotten bastard...

747
00:59:27,947 --> 00:59:30,688
What do you take me for?

748
00:59:54,012 --> 00:59:56,879
<i>You'll be sent to the
same cell as Lee Gangmo.</i>

749
00:59:57,113 --> 00:59:59,437
<i>You must find the right opportunity 
and end it in one strike.</i>

750
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:01,281
<i>Just one.</i>

751
01:00:03,398 --> 01:00:06,244
One... Two...

752
01:00:06,534 --> 01:00:09,594
- One... Two...
- Here, come in.

753
01:00:15,134 --> 01:00:17,360
<i>He's new here,
so spare me the usual mess.</i>

754
01:00:17,481 --> 01:00:18,485
<i>Yes.</i>

755
01:00:18,593 --> 01:00:22,031
<i>Aigoo... Just a look at him
and I lose my appetite.</i>

756
01:00:22,212 --> 01:00:23,615
Petty offense, I bet?

757
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:24,958
Right?

758
01:00:25,272 --> 01:00:27,208
Theft or adultery?

759
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:36,485
You little... Got something
stuck down your ears?

760
01:00:36,595 --> 01:00:38,298
Gangmo!

761
01:00:40,705 --> 01:00:44,706
It's me... Sotae!
Wow... What a coincidence.

762
01:00:44,897 --> 01:00:46,141
Sotae...

763
01:00:46,239 --> 01:00:49,062
Hyungnim, you know him?

764
01:00:56,803 --> 01:00:58,763
Never seen him before.

765
01:00:59,691 --> 01:01:02,425
Gangmo!

766
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:05,014
You know I can't stand conmen, right?

767
01:01:05,134 --> 01:01:06,900
What's wrong? It's me!
Sotae... Park Sotae!

768
01:01:06,997 --> 01:01:11,678
How dare you mention his name 
in vain and try to fool people?

769
01:01:11,739 --> 01:01:14,509
It's not that, 
Gangmo and I have been fr...

770
01:01:15,335 --> 01:01:16,823
<i>Teach him a lesson!</i>

771
01:01:17,972 --> 01:01:19,109
Help me!

772
01:01:19,182 --> 01:01:21,608
Help me, Gangmo!

773
01:01:21,764 --> 01:01:23,431
Gangmo!

774
01:01:24,042 --> 01:01:26,076
<i>Gangmo!</i>

775
01:01:43,645 --> 01:01:45,411
Gangmo.

776
01:01:48,003 --> 01:01:49,860
Have some.

777
01:01:54,273 --> 01:01:59,860
Seems like you're
misunderstanding something.

778
01:02:00,887 --> 01:02:05,405
I know what you're thinking,
but it's not what happened.

779
01:02:05,537 --> 01:02:09,696
I was in urgent need of money
so I sort of took the easy way out,

780
01:02:09,756 --> 01:02:12,623
but once I came back, 
I found out what happened to you.

781
01:02:12,695 --> 01:02:14,014
<i>Hyungnim.</i>

782
01:02:14,764 --> 01:02:17,582
- Eat to your heart's content.
- Have a nice meal.

783
01:02:20,267 --> 01:02:21,239
Yes.

784
01:02:31,472 --> 01:02:34,025
How the hell do you teach newcomers?

785
01:02:34,122 --> 01:02:37,493
Do I still have to endure
bullshit artists prancing around?

786
01:02:39,501 --> 01:02:41,763
I apologize, Hyungnim.

787
01:02:59,325 --> 01:03:01,030
Stop!

788
01:03:05,993 --> 01:03:10,057
You! Try to talk to him just once more.

789
01:03:10,468 --> 01:03:12,077
Next time I'll just bury you.

790
01:03:12,170 --> 01:03:13,867
Got it?

791
01:03:21,750 --> 01:03:23,879
Fine, Lee Gangmo...

792
01:03:24,226 --> 01:03:27,302
You want to take it to the end? 
Fine with me.

793
01:04:11,857 --> 01:04:14,603
<i>So long, Lee Gangmo.</i>

794
01:04:15,244 --> 01:04:20,941
<i>When we meet again in the afterlife,
get all the revenge you want.</i>

795
01:04:21,589 --> 01:04:29,370
<i>I'll just be content having a
nice life while I'm still alive.</i>

796
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:38,937
Want to kill me, don't you?

797
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:44,755
<i>I'm sure you do.</i>

798
01:04:46,257 --> 01:04:49,356
I know you better than you think.

799
01:04:51,389 --> 01:04:54,316
You've always been easily scared.

800
01:04:55,550 --> 01:04:59,626
<i>And when you get scared,
afraid people will notice,</i>

801
01:05:00,206 --> 01:05:04,116
<i>you stab people in the back 
like a coward.</i>

802
01:05:05,063 --> 01:05:07,503
<i>That's your style.</i>

803
01:05:10,853 --> 01:05:15,583
- What are you saying...
- If we weren't behind bars,

804
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:18,445
I wouldn't have let this slide.

805
01:05:19,292 --> 01:05:22,545
- Gangmo, that...
- Shut your mouth.

806
01:05:25,739 --> 01:05:28,013
Spare me those pathetic excuses.

807
01:05:28,509 --> 01:05:33,689
Or I won't be responsible
for how I'll react.

808
01:05:43,999 --> 01:05:46,271
What else are you doing here?

809
01:05:46,376 --> 01:05:49,616
I... didn't... do a thing?

810
01:05:49,701 --> 01:05:51,406
So why are you here?

811
01:05:51,491 --> 01:05:54,793
I really didn't do anything.

812
01:05:59,898 --> 01:06:01,930
What's wrong with you?

813
01:06:06,914 --> 01:06:08,765
Hyungnim... Blood.

814
01:06:10,525 --> 01:06:14,081
You have hemorrhoids or something?

815
01:06:22,124 --> 01:06:24,567
Hyungnim! A knife.

816
01:06:37,340 --> 01:06:39,127
Who is it?

817
01:06:41,812 --> 01:06:44,244
Who sent you?

818
01:06:45,281 --> 01:06:47,630
G...Gangmo...

819
01:06:47,870 --> 01:06:50,122
It's a misunderstanding.

820
01:06:54,643 --> 01:06:56,639
Was it Jo Minwoo?

821
01:06:57,076 --> 01:06:58,877
Jeongshik?

822
01:07:02,977 --> 01:07:04,863
Who sent you here...

823
01:07:04,996 --> 01:07:07,028
to kill me?

824
01:07:08,011 --> 01:07:11,014

<i>Just deal with him for me.</i>

830
01:07:22,934 --> 01:07:25,789
- His name?
- Lee Gangmo.

831
01:07:25,946 --> 01:07:28,368
I will soon debut.

832
01:07:28,482 --> 01:07:30,540
<i>They said I'll even get my own stage.</i>

833
01:07:30,642 --> 01:07:34,788
I will do everything to beat Jo Pilyeon.

834
01:07:34,921 --> 01:07:36,929
What are you waiting for?
Take that briefcase back!

835
01:07:37,026 --> 01:07:39,711
So I hear Min Honggi's father
was a remarkable man.

836
01:07:39,832 --> 01:07:41,973
He was nothing
but a ruthless collaborator!

837
01:07:42,082 --> 01:07:44,626
Come to the speech.

838
01:07:44,728 --> 01:07:46,085
Gangmo is not here?

839
01:07:46,206 --> 01:07:48,084
They took him to the
Samcheong Rehabilitation Camp.

840
01:07:48,157 --> 01:07:50,673
So if he goes there, 
he'll never come back alive?

841
01:07:50,784 --> 01:07:55,390
<i>Whatever you're imagining,
it's even worse.</i>

842
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:59,176
