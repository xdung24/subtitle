Episode 59

4
00:00:24,946 --> 00:00:26,193
Excuse me.

5
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:27,877
I'd like to ask you something.

6
00:00:27,971 --> 00:00:32,260
Among the patients here,
is there a certain Lee Seongmo?

7
00:00:32,368 --> 00:00:33,758
Lee Seongmo?

8
00:00:33,851 --> 00:00:35,662
Was he hospitalized here?

9
00:00:38,784 --> 00:00:40,370
This would be him.

10
00:00:43,452 --> 00:00:46,413
Ahh... He comes
here regularly for check-ups.

11
00:00:46,522 --> 00:00:47,875
Right, it's him.

12
00:00:47,973 --> 00:00:50,655
May I have a look at his medical record?

13
00:00:50,918 --> 00:00:52,682
What for?

14
00:00:52,828 --> 00:00:56,737
Actually, he's the younger
brother I lost back in my childhood.

15
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:00,362
I really want to find him, so please help me.

16
00:01:02,089 --> 00:01:03,304
Is this him?

17
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,096
Yes, that's the man I saw.

18
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:08,814
Take a closer look.

19
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,562
Are you really sure?

20
00:01:10,687 --> 00:01:15,598
I'm a big fan of Miss Cha, so I knew
that she was looking for her brother.

21
00:01:15,925 --> 00:01:17,944
I have no doubt.

22
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:22,035
Oppa...

23
00:01:22,181 --> 00:01:23,697
Gangmo...

24
00:01:23,804 --> 00:01:26,236
Your brother was really alive.

25
00:01:26,331 --> 00:01:28,087
Where did you see him?

26
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:30,292
I'm looking for this man.

27
00:01:30,389 --> 00:01:32,543
Have you ever seen him here?

28
00:01:32,758 --> 00:01:34,974
Seems like everyone is looking for him today.

29
00:01:35,069 --> 00:01:36,502
Did anyone else come asking about him?

30
00:01:36,605 --> 00:01:39,828
Ahh... Earlier on, someone
saying he was his older brother came.

31
00:01:39,945 --> 00:01:41,742
His older brother?!

32
00:01:42,107 --> 00:01:44,822
Are you telling me this
man's older brother came here?

33
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:48,331
He just said he was his long lost brother...

34
00:01:52,308 --> 00:01:53,605
The address was wrong.

35
00:01:53,663 --> 00:01:54,826
Wrong?!

36
00:01:54,931 --> 00:01:57,462
It is true he went to that hospital,

37
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:59,726
but the address he gave them is fake.

38
00:01:59,887 --> 00:02:01,260
Then, just leave.

39
00:02:01,391 --> 00:02:03,028
Leave?!

40
00:02:03,276 --> 00:02:04,883
But, Congressman.

41
00:02:05,084 --> 00:02:09,045
Lee Seongmo might not be
mentally stable, but he is alive.

42
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:13,215
I have my plans, so just come back.

43
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:22,761
Then, I'll take another quick look
around the port and leave.

44
00:02:46,282 --> 00:02:48,291
Excuse me.

45
00:02:49,762 --> 00:02:51,399
What is the matter?

46
00:02:51,497 --> 00:02:53,697
Does a certain Lee Seongmo live here?

47
00:02:53,828 --> 00:02:59,263
And who the hell is this Lee Seongmo,
pestering people all day asking for him...

48
00:02:59,964 --> 00:03:01,542
You'll pardon me,

49
00:03:01,717 --> 00:03:04,767
- but the address I was given is this.
- Ahh... He doesn't live here.

50
00:03:04,898 --> 00:03:06,535
Just go. Aigoo... How annoying...

51
00:03:06,608 --> 00:03:08,828
Ma'am...

52
00:03:09,949 --> 00:03:13,036
That's strange?!
The address is right.

53
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:27,969
Seems like your reputation
in Sokcho precedes you.

54
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,726
I'm still nothing more than a private lender.

55
00:03:34,324 --> 00:03:38,361
He's Lee Gangmo's older brother,
currently hiding in Sokcho.

56
00:03:39,949 --> 00:03:44,654
A bullet penetrated his skull,
so he's barely surviving.

57
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:48,558
Seems he doesn't even know who he is.

58
00:03:48,671 --> 00:03:52,507
So do you want me to find him for you?

59
00:03:52,603 --> 00:03:54,467
Would that be possible?

60
00:03:54,628 --> 00:04:00,106
I was about to join my
father's camp and help him, actually.

61
00:04:00,223 --> 00:04:04,123
Help him? I guess you
just want to benefit from him.

62
00:04:04,705 --> 00:04:06,972
He's a congressman from the ruling party,

63
00:04:07,118 --> 00:04:10,638
so isn't taking advantage of his
influence what you're really after?

64
00:04:10,755 --> 00:04:12,756
If I'm allowed to, why not?

65
00:04:12,888 --> 00:04:14,670
This is what business
acumen is about, after all.

66
00:04:14,758 --> 00:04:16,452
Your father won't cut it.

67
00:04:16,555 --> 00:04:18,483
He has no ambition.

68
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:20,148
Think about it.

69
00:04:20,338 --> 00:04:25,982
What would you possibly get from someone
who acts as if a gold badge is all he needed?

70
00:04:26,094 --> 00:04:30,485
Then, what would you do for me instead?

71
00:04:30,663 --> 00:04:36,285
I will be soon nominated
as the new prime minister.

72
00:04:38,888 --> 00:04:41,783
If you bring Lee Seongmo to me,

73
00:04:42,066 --> 00:04:47,261
I'll give you everything your father can't.

74
00:04:49,716 --> 00:04:51,512
Let's have a drink.

75
00:05:21,155 --> 00:05:22,593
They taste great.

76
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:24,828
- How much is it?
- Two for 50,000 won.

77
00:05:24,989 --> 00:05:27,361
You like this, right?

78
00:05:27,507 --> 00:05:29,538
Look here.

79
00:05:55,124 --> 00:05:58,175
Are his conditions that bad?

80
00:05:58,321 --> 00:06:00,133
Enough not to remember a thing?

81
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:02,455
There's a bullet stuck in his head.

82
00:06:04,457 --> 00:06:06,678
Just being alive is a miracle.

83
00:06:07,755 --> 00:06:11,353
I've looked at the village office
and asked the realtor,

84
00:06:11,513 --> 00:06:14,093
and seems like they moved quite frequently.

85
00:06:14,571 --> 00:06:16,489
So there's a woman
looking after him, right?

86
00:06:16,591 --> 00:06:20,550
Yeah... On his hospital records,
it was listed as Hong Jisoo.

87
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:23,297
It's obvious that they
know they're being chased.

88
00:06:23,969 --> 00:06:27,409
So that's why they
were hiding their real address.

89
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:30,278
Who is that woman
and why is she helping him?

90
00:06:30,481 --> 00:06:31,534
A spy.

91
00:06:31,754 --> 00:06:33,229
Spy?!

92
00:06:33,346 --> 00:06:37,422
That colleague of Seongmo who
was exploited by Jo Pilyeon?

93
00:06:38,211 --> 00:06:40,052
I guess that's an alias.

94
00:06:40,988 --> 00:06:45,648
Because there is no one else
who could be looking after him.

95
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:51,923
Yes?

96
00:06:52,025 --> 00:06:53,383
It's me, Gangmo.

97
00:06:53,471 --> 00:06:55,531
Can we meet?

98
00:06:56,084 --> 00:06:57,912
I'm not in Seoul right now.

99
00:06:58,301 --> 00:06:59,943
Is it urgent?

100
00:07:00,469 --> 00:07:05,545
Seems like Jo Pilyeon might have
been chosen as our next prime minister.

101
00:07:06,129 --> 00:07:10,118
I was wondering if you could come
and discuss a solution with me.

102
00:07:11,111 --> 00:07:13,697
All right. I'll call you
again when I get there.

103
00:07:15,508 --> 00:07:17,787
I think I'll have to
go back to Seoul right now.

104
00:07:18,109 --> 00:07:19,374
You remain here.

105
00:07:20,465 --> 00:07:22,403
All right.

106
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:27,950
- How much for this?
- 10,000 won.

107
00:07:37,645 --> 00:07:38,906
Miju....

108
00:07:39,013 --> 00:07:41,168
Mi... Miju.

109
00:07:41,421 --> 00:07:43,069
Miju...

110
00:08:09,451 --> 00:08:10,686
What's wrong, Oppa?

111
00:08:10,776 --> 00:08:12,329
Get in the car.

112
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:14,286
I'll be right back.

113
00:08:18,011 --> 00:08:20,012
Ajeosshi!!

114
00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:22,803
Ajeosshi!

115
00:08:29,377 --> 00:08:31,507
Ajeosshi...

116
00:08:41,491 --> 00:08:44,651
What's the order this time?

117
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,193
Did Jo Pilyeon...

118
00:08:49,964 --> 00:08:54,510
tell you to find my brother and
get rid of him once and for all?

119
00:08:54,671 --> 00:08:57,038
I always thought this,

120
00:08:57,374 --> 00:09:01,815
but I can't still can't stand
how you just call him by name.

121
00:09:01,946 --> 00:09:05,222
Did he order you to kill him?

122
00:09:27,138 --> 00:09:28,594
Die!

123
00:09:31,558 --> 00:09:33,708
Oppa, don't!

124
00:09:33,796 --> 00:09:36,966
Don't do it... Don't!

125
00:09:43,598 --> 00:09:45,176
Listen well!

126
00:09:45,326 --> 00:09:48,069
Whatever you try,

127
00:09:49,135 --> 00:09:52,818
you'll never stop him!

128
00:10:00,722 --> 00:10:02,139
Go back...

129
00:10:02,417 --> 00:10:04,988
and convey my words to Jo Pilyeon.

130
00:10:05,543 --> 00:10:10,449
Tell him that as long
as Lee Gangmo is alive,

131
00:10:10,581 --> 00:10:15,372
he will never, ever gain what he wants.

132
00:10:15,825 --> 00:10:17,798
Because I will...

133
00:10:19,054 --> 00:10:26,737
I will force the most
miserable of downfalls on him.

134
00:10:43,096 --> 00:10:45,260
Ajeosshi...

135
00:10:55,918 --> 00:10:58,336
Ajeosshi.

136
00:11:20,104 --> 00:11:22,436
Ajeosshi...

137
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,790
Ajeosshi.

138
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,509
It's all right.

139
00:11:34,612 --> 00:11:36,964
It's me, Yeonsoo...

140
00:11:39,403 --> 00:11:41,346
It's all right.

141
00:11:46,277 --> 00:11:48,766
Let's go home.

142
00:11:54,772 --> 00:11:55,719
What?

143
00:11:55,814 --> 00:11:57,267
Lee Gangmo?

144
00:11:57,371 --> 00:12:01,942
He found out that
Lee Seongmo is in Sokcho.

145
00:12:02,113 --> 00:12:07,292
Looks like he'll bite me and
never let go like a rabid dog.

146
00:12:07,468 --> 00:12:09,016
We have no time to waste.

147
00:12:09,148 --> 00:12:14,455
Even if we send out all our men,
we must find Lee Seongmo at all cost.

148
00:12:14,569 --> 00:12:16,279
No need to worry.

149
00:12:16,389 --> 00:12:19,965
Hwang Jeongshik will take
care of our matter in Sokcho.

150
00:12:20,085 --> 00:12:21,631
You mean Hwang Taeseop's son?

151
00:12:21,729 --> 00:12:24,597
Seems like he's got
quite the clout in the area.

152
00:12:24,719 --> 00:12:26,553
If we leave it to him,
he'll take care of it in no time.

153
00:12:26,655 --> 00:12:29,037
But they say blood
is thicker than water.

154
00:12:29,212 --> 00:12:31,593
With Hwang Taeseop gritting
his teeth waiting to destroy you,

155
00:12:31,725 --> 00:12:34,172
how can you leave
something so crucial to his son?

156
00:12:34,413 --> 00:12:36,700
Ambition is
much thicker than blood.

157
00:12:36,832 --> 00:12:43,041
Not to mention that Hwang
Jeongshik still resents his father.

158
00:12:44,886 --> 00:12:48,954
But when will the new
cabinet be announced?

159
00:12:49,249 --> 00:12:50,871
This weekend.

160
00:12:50,988 --> 00:12:56,255
Then, will you be
nominated prime minister?

161
00:12:56,369 --> 00:12:58,407
It's already been decided.

162
00:12:58,656 --> 00:12:59,518
What?

163
00:12:59,752 --> 00:13:02,120
Only the announcement is left now.

164
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,573
Congratulations, Congressman!

165
00:13:08,307 --> 00:13:10,872
You've worked hard all this time, Jaechun.

166
00:13:10,982 --> 00:13:14,198
So... If there's anything you
want, don't hesitate to tell me.

167
00:13:14,304 --> 00:13:19,644
Just seeing you attain glory and
success is enough for me, Sir.

168
00:13:19,746 --> 00:13:23,457
I have no eyes for people with no ambition.

169
00:13:24,202 --> 00:13:27,970
Would a building in Gangnam do?

170
00:13:28,626 --> 00:13:30,187
Congressman...

171
00:13:30,424 --> 00:13:33,916
Fame is all fine and dandy, but growing
old without money will only bring you misery.

172
00:13:34,062 --> 00:13:35,600
Just accept it.

173
00:13:35,692 --> 00:13:36,999
Then...

174
00:13:37,752 --> 00:13:39,891
I will gladly accept it.

175
00:13:42,066 --> 00:13:47,793
If Hwang Jeongshik finds Lee Seongmo,
everything will be solved.

176
00:13:48,531 --> 00:13:52,439
Nobody will be able to stop us.

177
00:14:12,167 --> 00:14:14,482
How did it go?

178
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,448
The rumors are true.

179
00:14:17,901 --> 00:14:21,816
Jo Pilyeon will be announced
as the next prime minister.

180
00:14:22,386 --> 00:14:27,572
Then, are you telling us that
there is no way to stop him now?

181
00:14:27,674 --> 00:14:34,691
There are rumblings in the opposition
to motion for a special cabinet hearing.

182
00:14:34,822 --> 00:14:37,858
A special cabinet hearing?

183
00:14:38,204 --> 00:14:40,096
Is there any chance to make this reality?

184
00:14:40,228 --> 00:14:43,281
Considering all the rumors about
the former president's secret fund,

185
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:46,982
many people in congress
still find Jo Pilyeon's behavior suspect.

186
00:14:47,084 --> 00:14:49,319
If all the former opposition members
who joined the ruling party through...

187
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:51,394
the 3-party merger join forces with them,

188
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:53,716
then there will be no
way for Jo to avoid that hearing.

189
00:14:53,863 --> 00:14:57,573
That cabinet hearing is our very last chance.

190
00:14:57,719 --> 00:15:01,693
But we're still dealing with a cabinet hearing.

191
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:04,255
Unless he's accused of
critical wrongdoings,

192
00:15:04,372 --> 00:15:07,040
it will be hard to revoke his nomination.

193
00:15:07,154 --> 00:15:10,723
If this hearing does take
place, when will it happen?

194
00:15:10,831 --> 00:15:15,724
Since they'll have to form a special
committee made of congressmen,

195
00:15:15,972 --> 00:15:18,222
I guess early next month?

196
00:15:18,719 --> 00:15:23,527
I'll volunteer for the committee
and help bring him down.

197
00:15:23,819 --> 00:15:25,134
You will?

198
00:15:25,221 --> 00:15:32,774
Is there any other congressman
who knows Jo Pilyeon as well as I do?

199
00:15:34,688 --> 00:15:36,374
Fine.

200
00:15:36,687 --> 00:15:38,543
Let's give it a try.

201
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:40,427
Gangmo.

202
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:43,890
Can you find Seongmo
before that hearing begins?

203
00:15:44,021 --> 00:15:45,993
I must find him.

204
00:15:46,183 --> 00:15:50,785
Whatever it takes, I will.

205
00:15:51,549 --> 00:15:53,595
A cabinet hearing?!

206
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:56,416
Whose idea is that?

207
00:15:56,562 --> 00:15:59,017
That's not the issue.

208
00:15:59,241 --> 00:16:01,997
The chairman of this
special committee is Min Honggi.

209
00:16:02,187 --> 00:16:03,193
What?!

210
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:04,397
Min Honggi?

211
00:16:04,484 --> 00:16:08,477
And Hwang Taeseop already
volunteered to participate.

212
00:16:08,585 --> 00:16:10,208
If you add the opposition party,

213
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:15,480
out of 13 members in total, the
majority will be there to attack you.

214
00:16:15,845 --> 00:16:19,352
Seems like you'll have to take
very strong countermeasures, Sir.

215
00:16:20,194 --> 00:16:24,114
Get your hands on the
list of committee members.

216
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,866
What for?

217
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:28,744
We still have enough time.

218
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:31,213
We can just convince
them to jump ship.

219
00:16:31,563 --> 00:16:33,813
Get yourself a seat in there as well.

220
00:16:33,989 --> 00:16:36,881
It will be hard for me.

221
00:16:37,144 --> 00:16:39,555
I was already assigned to the special
committee for the minister of defense.

222
00:16:39,628 --> 00:16:41,193
Look, Congressman Oh.

223
00:16:41,299 --> 00:16:46,510
Have we already forgotten who bought
you that golden badge of yours?

224
00:16:47,307 --> 00:16:50,235
You said the hearing will last a day, right?

225
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:53,654
If I can get through that day,

226
00:16:55,963 --> 00:17:01,358
I will become prime minister.

227
00:17:12,066 --> 00:17:15,049
Sorry for not calling
you more often, Mom.

228
00:17:15,266 --> 00:17:17,241
Is Wooju...

229
00:17:17,335 --> 00:17:19,358
Let me talk to him.

230
00:17:21,929 --> 00:17:23,611
Wooju!

231
00:17:23,718 --> 00:17:26,736
It's Mommy.
Yeah...

232
00:17:27,789 --> 00:17:29,965
How are you?

233
00:17:30,882 --> 00:17:32,709
The art class?

234
00:17:32,813 --> 00:17:35,400
Then draw me a
portrait and then send it.

235
00:17:35,634 --> 00:17:39,008
Let's see how good you've become.

236
00:17:39,987 --> 00:17:42,062
All right.

237
00:17:43,274 --> 00:17:46,542
I miss you, too.

238
00:17:47,103 --> 00:17:49,212
Soojeong, the director is here.

239
00:17:49,338 --> 00:17:52,366
Wooju, I'll call you later.

240
00:17:52,455 --> 00:17:56,081
All right.
I love you, Wooju.

241
00:18:04,418 --> 00:18:07,678
We're not doing scene 42,
we'll just start from scene 27, so get ready.

242
00:18:07,772 --> 00:18:08,485
Yes, Director.

243
00:18:08,573 --> 00:18:11,657
- Remember the right costumes.
- Yes.

244
00:18:12,172 --> 00:18:13,146
Right...

245
00:18:13,306 --> 00:18:14,871
By the way, Director.

246
00:18:14,996 --> 00:18:18,152
Is Sunny Film the main investor, again?

247
00:18:18,824 --> 00:18:21,979
Looks like their president
is a huge fan of yours.

248
00:18:22,126 --> 00:18:25,030
They've invested in my films for years already,

249
00:18:25,155 --> 00:18:26,888
I was just wondering if I could meet him.

250
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:32,177
I don't really know... He's away on
business abroad, so he'll be busy.

251
00:18:38,465 --> 00:18:40,642
- Production/Investment -
Sunny Films

252
00:18:52,007 --> 00:18:54,571
You want a five billion loan?

253
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,040
We have no time.

254
00:18:56,147 --> 00:19:00,315
- The four billion you added...
- Have I ever failed...

255
00:19:00,475 --> 00:19:02,495
to pay our interests on time?

256
00:19:02,974 --> 00:19:05,540
Not even once.

257
00:19:06,423 --> 00:19:08,703
I'm busy, so let's
wrap this up quickly.

258
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:13,227
Miss Choi? Bring me that
data about Manbo Group.

259
00:19:18,643 --> 00:19:20,663
Here it is, Chairman.

260
00:19:24,894 --> 00:19:27,361
I see we've got quite
a few bank loans here?!

261
00:19:27,621 --> 00:19:32,177
Not to mention that
Manbo Plaza is your collateral.

262
00:19:32,567 --> 00:19:34,562
Will you do it, or not?

263
00:19:34,828 --> 00:19:39,466
What's the reason you still haven't
completed those apartments in Ilsan?

264
00:19:39,571 --> 00:19:42,954
I didn't come here for business advice.

265
00:19:47,923 --> 00:19:53,322
You'll have to forgive me, but
there will be no additional loans.

266
00:19:56,517 --> 00:19:57,704
Hey... Hwang Jeongyeon.

267
00:19:57,774 --> 00:20:03,602
With finances in this state, would
you be able to pay on time?

268
00:20:04,364 --> 00:20:06,749
So you've had your cake and that's it...

269
00:20:06,855 --> 00:20:08,065
Look at me.

270
00:20:08,147 --> 00:20:11,154
You're talking to Manbo Group,
fighting for the top of the sector!

271
00:20:11,248 --> 00:20:12,751
I know.

272
00:20:14,036 --> 00:20:20,468
You should have taken better care
of what you so despicably stole from me.

273
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,802
Miss Choi.

274
00:20:24,967 --> 00:20:29,201
Check their loan terms and make sure
they don't miss payments by a single day.

275
00:20:29,318 --> 00:20:31,198
All right, Chairman.

276
00:20:43,567 --> 00:20:44,801
This is serious, Chairman.

277
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:48,407
Where are we going to
find those five billion now?

278
00:20:48,653 --> 00:20:53,669
I'll start by canceling Sunny
Film's investment projects.

279
00:20:55,478 --> 00:20:57,404
Go ahead with those
film projects as planned.

280
00:20:57,501 --> 00:20:58,196
Chairman.

281
00:20:58,290 --> 00:20:59,946
We'll just have to make that money.

282
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:03,106
But your father is asking for it right now.

283
00:21:03,282 --> 00:21:05,737
Anyhow, our film investment...

284
00:21:21,465 --> 00:21:24,747
What is a famous movie
star like you doing here?

285
00:21:26,808 --> 00:21:29,040
Should have seen your film at least once,

286
00:21:29,165 --> 00:21:31,748
but I really have no time for that these days.

287
00:21:32,418 --> 00:21:35,762
Whenever I can, I'll go see it.

288
00:21:58,851 --> 00:22:01,377
Come in, Miju.

289
00:22:02,563 --> 00:22:04,149
Any news of your brother?

290
00:22:04,316 --> 00:22:07,990
Nothing new yet.

291
00:22:10,351 --> 00:22:11,808
How about Gangmo?

292
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:17,315
These days he's completely
focused on finding Seongmo.

293
00:22:49,676 --> 00:22:52,105
That's not what your
sleek image suggested.

294
00:22:52,211 --> 00:22:55,124
Feels more like a dorm in here.

295
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:12,479
Even if you have to hire
more people to find him, don't stop.

296
00:23:13,634 --> 00:23:15,098
We have no time, Shideok.

297
00:23:15,333 --> 00:23:18,722
We must find him
before the cabinet hearing.

298
00:23:18,828 --> 00:23:20,388
Don't worry.

299
00:23:20,677 --> 00:23:24,852
We're not going back to Seoul
until we find Seongmo Hyung.

300
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,036
All right.

301
00:23:28,763 --> 00:23:30,434
What do you mean?

302
00:23:30,544 --> 00:23:32,836
You're just going to live here?

303
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:35,325
So let's hurry up and find him.

304
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:39,342
Ahh... I miss my wife and kids
so much, I can't take it anymore.

305
00:23:39,483 --> 00:23:41,562
Get out of the way.

306
00:23:50,154 --> 00:23:51,376
Baby?

307
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:53,866
It's me, Sotae.

308
00:23:54,418 --> 00:23:57,510
{\a6}[literally *first male **second male]

309
00:23:54,418 --> 00:23:57,510
I see... How about Ilnam* and Yinam**?

310
00:23:57,721 --> 00:23:58,672
They're playing?

311
00:23:58,778 --> 00:24:01,351
But I miss you so much...
It's driving me insane.

312
00:24:01,445 --> 00:24:02,960
What's wrong with me?

313
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:07,423
This is so corny I can't bear to listen.

314
00:24:07,517 --> 00:24:11,173
If it's corny, get out of here
and spare yourself the spectacle.

315
00:24:11,244 --> 00:24:12,747
As if you weren't curious...

316
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:16,910
{\a6}[*slang for goosebumps]

317
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:16,910
Hello? Nah...
Your brother has chicken flesh*.

318
00:24:17,035 --> 00:24:18,433
Chicken flesh?

319
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:21,378
Ohh... I suddenly feel
like eating chicken!

320
00:24:21,448 --> 00:24:23,703
Chicken?
Eat it, then.

321
00:24:23,797 --> 00:24:26,840
You're pregnant, so you should
eat whatever you want.

322
00:24:27,577 --> 00:24:29,870
I went to the hospital earlier on,

323
00:24:29,999 --> 00:24:31,291
and they say this time it's a girl.

324
00:24:31,385 --> 00:24:36,375
- Aigoo... Our son-in-law is a stallion!
- The hell are you saying! The kids will hear you...

325
00:24:36,774 --> 00:24:39,194
Aigoo... Ilnam, eat this.

326
00:24:39,276 --> 00:24:41,870
Want some milk, Yinam?

327
00:24:41,962 --> 00:24:46,077
But, since it's a girl,
what do we call her?

328
00:24:46,277 --> 00:24:48,287
{\a6}[*lit. third one]

329
00:24:46,277 --> 00:24:48,287
Samsoon*?!

330
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,707
Don't know... It is easy on the ears...

331
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:52,104
That's nice, uh?

332
00:24:52,198 --> 00:24:54,289
Ilnam, Yinam, Samsoon.

333
00:24:54,348 --> 00:24:58,409
{\a6}[*lit. fifth one]

334
00:24:54,348 --> 00:24:58,409
- Go all the way to Ohsoon*.
- Aigoo! Want to make a baseball team?

335
00:24:58,496 --> 00:25:01,038
As if you were doing all the hard work.

336
00:25:05,812 --> 00:25:08,125
Keep quiet, will you?

337
00:25:09,442 --> 00:25:11,580
Nah... Go ahead...

338
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:14,520
I miss you...

339
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,366
Jeongyeon.

340
00:25:36,988 --> 00:25:38,698
You're back?

341
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:39,637
Hungry, aren't you?

342
00:25:39,731 --> 00:25:41,082
Come have dinner.

343
00:25:41,352 --> 00:25:43,186
How did you get in here?

344
00:25:44,841 --> 00:25:47,214
I asked Miju to give me the keys.

345
00:25:47,308 --> 00:25:50,796
She was worried about you.

346
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:58,012
Let's eat.
I'm hungry, too.

347
00:26:10,726 --> 00:26:13,017
I remember back in the day...

348
00:26:14,238 --> 00:26:17,633
I cooked for you once in the past.

349
00:26:18,439 --> 00:26:23,491
Remember how salty
that stew you made was?

350
00:26:23,951 --> 00:26:25,766
Right, it was.

351
00:26:26,729 --> 00:26:30,159
And you still ate it all
without saying a thing.

352
00:26:31,966 --> 00:26:37,369
It was so long ago,
but it still feels like yesterday.

353
00:26:39,794 --> 00:26:41,492
Have you seen?

354
00:26:42,153 --> 00:26:45,700
From here on in,
Hwang Jeongyeon is mine.

355
00:26:54,739 --> 00:26:56,506
I, Lee Gangmo,

356
00:26:56,776 --> 00:27:02,730
join Hwang Jeongyeon
in marriage here and now.

357
00:27:04,473 --> 00:27:06,771
I have nothing to give her,

358
00:27:07,624 --> 00:27:11,029
but I'll love her more
than anyone in the world.

359
00:27:12,932 --> 00:27:19,181
May you watch over us,
and help me give her happiness.

360
00:27:37,129 --> 00:27:38,973
What are you thinking about?

361
00:27:42,051 --> 00:27:45,023
What were you thinking
about, to get so surprised?

362
00:27:46,045 --> 00:27:47,924
It's nothing.

363
00:27:50,551 --> 00:27:51,726
You...

364
00:27:52,867 --> 00:27:55,367
have become a lot better at this.

365
00:27:57,129 --> 00:27:58,562
It's really good.

366
00:27:58,891 --> 00:28:00,301
Great.

367
00:28:01,898 --> 00:28:03,499
Gangmo.

368
00:28:04,603 --> 00:28:06,846
Do you have time tomorrow?

369
00:28:07,868 --> 00:28:14,211
People who were part of our
organization opened a business in Sokcho.

370
00:28:15,034 --> 00:28:18,907
Their specialty is finding missing people.

371
00:28:19,236 --> 00:28:20,129
Jeongyeon...

372
00:28:20,234 --> 00:28:24,733
If your brother is there,
I'm sure they'll find him.

373
00:28:25,415 --> 00:28:27,447
Leave it to me, Gangmo.

374
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:33,603
What are you trying to say?

375
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,105
I told you I needed the money today!

376
00:28:36,187 --> 00:28:38,574
I'm doing everything in my power,
so give me a little more time.

377
00:28:38,684 --> 00:28:42,013
How many times do I have to
tell you that there is no time?

378
00:28:42,271 --> 00:28:44,522
Before the cabinet hearing begins,

379
00:28:44,651 --> 00:28:47,247
I must buy that committee's favors.

380
00:28:47,435 --> 00:28:50,043
Think that money will just
pour out like water from a tap?

381
00:28:50,125 --> 00:28:53,778
If nothing else works, then just
sell Manbo Plaza and get it over with!

382
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,011
The finish line is near, Minwoo.

383
00:29:02,082 --> 00:29:04,595
Money is not the issue.

384
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:11,047
The day when the entire world
will be at the tip of your fingers is coming.

385
00:29:14,078 --> 00:29:16,298
Just keep going.

386
00:29:16,509 --> 00:29:18,060
If you stop the pedal,

387
00:29:18,118 --> 00:29:20,620
then the bicycle is only going to fall.

388
00:29:20,797 --> 00:29:22,751
Are we clear, son?

389
00:29:22,916 --> 00:29:25,206
I'll get you that money by tomorrow.

390
00:29:25,918 --> 00:29:29,752
Don't you ever
break your promises again.

391
00:29:42,324 --> 00:29:48,085
Take five billion from the
Manbo Plaza construction budget.

392
00:29:49,692 --> 00:29:52,609
That would be embezzlement of public funds.

393
00:29:52,688 --> 00:29:53,970
So?

394
00:29:54,064 --> 00:29:56,556
Are you going to press charges?

395
00:29:56,665 --> 00:29:58,034
Chairman!

396
00:29:58,168 --> 00:30:02,735
I can't stop this anymore, either.

397
00:30:02,841 --> 00:30:06,666
Then, are you going
to delay the construction?

398
00:30:06,765 --> 00:30:10,981
No, speed it up.

399
00:30:11,095 --> 00:30:13,424
What are you trying to accomplish?

400
00:30:13,929 --> 00:30:18,458
I'll deal with it, so just
proceed as instructed!

401
00:30:24,388 --> 00:30:25,842
Come on in, Chairman.

402
00:30:25,947 --> 00:30:28,522
He's Chairman Lee Gangmo
of Hangang Construction.

403
00:30:28,592 --> 00:30:31,270
Nice to meet you,
my name is Go Bongshik.

404
00:30:31,341 --> 00:30:32,926
Nice to meet you, I'm Lee Gangmo.

405
00:30:33,114 --> 00:30:35,076
- I'm Kim Wooshik.
- It's a pleasure.

406
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,331
Come on in, President Hwang.

407
00:30:37,837 --> 00:30:39,575
Say Hi.

408
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,531
Here's Chairman Hwang
Jeongyeon of Happy Bank,

409
00:30:43,624 --> 00:30:47,207
and Chairman Lee Gangmo
of Hangang Construction.

410
00:30:49,251 --> 00:30:52,845
Nice to meet you, I'm Hwang Jeongshik.

411
00:30:53,201 --> 00:30:56,571
So you're going to open a resort here?

412
00:30:56,670 --> 00:31:00,437
I feel it every time I come,
but the scenery here is just fabulous.

413
00:31:00,662 --> 00:31:03,621
Once the highway gets here,
it will become a major tourist attraction.

414
00:31:03,867 --> 00:31:08,642
How much do you plan
to invest in the project?

415
00:31:15,572 --> 00:31:17,828
Find this man for us.

416
00:31:22,126 --> 00:31:24,985
So you're positive that he's here?

417
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:26,707
We're sure.

418
00:31:27,048 --> 00:31:29,958
It's really urgent, so please try
to find him as soon as possible.

419
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:34,303
We'll discuss our investment
projects after you find him.

420
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:35,936
I'm sure that's okay with you?

421
00:31:36,018 --> 00:31:37,321
Fine.

422
00:31:37,444 --> 00:31:41,516
We'll do our best to find him right away.

423
00:31:42,538 --> 00:31:45,298
The government announced
its fourth cabinet selection.

424
00:31:45,498 --> 00:31:48,022
Chairman of the Korean Policy
Development Committee Jo Pilyeon....

425
00:31:48,133 --> 00:31:50,778
has been announced as candidate
for the seat of prime minister.

426
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:54,126
With a past in the army's
intelligence department,

427
00:31:54,255 --> 00:31:56,247
Jo joined the 12th legislature as congressman,

428
00:31:56,352 --> 00:32:00,443
and is renowned for combining
boldness with determination.

429
00:32:00,547 --> 00:32:04,673
But over a hundred
congressmen from both parties...

430
00:32:04,908 --> 00:32:08,338
filed a motion requesting a cabinet
hearing regarding this reshuffle.

431
00:32:08,724 --> 00:32:10,029
Ajeosshi!

432
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,862
What's the matter?

433
00:32:11,979 --> 00:32:14,019
What's going on?

434
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:26,440
It's all right... Everything's fine...

435
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:56,737
It's a true honor to have you here tonight.

436
00:32:56,842 --> 00:32:59,650
The cabinet hearing is
right around the corner,

437
00:32:59,744 --> 00:33:04,771
I wonder if Jo Pilyeon's son
should really meet us this way.

438
00:33:04,947 --> 00:33:07,433
I'm the one who arranged all this.

439
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:10,060
If it made you uncomfortable,
allow me to apologize.

440
00:33:10,225 --> 00:33:11,822
That's not what I meant,

441
00:33:11,893 --> 00:33:13,925
it's just that people
have eyes to see, you know...

442
00:33:14,042 --> 00:33:18,929
If he learns of this meeting,
my father will angrily reproach me.

443
00:33:19,968 --> 00:33:23,245
Since we're here, I'll be honest with you.

444
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:29,917
I'd like you to help out my
father at the upcoming hearing.

445
00:33:31,456 --> 00:33:35,474
It's something the president already decided upon,

446
00:33:35,582 --> 00:33:37,885
so why would we oppose it?

447
00:33:37,979 --> 00:33:41,121
Thank you, Congressman Park.
Here...

448
00:33:41,384 --> 00:33:44,679
Let's have a drink.

449
00:33:51,607 --> 00:33:53,327
Are they all gone?

450
00:33:53,613 --> 00:33:54,760
Yes.

451
00:33:55,235 --> 00:33:57,321
Hwang Taeseop didn't come?

452
00:33:57,544 --> 00:33:59,564
Weren't you expecting that?

453
00:34:00,257 --> 00:34:04,674
Guess he must be
preparing to bring me down.

454
00:34:04,879 --> 00:34:07,599
Isn't it a little too early to
give up trying to convince him?

455
00:34:07,768 --> 00:34:10,887
You want me to ask
Hwang Taeseop for help?

456
00:34:10,991 --> 00:34:13,752
If there's anyone who can be
swayed by power, that's politicians.

457
00:34:13,917 --> 00:34:16,055
You've been proclaimed prime minister,

458
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,745
so there's no way he would take this to the end.

459
00:34:19,379 --> 00:34:22,813
You do have a point.

460
00:34:24,383 --> 00:34:28,284
Try to approach
Hwang Taeseop as well, then.

461
00:34:28,883 --> 00:34:30,141
All right.

462
00:34:30,373 --> 00:34:35,473
You must be prepared for the
possibility that they might not find him.

463
00:34:36,184 --> 00:34:37,891
Should that be the case,

464
00:34:38,016 --> 00:34:42,905
we'll have to stake everything
on that cabinet hearing.

465
00:34:43,011 --> 00:34:45,057
I'll prepare all the data for the hearing.

466
00:34:45,174 --> 00:34:47,559
If you need any witness, I will do it.

467
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:53,313
Right... Do it yourselves
without any aide's help.

468
00:34:54,151 --> 00:34:56,143
This way, please.

469
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,349
Careful.

470
00:34:58,443 --> 00:35:00,255
Leave it here.

471
00:35:04,378 --> 00:35:05,991
What's this?

472
00:35:15,259 --> 00:35:17,775
What the hell is this about?

473
00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:21,329
It's by Robert Mann,
he's a very famous painter.

474
00:35:21,435 --> 00:35:23,378
Must be really expensive?

475
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:27,019
It would sell for at least
100,000 dollars in New York.

476
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,356
What... 100,000 dollars?

477
00:35:31,128 --> 00:35:33,277
That much money for this painting?

478
00:35:33,383 --> 00:35:34,945
And who sent it?

479
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:39,585
Even the courier
didn't know the sender.

480
00:35:40,032 --> 00:35:42,701
I don't really know if I can accept this.

481
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:48,381
I think a guest might visit you very soon.

482
00:35:48,534 --> 00:35:50,829
A guest?

483
00:36:01,088 --> 00:36:01,969
Yes.

484
00:36:02,075 --> 00:36:03,708
Hwang Taeseop speaking.

485
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:07,020
It's been a while, Congressman Hwang.

486
00:36:14,053 --> 00:36:17,061
What is all this data?

487
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,271
Tell me about it...

488
00:36:18,365 --> 00:36:21,325
If we need to go
through this all, it'll kill us...

489
00:36:21,466 --> 00:36:22,958
Shall we get started?

490
00:36:23,134 --> 00:36:25,982
We'll have to first classify
them by content, right?

491
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:33,785
So you sent me that painting?

492
00:36:34,784 --> 00:36:36,486
It was hard to get my hands on it...

493
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:38,835
Why, you don't like it?

494
00:36:39,939 --> 00:36:43,627
The world must have really changed.

495
00:36:44,908 --> 00:36:52,850
The sight of me groveling at your feet and
throwing money at you feels like yesterday...

496
00:36:53,155 --> 00:36:57,169
Now you're the one sending me that...

497
00:36:57,296 --> 00:37:03,171
I came here to bury the
hatchet, Congressman Hwang.

498
00:37:04,906 --> 00:37:06,814
What is politics, after all?

499
00:37:06,934 --> 00:37:13,413
Isn't it all about using people
to help you gain more power?

500
00:37:14,177 --> 00:37:17,113
Why don't you get to the point, then?

501
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:22,058
You can use me for real, this time.

502
00:37:22,328 --> 00:37:24,220
If I become premier,

503
00:37:24,337 --> 00:37:28,425
your path to success
will be like a walk in the park.

504
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:35,998
So you're asking me to be on your
side at the upcoming cabinet hearing.

505
00:37:36,303 --> 00:37:42,463
At a time like this, the
both of us need political allies.

506
00:37:43,402 --> 00:37:45,552
That's interesting.

507
00:37:47,925 --> 00:37:52,482
But, you know... While those
who hit might not remember,

508
00:37:52,705 --> 00:37:55,716
the ones who get hit always
seem to recall quite clearly.

509
00:37:55,842 --> 00:37:59,990
Dwell in the past and you'll
never evolve, Congressman Hwang.

510
00:38:00,154 --> 00:38:04,442
Let's only think about
the future ahead of us.

511
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:06,486
Fine.

512
00:38:06,932 --> 00:38:08,904
That's all fine with me...

513
00:38:09,022 --> 00:38:11,597
But there's one little
issue getting in the way.

514
00:38:11,707 --> 00:38:13,544
Tell me.

515
00:38:17,361 --> 00:38:21,629
Let's speak our hearts
out and make a fresh start.

516
00:38:21,742 --> 00:38:27,578
Have you forgotten
that you once tried to kill me?

517
00:38:29,692 --> 00:38:33,004
What are you saying, Congressman Hwang?

518
00:38:33,284 --> 00:38:35,658
I remember clearly what you told me,

519
00:38:35,976 --> 00:38:41,226
right as I was on the brink of death.

520
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,859
Are you starting to understand now?

521
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,195
What the price
to pay for betraying me is.

522
00:38:58,325 --> 00:39:01,055
Take a good look, Chairman Hwang.

523
00:39:01,772 --> 00:39:07,480
At how my son Minwoo devours Manbo
Construction while you're not around.

524
00:39:24,623 --> 00:39:29,650
Do you even know why I entered politics?

525
00:39:29,989 --> 00:39:31,400
Power?!

526
00:39:31,564 --> 00:39:34,137
I don't need any of that!

527
00:39:34,383 --> 00:39:38,577
I only did it to deal
with you once and for all!

528
00:39:38,671 --> 00:39:43,200
Congressman Hwang...
There must be a misunderstanding here.

529
00:39:57,281 --> 00:39:59,137
Take a good look.

530
00:39:59,959 --> 00:40:04,094
This is what awaits you.

531
00:40:04,493 --> 00:40:09,193
I will destroy you with
my own hands, Jo Pilyeon!

532
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,472
Still as foolish as ever...

533
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:17,721
We'll soon find out who
ends up like that painting.

534
00:40:27,893 --> 00:40:31,737
You want to increase
the theater's seating to 500?

535
00:40:31,848 --> 00:40:37,006
I want to make Manbo Plaza's
theater the best in the country.

536
00:40:37,116 --> 00:40:38,101
But, Chairman.

537
00:40:38,206 --> 00:40:39,992
With all the structural
changes we already made,

538
00:40:40,086 --> 00:40:42,115
the load will be unbearable.

539
00:40:42,217 --> 00:40:44,385
When are you ever going to complete it,
if you keep worrying about that?

540
00:40:44,467 --> 00:40:46,599
Because of those lobbying funds,

541
00:40:46,693 --> 00:40:50,522
we had to use 23 inch pillars
instead of the 32 inch ones we needed.

542
00:40:50,628 --> 00:40:53,048
- And that's not the end of it...
- Director Moon!

543
00:40:54,446 --> 00:40:56,601
Just complete construction, for starters.

544
00:40:56,717 --> 00:40:58,627
All the aspects we
sacrificed for lack of funds...

545
00:40:58,757 --> 00:41:02,123
will be addressed after my
father becomes prime minister.

546
00:41:02,276 --> 00:41:04,238
Is that clear?

547
00:41:05,273 --> 00:41:11,626
Are you that obsessed with this
theater just because of Cha Soojeong?

548
00:41:14,933 --> 00:41:16,495
It's for my sake.

549
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:20,102
Because it's what I want.

550
00:41:22,357 --> 00:41:24,424
You were here.

551
00:41:24,765 --> 00:41:26,489
How did it go with Congressman Hwang?

552
00:41:26,605 --> 00:41:30,284
That fool declared war
on me right in my face.

553
00:41:30,507 --> 00:41:33,596
Lee Gangmo won't just sit
back and watch at the hearing.

554
00:41:33,702 --> 00:41:35,605
Unless Lee Seongmo shows up,

555
00:41:35,722 --> 00:41:39,620
he won't be able to do much,
but he'll surely help Hwang Taeseop.

556
00:41:39,784 --> 00:41:43,132
Then, is it war?

557
00:41:43,285 --> 00:41:47,326
So you'll have to help me.

558
00:41:50,297 --> 00:41:53,950
What kind of questions do you think
the hearing committee will focus on?

559
00:41:54,067 --> 00:41:57,929
Considering Congressman
Oh Byeongtak's secret report...

560
00:41:58,038 --> 00:41:59,353
That's right.

561
00:41:59,494 --> 00:42:03,231
They'll focus on our connection
with the private lending cartel.

562
00:42:03,356 --> 00:42:08,024
And my father's past political
actions will be added to the plate as well.

563
00:42:08,165 --> 00:42:12,640
I want over a thousand possible
questions for every single scenario.

564
00:42:12,804 --> 00:42:18,360
Select three hundred questions
most likely to be asked, and create a questionnaire.

565
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:26,061
This sums up the connection
between Noh Gapsoo and Jo Pilyeon.

566
00:42:26,542 --> 00:42:28,551
How about the data
involving Manbo Construction?

567
00:42:28,668 --> 00:42:30,407
We're almost done
with their tax situation.

568
00:42:30,489 --> 00:42:31,576
How about the construction committee?

569
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:34,254
It's quite complicated,
so it may take some time.

570
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:35,593
If we want to bring Jo Pilyeon down,

571
00:42:35,663 --> 00:42:38,295
we must get a hold of
even the slightest blunder.

572
00:42:39,927 --> 00:42:41,823
Any news from Sokcho?

573
00:42:41,947 --> 00:42:43,800
They say they're still looking for him,

574
00:42:43,909 --> 00:42:46,436
but looks like there were no
particular developments.

575
00:42:46,627 --> 00:42:48,519
Timing is the problem.

576
00:42:49,058 --> 00:42:53,664
We must find him
before the hearing is over.

577
00:42:57,438 --> 00:42:58,511
Here...

578
00:43:05,502 --> 00:43:07,322
Is it good, Ajeosshi?

579
00:43:08,755 --> 00:43:13,515
Have some stew, too.
This is really good.

580
00:43:20,737 --> 00:43:22,505
Sorry, Ajeosshi.

581
00:43:22,623 --> 00:43:23,699
Are you all right?

582
00:43:23,769 --> 00:43:25,624
Did you get burned?

583
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:34,211
I wish you could say my name just once.

584
00:43:34,869 --> 00:43:37,755
"It's all right, Yeonsoo..."

585
00:43:37,878 --> 00:43:39,502
Like that.

586
00:43:41,873 --> 00:43:44,847
I... It's...

587
00:43:45,094 --> 00:43:46,762
all right... It's...

588
00:43:46,844 --> 00:43:48,892
It's all... right.

589
00:43:51,042 --> 00:43:52,217
Yeonsoo.

590
00:43:52,393 --> 00:43:54,449
Ji Yeonsoo.

591
00:43:54,585 --> 00:43:56,412
Go ahead and say it.

592
00:43:56,525 --> 00:43:58,137
Yeonsoo...

593
00:43:58,266 --> 00:44:02,627
Mi... Miju...

594
00:44:05,611 --> 00:44:07,302
Again Miju?

595
00:44:07,466 --> 00:44:09,992
Finish eating by yourself.

596
00:44:34,215 --> 00:44:35,825
Here.

597
00:44:50,434 --> 00:44:53,119
I love you, Ajeosshi.

598
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:57,763
Even if you don't like me,

599
00:44:58,094 --> 00:45:01,756
I will love you more
than anyone in the world.

600
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,358
You're going to go on the
offensive against Jo Pilyeon,

601
00:48:24,458 --> 00:48:25,718
what will you focus on?

602
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:26,881
We'll talk later.

603
00:48:26,963 --> 00:48:31,714
- Any other issue other than this?
- Later. I'll talk later.

604
00:48:32,428 --> 00:48:34,889
Are you ready?

605
00:48:35,002 --> 00:48:39,043
I did my very best,
so let's just go for it.

606
00:48:40,023 --> 00:48:41,320
Chairman Lee.

607
00:48:41,413 --> 00:48:44,252
- Sir.
- Good job.

608
00:48:49,576 --> 00:48:51,713
First, our congratulations.

609
00:48:51,819 --> 00:48:53,663
What do you think about
people expressing their surprise...

610
00:48:53,746 --> 00:48:56,335
for your nomination as new prime minister?

611
00:48:56,488 --> 00:48:57,709
Yes...

612
00:48:57,874 --> 00:49:04,616
I think there's a good reason why
the president chose me as prime minister.

613
00:49:04,804 --> 00:49:06,226
Several rumors have been spread,

614
00:49:06,308 --> 00:49:09,438
tell us your feelings about this cabinet hearing.

615
00:49:09,508 --> 00:49:12,257
I pride myself on having
devoted my entire life...

616
00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:17,446
for the sake of this country and our people.

617
00:49:18,048 --> 00:49:22,361
And that is why I hope this hearing will
help put those groundless rumors to sleep,

618
00:49:22,467 --> 00:49:27,436
and reveal the truth once and for all.

619
00:49:52,098 --> 00:49:57,866
We will now begin the cabinet
hearing for the prime minister.

620
00:50:02,264 --> 00:50:07,012
First, we'll have
the official candidate's oath.

621
00:50:07,106 --> 00:50:10,641
I now ask the candidate to raise
his right hand and recite the oath,

622
00:50:10,712 --> 00:50:13,660
after which he will sign
and seal the pledge,

623
00:50:13,742 --> 00:50:17,385
and present it to the
chairman of the committee.

624
00:50:21,590 --> 00:50:24,022
Oath.

625
00:50:24,891 --> 00:50:27,452
As the official candidate,

626
00:50:27,593 --> 00:50:36,377
I swear to tell the whole truth and
nothing but the truth, so help me God.

627
00:50:36,672 --> 00:50:43,689
March 6, 1992.
Official candidate, Jo Pilyeon.

628
00:50:59,302 --> 00:51:04,165
Next, we will hear the official
candidate's opening speech.

629
00:51:04,409 --> 00:51:08,435
Candidate, you are kindly encouraged
to keep your speech under ten minutes.

630
00:51:17,013 --> 00:51:21,612
Esteemed Chairman Min Honggi.

631
00:51:22,323 --> 00:51:25,471
And gentlemen of the committee.

632
00:51:25,859 --> 00:51:32,260
I stand before you today as official
candidate for prime minister,

633
00:51:32,437 --> 00:51:35,309
a privilege I was
honored to be bestowed with.

634
00:51:35,726 --> 00:51:41,658
I also must extend my sincerest gratitude
to the committee members who took time...

635
00:51:41,799 --> 00:51:49,818
out of their busy schedules to be here.

636
00:51:50,093 --> 00:51:53,272
Should I be proclaimed prime minister,

637
00:51:53,742 --> 00:51:59,885
I would devote my every effort,
regardless of partisan affiliation...

638
00:52:12,831 --> 00:52:17,797
So I hear you're cutting corners
to fund your father's lobbying?

639
00:52:17,973 --> 00:52:20,616
Still engaging in
flights of fancy, I see...

640
00:52:22,014 --> 00:52:24,281
At least do that properly.

641
00:52:25,886 --> 00:52:30,508
Because if things go wrong, everything
you built could collapse out of nowhere.

642
00:52:35,712 --> 00:52:40,241
We'll begin with the DLP's
Congressman Oh Segwang.

643
00:52:42,246 --> 00:52:46,691
You've spent quite a few years
in the intelligence department,

644
00:52:46,795 --> 00:52:48,942
what were your duties?

645
00:52:49,059 --> 00:52:51,502
I was in the inspection division.

646
00:52:51,928 --> 00:52:57,961
My main duty was that of bringing
to light subversive acts of corruption.

647
00:52:58,055 --> 00:53:03,417
Do you believe to be righteous enough to
deserve judging other people's behavior?

648
00:53:04,533 --> 00:53:07,305
As you can see in the data
which was distributed to you,

649
00:53:07,493 --> 00:53:12,238
all my assets amount to
is a villa in Yonhee-Dong,

650
00:53:12,414 --> 00:53:15,970
and the ancestral graveyard site
I inherited from my late father.

651
00:53:16,106 --> 00:53:22,910
But of course I already pledged to
devote that land to a welfare institution.

652
00:53:24,167 --> 00:53:28,229
Your son is chairman of
Manbo Construction, right?

653
00:53:28,387 --> 00:53:32,316
My son was hired as a mere clerk,

654
00:53:32,431 --> 00:53:34,781
and reached that position all on his own.

655
00:53:34,893 --> 00:53:38,174
I always thought I could win one over him,

656
00:53:38,385 --> 00:53:44,059
so if you help me become prime
minister, I'll finally save face for a change.

657
00:53:44,153 --> 00:53:46,388
- Yes.
- President.

658
00:53:46,506 --> 00:53:49,011
We found Lee Seongmo.

659
00:53:51,910 --> 00:53:53,649
Where is he?

660
00:54:02,229 --> 00:54:05,576
That's the woman who's
looking after Lee Seongmo.

661
00:54:33,098 --> 00:54:36,904
Where did you hide that videotape?

662
00:54:37,239 --> 00:54:38,830
Uh?

663
00:54:39,533 --> 00:54:42,013
And the account?

664
00:54:47,005 --> 00:54:49,202
- Search everywhere!
- Yes.

665
00:55:11,203 --> 00:55:15,073
Next, Congressman Hwang Taeseop,
you may begin your inquiries.

666
00:55:16,189 --> 00:55:18,153
I'm Hwang Taeseop.

667
00:55:18,599 --> 00:55:26,446
The data and questionnaires
you gave us seem really flawless.

668
00:55:26,728 --> 00:55:28,423
Thank you.

669
00:55:28,619 --> 00:55:33,654
If I hadn't known a certain Jo Pilyeon firsthand,

670
00:55:34,241 --> 00:55:38,047
I'd be led to think that you're
the most honest and deserving...

671
00:55:38,235 --> 00:55:43,967
candidate for premier that
our country has ever seen.

672
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:51,197
But, unfortunately for you,
and most thankfully for this country,

673
00:55:51,409 --> 00:55:59,673
I can pride myself on knowing
Jo Pilyeon more than anyone else.

674
00:55:59,778 --> 00:56:03,994
Congressman Hwang,
I'd like you to refrain from...

675
00:56:04,286 --> 00:56:06,309
such invectives moved only by personal grudges.

676
00:56:06,403 --> 00:56:09,715
You just worry about
answering my questions.

677
00:56:12,934 --> 00:56:20,487
Remember what
happened on April 17, 1987?

678
00:56:20,652 --> 00:56:25,111
Well... I'm not the kind of man
who would write diaries, so...

679
00:56:25,579 --> 00:56:31,348
It is the day when Congressman Oh
Byeongtak died under mysterious circumstances!

680
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:43,098
Where were you on
that day, from 2 to 4 pm?

681
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:46,002
I don't remember.

682
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:48,539
You don't?!

683
00:56:48,811 --> 00:56:55,707
Then, I'm sure you don't remember
who you met eleven days after the fact,

684
00:56:55,811 --> 00:57:00,986
on April 28 at 9 pm?!

685
00:57:01,166 --> 00:57:02,898
Chairman.

686
00:57:03,009 --> 00:57:07,500
The prosecutors already found
me not guilty of any such allegation.

687
00:57:07,614 --> 00:57:11,914
I'd like you to caution him against
engaging in unnecessary mudslinging.

688
00:57:12,026 --> 00:57:12,976
Yes.

689
00:57:13,087 --> 00:57:17,535
Chairman Hwang, I must ask you to
present clear evidence supporting your claims.

690
00:57:17,676 --> 00:57:19,512
Fine.

691
00:57:20,906 --> 00:57:24,800
Candidate Jo seems
to suffer from bad memory, so...

692
00:57:24,971 --> 00:57:26,462
Chairman.

693
00:57:26,787 --> 00:57:28,498
I would like to call a witness.

694
00:57:28,592 --> 00:57:30,193
We will accept your request.

695
00:57:30,287 --> 00:57:32,765
The witness may enter.

696
00:58:02,928 --> 00:58:09,439
Witness, do you swear to tell the
truth before this court and your fellow citizens?

697
00:58:09,638 --> 00:58:10,930
I do.

698
00:58:11,369 --> 00:58:12,869
You may begin your inquiries.

699
00:58:13,632 --> 00:58:15,018
Witness.

700
00:58:15,406 --> 00:58:20,041
On April 28, 1987...

701
00:58:20,155 --> 00:58:21,864
At 9 pm.

702
00:58:21,982 --> 00:58:25,599
Where were you
and what were you doing?

703
00:58:25,905 --> 00:58:28,419
I was in an abandoned factory in Shiheung,

704
00:58:28,841 --> 00:58:31,014
meeting Jo Pilyeon.

705
00:58:32,659 --> 00:58:36,433
What happened there?

706
00:58:37,173 --> 00:58:39,663
He pointed a gun at me.

707
00:58:45,302 --> 00:58:47,663
And threatened to kill me,

708
00:58:48,286 --> 00:58:52,385
asking me to give him the account.

709
00:58:52,608 --> 00:58:56,880
By account,
what was he referring to?

710
00:58:56,974 --> 00:58:58,634
Chairman.

711
00:58:58,904 --> 00:59:05,193
The witness is engaging in despicable
perjury before the entire country!

712
00:59:05,252 --> 00:59:07,285
I ask the questions!

713
00:59:07,378 --> 00:59:08,823
Keep your mouth shut!

714
00:59:08,917 --> 00:59:10,190
Look, Congressman Hwang!

715
00:59:10,297 --> 00:59:12,429
Are we here to settle old scores?

716
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:14,208
Settle what?!

717
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:18,648
Please, be quiet.

718
00:59:22,090 --> 00:59:25,578
Witness, you may continue.

719
00:59:28,867 --> 00:59:30,844
There was an account.

720
00:59:31,804 --> 00:59:37,571
It listed all the large sums of money Jo
Pilyeon received from corporations...

721
00:59:37,771 --> 00:59:42,559
on behalf of a very high ranking official.

722
00:59:50,476 --> 00:59:51,933
Witness.

723
00:59:52,391 --> 00:59:57,637
Who would this "high ranking official" be?

724
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:10,530
The former president.

725
01:00:40,497 --> 01:00:42,764
Ajeosshi, I'm ba...

726
01:00:49,214 --> 01:00:51,117
Ajeosshi...

727
01:00:52,632 --> 01:00:54,594
Ajeosshi!

728
01:01:34,225 --> 01:01:35,385
What's this?

729
01:01:35,565 --> 01:01:36,853
It shows nothing.

730
01:01:36,971 --> 01:01:39,215
Seems like it wasn't recorded properly.

731
01:01:41,441 --> 01:01:43,496
So no account,

732
01:01:43,696 --> 01:01:45,681
and we did all this for nothing.

733
01:01:45,787 --> 01:01:47,872
How should I deal with him?

734
01:01:47,982 --> 01:01:49,158
What do you think?

735
01:01:49,287 --> 01:01:50,709
We'll just hand him to Jo Pilyeon.

736
01:01:50,826 --> 01:01:53,754
It might have been a
good showing on your part,

737
01:01:53,849 --> 01:01:56,392
but I'm afraid that won't cut it with me.

738
01:01:57,273 --> 01:02:03,510
So let's hear it, what's this clear
evidence you wanted to lure me here with?

739
01:02:03,651 --> 01:02:05,398
Were you so scared of it
that you abducted me?

740
01:02:05,468 --> 01:02:08,370
I wasn't scared, just curious.

741
01:02:08,757 --> 01:02:12,023
And I also came to
get something from you.

742
01:02:14,102 --> 01:02:16,087
Speak!

743
01:02:16,439 --> 01:02:20,427
What on earth is this
clear evidence you talked about?

744
01:02:20,721 --> 01:02:24,127
I guess only the audio is fine.

745
01:02:43,767 --> 01:02:46,832
The witness' testimony is a travesty!

746
01:02:46,926 --> 01:02:48,759
A secret presidential fund account?!

747
01:02:48,868 --> 01:02:50,580
Let's hear what else
he has to say, shall we?

748
01:02:50,662 --> 01:02:53,877
What else would you listen to?
This is a cabinet hearing!

749
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:55,302
Look here!

750
01:02:55,384 --> 01:02:57,786
Is the cabinet hearing
the real issue here?

751
01:02:57,845 --> 01:02:59,043
Chairman!

752
01:02:59,407 --> 01:03:03,080
We must sue the witness and
Congressman Hwang for contempt of congress!

753
01:03:03,190 --> 01:03:04,188
Sue?!

754
01:03:04,282 --> 01:03:06,761
We're just exposing the
truth, what damned lawsuit?!

755
01:03:06,866 --> 01:03:09,333
You're just a traitor, shut your mouth!

756
01:03:09,497 --> 01:03:10,773
Traitor?!

757
01:03:10,902 --> 01:03:12,324
How old are you, little prick?

758
01:03:12,418 --> 01:03:14,983
How dare you talk to me like that?

759
01:03:18,538 --> 01:03:22,567
Back when you
were in the KCIA, who...

760
01:03:22,719 --> 01:03:25,689
Like I needed your help...

761
01:03:25,897 --> 01:03:27,804
What did you say?

762
01:03:39,631 --> 01:03:42,631
The hearing will be briefly adjourned.

763
01:03:45,104 --> 01:03:47,623
Give it a rest, everyone!

764
01:03:53,904 --> 01:03:55,735
Jo Pilyeon...

765
01:03:59,048 --> 01:04:03,147
Don't you try to give
up that candidacy.

766
01:04:04,616 --> 01:04:05,755
What?!

767
01:04:06,237 --> 01:04:08,175
Because...

768
01:04:09,232 --> 01:04:14,988
it's judgment day for you.

776
01:04:41,429 --> 01:04:42,592
Miju is inside.

777
01:04:42,672 --> 01:04:44,236
Miju is still inside!

778
01:04:44,319 --> 01:04:46,198
I can't take this anymore.

779
01:04:46,292 --> 01:04:48,371
If I'll ever be born again,

780
01:04:48,453 --> 01:04:50,215
I want to be born as your brother.

781
01:04:50,286 --> 01:04:55,540
Congressman Oh Byeongtak
was killed by Jo Pilyeon!

782
01:04:55,654 --> 01:05:00,523
This is the account for that presidential fund.
