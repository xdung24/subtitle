Episode 44

4
00:00:09,751 --> 00:00:11,734
<i>Coffee for three.</i>

5
00:00:25,332 --> 00:00:26,730
Gangmo!

6
00:00:26,883 --> 00:00:28,731
You dare bite me?

7
00:00:35,027 --> 00:00:36,636
Listen.

8
00:00:37,067 --> 00:00:39,191
Are those people regulars?

9
00:00:39,281 --> 00:00:41,168
They come pretty often these days.

10
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,275
What kind of people are they?

11
00:00:44,904 --> 00:00:46,525
Gangsters.

12
00:00:46,883 --> 00:00:49,374
You can't imagine how annoying they are.

13
00:00:52,508 --> 00:00:55,116
Wait here just a moment.

14
00:01:05,753 --> 00:01:07,135
Ahh... I'm sorry.

15
00:01:07,288 --> 00:01:11,197
Hey... Did you leave your eyes at home?

16
00:01:12,374 --> 00:01:13,549
I apologize.

17
00:01:13,701 --> 00:01:14,688
I should have been more careful.

18
00:01:14,747 --> 00:01:16,462
- I ought to...
- Hey.

19
00:01:16,579 --> 00:01:18,462
Stop.

20
00:01:20,271 --> 00:01:25,405
Pay for the dry cleaner's,
and get the fuck out.

21
00:01:39,246 --> 00:01:42,277
Don't ever do anything you'll
have to feel sorry about again.

22
00:01:47,035 --> 00:01:49,902
Don't ever do anything you'll
have to feel sorry about again.

23
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:16,284
Where are all the others?

24
00:02:16,507 --> 00:02:18,295
I came here alone on their behalf.

25
00:02:18,586 --> 00:02:20,313
Have a seat.

26
00:02:26,002 --> 00:02:27,882
Care for a drink?

27
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,902
No, thanks.

28
00:02:30,595 --> 00:02:32,545
But forget that...

29
00:02:33,168 --> 00:02:37,984
There is only one week left before
the principal will have to be paid back.

30
00:02:38,092 --> 00:02:40,126
I'm sure you know already,

31
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:44,284
but if you retrieve all that money,
our organization will collapse.

32
00:02:44,448 --> 00:02:45,922
Is that what you wish for?

33
00:02:46,031 --> 00:02:48,689
It was Baekpa's last wish.

34
00:02:49,006 --> 00:02:53,879
And no matter what,
I will fulfill his wishes.

35
00:02:53,971 --> 00:02:56,633
Baekpa is no longer with us!

36
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:03,238
The living must go on.

37
00:03:04,614 --> 00:03:05,988
What are you trying to imply?

38
00:03:06,117 --> 00:03:09,794
Many people are voicing their
grievances within the organization.

39
00:03:10,258 --> 00:03:13,294
I'm just saying this for your own sake.

40
00:03:13,611 --> 00:03:17,481
I suggest you just put all this to rest.

41
00:03:19,276 --> 00:03:21,686
If you don't wire that money
by the end of the month,

42
00:03:21,839 --> 00:03:23,859
I will begin legal litigation.

43
00:03:24,446 --> 00:03:27,406
Convey it to the others as well.

44
00:03:27,724 --> 00:03:29,966
Bucheol...

45
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,627
He's rougher than I thought?!

46
00:03:46,181 --> 00:03:48,248
So it was you.

47
00:03:49,196 --> 00:03:51,796
The one behind Jeongyeon's abduction.

48
00:03:51,995 --> 00:03:56,981
You have nothing to gain
by reporting it to the police.

49
00:04:03,178 --> 00:04:04,769
Right.

50
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:10,965
Bucheol also wanted to tell you this.

51
00:04:11,587 --> 00:04:14,724
That he couldn't care less whether
Hwang Jeongyeon is your daughter or not.

52
00:04:14,876 --> 00:04:17,484
If you don't answer them in two days,

53
00:04:17,719 --> 00:04:22,707
Hwang Jeongyeon won't
get out of there alive.

54
00:04:25,484 --> 00:04:31,573
I'd prefer to see this matter 
conclude peacefully.

55
00:04:33,312 --> 00:04:37,365
A little compromise on your part,

56
00:04:38,929 --> 00:04:41,676
and I think we could settle it all?!

57
00:04:43,414 --> 00:04:45,435
If you'll excuse me.

58
00:05:08,577 --> 00:05:11,713
Look at how pretty she is.

59
00:05:16,338 --> 00:05:19,542
So, what, you're telling me
they're Bucheol's sidekicks?

60
00:05:19,683 --> 00:05:22,854
Anyhow, I told you Gangmo
has a quick eye for this.

61
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:27,365
First, we need to find out
where they're hiding,

62
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,450
so let's start by trailing them.

63
00:05:28,497 --> 00:05:29,707
Okay.

64
00:05:29,813 --> 00:05:32,738
Hey... Here they are.

65
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,962
They're going.

66
00:05:51,803 --> 00:05:53,936
We'll lose them, speed up!

67
00:05:54,018 --> 00:05:56,168
Stay put, will you?

68
00:05:56,262 --> 00:06:00,029
There are little to no cars,
so they'll find out right away.

69
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:07,811
Hey...

70
00:06:07,921 --> 00:06:13,477
Those fools behind seem to be following us?

71
00:06:15,018 --> 00:06:19,162
Find a quiet place and leave the road.

72
00:06:20,824 --> 00:06:24,472
What's this...
Why are they going that way?

73
00:06:24,594 --> 00:06:25,921
Did they find out?

74
00:06:25,992 --> 00:06:27,671
Follow them.

75
00:06:45,095 --> 00:06:46,036
Look.

76
00:06:46,107 --> 00:06:49,116
Why do you keep following us?

77
00:06:49,402 --> 00:06:50,632
Aigoo... Look at this one.

78
00:06:50,726 --> 00:06:51,900
It's the prick from earlier on?

79
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:56,826
I just thought I gave you a
little too much money, that's all.

80
00:06:56,892 --> 00:06:58,262
Say what?

81
00:06:58,361 --> 00:07:00,347
This prick must be retarded.

82
00:07:00,429 --> 00:07:02,367
Where is Cha Bucheol?

83
00:07:05,406 --> 00:07:06,866
Lee Gangmo?

84
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,687
I asked where Cha Bucheol is!

85
00:07:08,769 --> 00:07:10,355
You fuc...

86
00:07:39,269 --> 00:07:43,142
Shideok... Hit him!

87
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:05,964
Hyungnim!

88
00:08:06,105 --> 00:08:08,795
It's Lee Gangmo! Leave that place!

89
00:08:33,808 --> 00:08:35,985
<i>What's the matter, Hyungnim?</i>

90
00:08:36,772 --> 00:08:38,594
Take the boys and leave immediately.

91
00:08:38,815 --> 00:08:39,846
What?

92
00:08:40,542 --> 00:08:42,931
Lee Gangmo is here!

93
00:08:44,334 --> 00:08:47,731
Are you telling me Lee Gangmo
followed us all the way here?

94
00:08:53,687 --> 00:08:57,680
Then, why don't we wait here 
and just beat him to a...

95
00:08:58,067 --> 00:09:00,918
Think he'd be crazy enough 
to come alone?

96
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:05,131
- Hey... Go start the car.
- Yes, Hyungnim.

97
00:09:05,348 --> 00:09:06,954
Let's go.

98
00:09:13,674 --> 00:09:14,958
Hey.

99
00:09:15,436 --> 00:09:17,245
Hwang Jeongyeon!

100
00:09:20,534 --> 00:09:22,144
Open the door!

101
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,864
Hey!

102
00:09:25,508 --> 00:09:27,881
<i>You really have a death wish?</i>

103
00:09:28,081 --> 00:09:29,854
<i>Hwang Jeongyeon!</i>

104
00:09:29,984 --> 00:09:32,779
Hey... Speak while I still play nice.

105
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:34,682
Where is your hideout?

106
00:09:34,776 --> 00:09:36,703
We have no idea.

107
00:09:37,149 --> 00:09:38,004
Just kill us.

108
00:09:38,074 --> 00:09:40,199
You son of a...

109
00:09:40,307 --> 00:09:41,399
<i>Go ahead.</i>

110
00:09:41,492 --> 00:09:43,631
Kill us!

111
00:09:44,969 --> 00:09:49,386
Throw them in the car.

112
00:09:49,763 --> 00:09:51,555
Let's go.

113
00:09:51,776 --> 00:09:52,583
Get up.

114
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,970
Get moving.

115
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:02,101
You're dead. Got it?

116
00:10:05,121 --> 00:10:06,648
<i>The hell is this?</i>

117
00:10:06,896 --> 00:10:08,840
What are you doing?

118
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,322
What the hell are you trying to do?

119
00:10:12,427 --> 00:10:13,849
Guys.

120
00:10:14,612 --> 00:10:16,468
Stay away from the car.

121
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,268
G...G...Gangmo...

122
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:22,572
What's wrong with you?

123
00:10:22,665 --> 00:10:25,145
<i>Come with me.</i>

124
00:10:25,251 --> 00:10:27,734
- Gangmo!
- Sit.

125
00:10:28,163 --> 00:10:30,042
If you don't tell me 
by the count of three,

126
00:10:30,124 --> 00:10:32,091
you're all dead.

127
00:10:32,287 --> 00:10:35,051
- One...
- You crazy son of a bitch!

128
00:10:35,286 --> 00:10:36,343
Two!

129
00:10:36,423 --> 00:10:38,344
Don't kill us!

130
00:10:39,296 --> 00:10:41,006
Three!

131
00:10:41,215 --> 00:10:43,878
Spare us!

132
00:10:43,991 --> 00:10:46,448
Don't kill us!

133
00:10:50,313 --> 00:10:52,262
I try to treat you decently,

134
00:10:52,368 --> 00:10:54,694
and you look down on me?

135
00:10:55,199 --> 00:10:57,153
I ought to...

136
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,508
It's the police, right?

137
00:11:09,555 --> 00:11:11,529
I'd like to report an abduction.

138
00:11:11,599 --> 00:11:14,829
What? Yes. That'll be...

139
00:11:14,923 --> 00:11:16,180
Samgo Reservoir!

140
00:11:16,262 --> 00:11:18,106
Samgo Reservoir.

141
00:11:18,165 --> 00:11:19,904
<i>The villa by the reservoir.</i>

142
00:11:19,998 --> 00:11:20,759
Speed up.

143
00:11:20,818 --> 00:11:23,707
- I'm already pushing it to the limit.
- It's not a prank call!

144
00:11:31,648 --> 00:11:33,333
Here!

145
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,443
I think we lost them.

146
00:12:54,393 --> 00:12:56,296
<i>It's me, Lee Gangmo.</i>

147
00:12:59,277 --> 00:13:00,959
No need to beat around the bush.

148
00:13:01,076 --> 00:13:02,639
If you want this bitch to live,

149
00:13:02,709 --> 00:13:06,486
bring the pledge and
the IOU list to me alone.

150
00:13:06,762 --> 00:13:08,724
Let me hear Jeongyeon.

151
00:13:12,848 --> 00:13:14,162
Gangmo.

152
00:13:14,292 --> 00:13:15,901
Jeongyeon.

153
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:18,321
Are you okay?
Is everything all right?

154
00:13:18,438 --> 00:13:20,482
Yeah... I'm all right.

155
00:13:20,564 --> 00:13:22,032
<i>Listen well.</i>

156
00:13:22,115 --> 00:13:26,320
I'll come to get you, 
so don't be afraid and calm down.

157
00:13:26,426 --> 00:13:28,152
- Got it?
- Don't come, Gangmo.

158
00:13:28,281 --> 00:13:30,525
You must not come alone.

159
00:13:30,642 --> 00:13:33,191
Are we clear, Gangmo? You can't...

160
00:13:49,267 --> 00:13:51,276
You filed the report?

161
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:09,028
<i>Seems like you didn't live up 
to your end of the bargain?</i>

162
00:14:09,345 --> 00:14:12,191
What about Yoo Gyeongok's
pledge and IOU list?

163
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:14,732
<i>Give me just another few days.</i>

164
00:14:14,826 --> 00:14:16,138
What?

165
00:14:18,168 --> 00:14:19,415
<i>President...</i>

166
00:14:19,509 --> 00:14:23,879
The thing I hate most is people
who don't keep their promises.

167
00:14:24,055 --> 00:14:25,662
You know that.

168
00:14:25,803 --> 00:14:27,859
<i>I apologize, President.</i>

169
00:14:28,539 --> 00:14:30,878
For the last time, you have three days.

170
00:14:31,114 --> 00:14:33,074
If you fail again,

171
00:14:33,391 --> 00:14:36,704
you'll get to meet Baekpa six feet under.

172
00:14:44,811 --> 00:14:47,572
There... Right there.

173
00:14:52,867 --> 00:14:54,295
Turn around.

174
00:14:54,604 --> 00:14:55,449
What?

175
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,941
Where are we going, Hyungnim?

176
00:14:57,058 --> 00:14:58,351
Back to Seoul.

177
00:14:58,433 --> 00:15:00,747
Se...Seoul?!

178
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:03,601
Lee Gangmo got in the way,

179
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:07,176
so time for a little counterstrike.

180
00:15:08,997 --> 00:15:10,771
Take a good look.

181
00:15:10,888 --> 00:15:14,776
At how I beat your Lee Gangmo to a pulp.

182
00:15:23,785 --> 00:15:26,780
What have you two been doing all this time?

183
00:15:27,332 --> 00:15:29,937
Lee Gangmo is breathing down 
Cha Bucheol's neck.

184
00:15:30,052 --> 00:15:33,826
Everything we planned
might be ruined, you get that?

185
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:35,773
It's my fault.

186
00:15:35,984 --> 00:15:38,627
- I was so busy with other things that I...
- I know how busy you are!

187
00:15:38,745 --> 00:15:42,044
But how many times did I
tell you how important this is?

188
00:15:44,077 --> 00:15:45,663
We're back to square one.

189
00:15:45,776 --> 00:15:49,693
After what happened, 
Cha Bucheol will try to get his revenge.

190
00:15:49,798 --> 00:15:51,076
What are you trying to say?

191
00:15:51,194 --> 00:15:55,055
He'll try to use Hwang Jeongyeon
as bait for the pledge and IOU list,

192
00:15:55,164 --> 00:15:57,184
so that Lee Gangmo will
be forced to bring that.

193
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,986
Then, it would be much
quicker to find Lee Gangmo.

194
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:02,195
I'm sure of it.

195
00:16:02,359 --> 00:16:05,261
I will tolerate no mistakes
this time, is that clear?

196
00:16:05,413 --> 00:16:06,835
All right.

197
00:16:10,045 --> 00:16:13,789
What is keeping Seongmo so busy?

198
00:16:13,913 --> 00:16:17,626
- As you know, the situation is very ser...
- Tell me something I don't know!

199
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,882
I'm asking you what he's doing these days.

200
00:16:20,058 --> 00:16:21,573
Ahh... Yes. That...

201
00:16:22,571 --> 00:16:24,313
I don't really know.

202
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:30,028
Yes.

203
00:16:31,255 --> 00:16:32,420
Yes, Sir!

204
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:33,769
Yes, Sir!

205
00:16:33,913 --> 00:16:34,615
Certainly, Sir.

206
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,729
I will be there right away.

207
00:17:02,228 --> 00:17:08,347
I never imagined there could be support
for direct elections within the ruling party.

208
00:17:08,417 --> 00:17:11,283
I guess they've heard
the voice of the people.

209
00:17:12,293 --> 00:17:14,396
And what are you trying to imply?

210
00:17:14,502 --> 00:17:16,345
It's for the president's sake.

211
00:17:16,457 --> 00:17:20,971
Isn't letting him hear what the 
people are saying part of our duties?

212
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:24,331
Anyhow, with this secret mandate,

213
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:28,253
we must eradicate these
traitors at the very root.

214
00:17:28,652 --> 00:17:31,351
I'll handle all third-termers and below,

215
00:17:31,504 --> 00:17:35,063
so you take care of all the veterans.

216
00:17:51,228 --> 00:17:53,845
It's a list of ruling party
members who are sympathizing...

217
00:17:53,941 --> 00:17:57,122
with the prospect of
a constitutional amendment.

218
00:17:58,446 --> 00:18:03,987
If I think of what I had to
go through to compile that list...

219
00:18:04,095 --> 00:18:08,829
To make that amendment happen,
these numbers won't do.

220
00:18:09,553 --> 00:18:13,753
This all depends on Congressman Oh.

221
00:18:14,392 --> 00:18:17,881
But once he sees that secret account,

222
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:21,205
he'll surely join forces with us.

223
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:23,681
I wouldn't jump to conclusions yet.

224
00:18:23,861 --> 00:18:26,970
Until you find out his true intentions,

225
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,918
you can't show him our cards.

226
00:18:30,024 --> 00:18:31,656
Right.

227
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:36,355
I only have one life, so better be careful.

228
00:18:36,498 --> 00:18:38,617
We'll be late for tonight's meeting.

229
00:18:39,937 --> 00:18:43,191
I'll have to get going, then.

230
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:57,475
May I ask you one thing?

231
00:18:58,414 --> 00:19:02,764
Why did you join forces with Hwang Taeseop?

232
00:19:02,905 --> 00:19:05,825
I didn't join forces with anyone, 
I'm just using him.

233
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,989
If things go according to plan,

234
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:12,936
our country's political circles
will be turned upside down.

235
00:19:13,112 --> 00:19:17,151
And of course Jo Pilyeon will be
the first to suffer the consequences.

236
00:19:17,259 --> 00:19:19,166
But it could also fail.

237
00:19:20,282 --> 00:19:25,332
Then, I guess we'll be in 
for a huge crimson tide.

238
00:19:25,481 --> 00:19:29,458
And Hwang Taeseop will bear the brunt of it.

239
00:19:31,889 --> 00:19:37,528
So if we succeed, Jo Pilyeon. And if 
we fail, it'll be Hwang Taeseop's turn.

240
00:19:37,633 --> 00:19:40,159
But we can't fail.

241
00:19:41,075 --> 00:19:43,320
Because if that happens,

242
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:49,382
then we'd only have helped Jo Pilyeon
build an inexpugnable fortress around him.

243
00:19:50,502 --> 00:19:52,305
Before that happens,

244
00:19:53,938 --> 00:19:56,495
he must be destroyed.

245
00:20:02,814 --> 00:20:05,387
Most of the people who
claimed to know Lee Miju...

246
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:08,567
just made false reports
with the cash reward in mind.

247
00:20:09,961 --> 00:20:12,687
And considering that we got
reports from all over the country,

248
00:20:12,781 --> 00:20:15,412
verifying every single one
would be a little bit of a challenge.

249
00:20:15,529 --> 00:20:16,716
Stop it.

250
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:20,276
Some suggest she does resemble
a certain singer named Cha Soojeong.

251
00:20:20,388 --> 00:20:22,335
I said stop!

252
00:20:23,429 --> 00:20:24,772
I apologize, Chairman.

253
00:20:24,913 --> 00:20:26,640
You may leave.

254
00:20:27,908 --> 00:20:31,439
Your mother will be discharged this evening,

255
00:20:31,528 --> 00:20:34,979
so she asked if you could take her home.

256
00:21:09,464 --> 00:21:11,932
She practically spends all
her time practicing these days.

257
00:21:12,014 --> 00:21:16,950
If she keeps this up, her live debut 
will be a huge success, Director.

258
00:21:21,664 --> 00:21:23,854
I am quite busy these days.

259
00:21:23,957 --> 00:21:26,390
I won't be able to 
visit often until her debut.

260
00:21:27,225 --> 00:21:29,623
So keep an eye on her training schedule.

261
00:21:29,727 --> 00:21:32,007
All right, Director.

262
00:21:45,766 --> 00:21:51,273
I knew your father ran this hospital
and your uncle was an army general,

263
00:21:51,557 --> 00:21:54,172
but you're telling me
your other uncle is a diplomat?

264
00:21:54,348 --> 00:21:55,854
Yes...

265
00:21:58,167 --> 00:21:59,681
You're here?

266
00:22:00,421 --> 00:22:01,572
Yes.

267
00:22:01,834 --> 00:22:03,498
Are you going to be discharged now?

268
00:22:03,933 --> 00:22:05,792
What's with all the rush?

269
00:22:05,931 --> 00:22:10,612
Why don't you two have dinner together?

270
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:15,675
You're not going to
stand me up again, are you?

271
00:22:16,015 --> 00:22:18,554
What are you doing?

272
00:22:21,687 --> 00:22:23,018
How much is it?

273
00:22:23,089 --> 00:22:25,074
30,000 won.

274
00:22:29,804 --> 00:22:31,029
Let's go.

275
00:22:31,123 --> 00:22:33,408
Wooju was here just a moment ago.

276
00:22:33,479 --> 00:22:35,821
Where did he go again?

277
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:39,066
Aww... I can't take my eyes off him 
for a single second.

278
00:22:39,161 --> 00:22:41,561
Wait here just a moment.

279
00:22:45,307 --> 00:22:48,397
Wait a moment.

280
00:22:48,456 --> 00:22:51,263
I'll go get changed and will be right back.

281
00:23:01,342 --> 00:23:02,702
Give it back.

282
00:23:02,785 --> 00:23:05,745
It's mine, give it here.

283
00:23:23,372 --> 00:23:26,684
That toy is mine.

284
00:23:26,802 --> 00:23:27,777
And?

285
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:29,738
He won't give it back.

286
00:23:30,255 --> 00:23:31,720
So?

287
00:23:37,902 --> 00:23:39,299
All right.

288
00:23:39,487 --> 00:23:41,965
So I can just get it back for you, right?

289
00:23:43,762 --> 00:23:45,371
Let's go.

290
00:23:54,855 --> 00:23:56,331
Kiddo.

291
00:23:56,712 --> 00:23:58,281
That's not yours, is it?

292
00:23:58,469 --> 00:24:00,020
<i>It's his.</i>

293
00:24:00,171 --> 00:24:01,887
<i>Give it here.</i>

294
00:24:10,053 --> 00:24:11,462
Here.

295
00:24:12,205 --> 00:24:13,389
Happy now?

296
00:24:13,541 --> 00:24:15,947
Thank you.

297
00:24:17,218 --> 00:24:19,545
But you never seem to cry?!

298
00:24:19,674 --> 00:24:25,228
Mommy said men shouldn't cry.

299
00:24:25,567 --> 00:24:27,931
You can cry, since you're still a kid.

300
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:30,248
I'm not a kid.

301
00:24:30,328 --> 00:24:31,652
Then?

302
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:33,169
What are you?

303
00:24:39,877 --> 00:24:41,994
Mommy...

304
00:25:04,788 --> 00:25:07,054
Mommy, why are you crying?

305
00:25:07,143 --> 00:25:09,919
I'm not crying, Wooju.

306
00:25:19,233 --> 00:25:20,925
I've made you wait, didn't I?

307
00:25:21,031 --> 00:25:22,522
Let's go.

308
00:25:25,347 --> 00:25:28,426
I will pay back the courtesy today,
considering all you did for my mother.

309
00:25:28,567 --> 00:25:33,184
But I'd like you to stop trying
to use my mother for this.

310
00:25:33,372 --> 00:25:35,603
It's quite offensive, actually.

311
00:26:39,004 --> 00:26:41,602
Why? Surprised?

312
00:26:42,154 --> 00:26:43,919
Thanks.

313
00:26:44,459 --> 00:26:46,914
I was starting to miss
that ugly mug of yours.

314
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:50,450
Give me a break... Still acting cocky?

315
00:26:51,371 --> 00:26:52,882
I'll keep it short and sweet.

316
00:26:53,093 --> 00:26:56,992
You have until tomorrow at midnight
to bring me both pledge and IOU list.

317
00:26:57,634 --> 00:26:58,766
Where should I go?

318
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:00,657
Don't take it so lightly.

319
00:27:00,728 --> 00:27:03,277
Hwang Jeongyeon is going to die.

320
00:27:04,917 --> 00:27:06,660
My boys will show you the way tomorrow.

321
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:12,912
Should the police be tagging along,
or if you try anything funny,

322
00:27:13,018 --> 00:27:17,575
neither you nor Yoo Gyeongok
will ever see Hwang Jeongyeon again.

323
00:27:17,822 --> 00:27:19,608
Are we clear?

324
00:27:52,968 --> 00:27:57,831
Looks like we'll have to give them
that pledge and the IOU list first.

325
00:28:00,016 --> 00:28:01,085
That's out of the question.

326
00:28:01,214 --> 00:28:04,002
There is no other way if
we want to save Jeongyeon.

327
00:28:04,202 --> 00:28:05,811
So, what,

328
00:28:06,364 --> 00:28:09,828
will you just take that 
to them all by yourself?

329
00:28:09,926 --> 00:28:13,117
We're forced to follow 
their conditions for now.

330
00:28:13,246 --> 00:28:16,019
Don't you get what they're scheming?

331
00:28:17,146 --> 00:28:20,529
Both Jeongyeon and you are in danger.

332
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:23,712
And you'll even lose
the pledge and IOU list.

333
00:28:23,853 --> 00:28:27,448
It won't go as they wish.

334
00:28:28,899 --> 00:28:30,544
What are you trying to say?

335
00:28:30,685 --> 00:28:35,360
Do you have any plan in mind?

336
00:28:35,583 --> 00:28:39,612
Leave this to me to the end.

337
00:28:40,439 --> 00:28:45,413
At this point, I am the 
only one who can solve this.

338
00:28:49,301 --> 00:28:53,318
Let's put our faith in him.

339
00:28:54,195 --> 00:28:58,033
If it's Gangmo, I believe he can do it.

340
00:29:13,937 --> 00:29:16,087
I'd like to meet my brother tomorrow.

341
00:29:16,545 --> 00:29:18,471
1 pm, at the usual Japanese restaurant.

342
00:29:18,589 --> 00:29:20,954
Yes, I will tell him.

343
00:29:21,062 --> 00:29:23,081
Anything else you'd like to convey?

344
00:29:23,234 --> 00:29:26,476
There are people following me.

345
00:29:39,807 --> 00:29:43,754
Yes. He just met Yoo Gyeongok.

346
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:47,527
He's probably just going back home.

347
00:29:47,635 --> 00:29:50,042
Don't take your eyes off him for a moment.

348
00:29:50,242 --> 00:29:53,684
- Got it?
- Yes, all right.

349
00:30:06,931 --> 00:30:11,921
But can we really leave Lee Gangmo's 
surveillance to Chanseong?

350
00:30:12,873 --> 00:30:15,884
That's his specialty,
so you don't need to worry.

351
00:30:19,159 --> 00:30:20,785
Chanseong.

352
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,748
I'm back, Chief.

353
00:30:23,512 --> 00:30:24,428
Lee Gangmo?

354
00:30:24,545 --> 00:30:27,028
He just went back home.

355
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:31,234
Other agents are checking on him, 
so there's no need to worry.

356
00:30:31,761 --> 00:30:36,730
I need some shut-eye,
so wake me up a little later.

357
00:30:45,891 --> 00:30:47,911
<i>This is the IOU list,</i>

358
00:30:49,838 --> 00:30:52,668
and here are the rest of the documents.

359
00:30:54,343 --> 00:30:58,668
Are you really going to sign
a pledge renouncing the principal?

360
00:32:01,633 --> 00:32:06,954
Now everything depends on you.

361
00:32:58,005 --> 00:33:00,437
Will you have company, Sir?

362
00:33:01,797 --> 00:33:03,256
Yes.

363
00:33:09,456 --> 00:33:11,671
<i>I've heard from Chanseong.</i>

364
00:33:14,819 --> 00:33:17,133
So you must meet Cha Bucheol alone?

365
00:33:17,227 --> 00:33:21,147
They will tag along
from the very beginning.

366
00:33:21,358 --> 00:33:22,968
So it won't be easy to trail you.

367
00:33:23,085 --> 00:33:27,361
The slightest suspicion,
and Jeongyeon will be in danger.

368
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:29,605
Did you prepare all the documents?

369
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:31,970
I have them.

370
00:33:34,994 --> 00:33:37,537
You were after 
Cha Bucheol as well, right?

371
00:33:37,725 --> 00:33:39,252
Told you, didn't I?

372
00:33:39,522 --> 00:33:41,625
That I was dealing 
with this troublesome fella.

373
00:33:41,766 --> 00:33:46,439
It doesn't matter anyway, does it?
You'll be following me, after all.

374
00:33:48,107 --> 00:33:50,198
Open the chopstick holder.

375
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:55,543
<i>It's a tracking device.</i>

376
00:33:56,612 --> 00:33:58,492
<i>It does have limited range,</i>

377
00:33:58,739 --> 00:34:02,098
<i>but we'll be able to follow you 
without arousing suspicion.</i>

378
00:34:02,333 --> 00:34:09,111
The key is that nothing
must happen until I get there.

379
00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:12,917
I'll try to hang in there, 
whatever the case.

380
00:34:31,645 --> 00:34:34,523
Who did you come to meet?

381
00:34:38,705 --> 00:34:43,215
I thought you might
have something to tell me.

382
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:49,041
The IOU list and the
pledge are ready, I hope?

383
00:34:49,217 --> 00:34:50,940
Of course.

384
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:55,227
Come to the riverbank 
in Mapo tonight at nine.

385
00:34:55,403 --> 00:34:57,248
By yourself.

386
00:35:21,363 --> 00:35:22,596
<i>Hey... Gangmo.</i>

387
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:25,572
Just report them to the police 
and get it over with!

388
00:35:25,756 --> 00:35:27,788
If you go there by yourself, 
they'll kill you!

389
00:35:27,858 --> 00:35:30,508
Unless you were completely crazy, 
why would you go there?

390
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:32,798
Or if you don't want the police
to get involved, go there with us.

391
00:35:32,904 --> 00:35:34,924
We need to live and die together!

392
00:35:35,054 --> 00:35:38,613
That's right, let's go together.
I still have a lot left in the tank.

393
00:35:38,683 --> 00:35:41,919
Look at these biceps.
I can handle them!

394
00:35:43,716 --> 00:35:44,949
Aren't you going home?

395
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:47,404
Should we be worrying about that now?

396
00:35:48,262 --> 00:35:50,670
Did you just get angry at me?

397
00:35:50,822 --> 00:35:52,420
I'll have to go.

398
00:35:52,907 --> 00:35:54,487
- Gangmo...
- Hey, Gangmo.

399
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:57,628
How could you get angry at me?

400
00:35:57,687 --> 00:35:59,355
Let me go, will you?

401
00:35:59,484 --> 00:36:01,211
My God...

402
00:36:02,953 --> 00:36:04,112
- Hey...
- Gangmo.

403
00:36:04,206 --> 00:36:05,310
Gangmo.

404
00:36:05,416 --> 00:36:07,201
Wake up, please.

405
00:36:07,291 --> 00:36:08,774
Don't worry.

406
00:36:08,882 --> 00:36:10,277
I have a plan.

407
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:11,259
A plan?

408
00:36:11,353 --> 00:36:15,777
Did he, what, report this
to someone without telling us?

409
00:36:16,451 --> 00:36:18,636
I'll see you again soon.

410
00:36:19,745 --> 00:36:21,064
- Gangmo.
- Gangmo!

411
00:36:21,175 --> 00:36:22,800
Gangmo!

412
00:36:22,988 --> 00:36:26,385
Gangmo is not the type to
just barge in without a plan.

413
00:36:26,442 --> 00:36:28,803
I'm sure he thought of something.

414
00:36:28,911 --> 00:36:31,493
I really don't know what to do anymore.

415
00:36:31,622 --> 00:36:32,843
Hey, Gangmo!

416
00:36:32,914 --> 00:36:35,495
Ahh... That damned stubbornness.

417
00:36:36,151 --> 00:36:38,790
Gyeongja, what's the matter?

418
00:36:39,023 --> 00:36:42,758
Sotae... How could you do this to me?

419
00:36:42,993 --> 00:36:45,166
Gyeongja, is anything wrong?

420
00:36:45,425 --> 00:36:46,952
Gyeongja!

421
00:36:47,116 --> 00:36:48,834
What's wrong with her?

422
00:36:49,473 --> 00:36:50,941
All right.

423
00:36:51,833 --> 00:36:53,572
Careful, Gangmo.

424
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,179
Looks like Lee Gangmo
might soon make his move.

425
00:37:01,308 --> 00:37:02,224
Get ready.

426
00:37:02,307 --> 00:37:03,622
All right.

427
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:05,830
Where is he now?

428
00:37:05,983 --> 00:37:08,051
I managed to plant
a tracking device on his car.

429
00:37:08,156 --> 00:37:09,953
Let's get ready.

430
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,738
Don't you have one for me?

431
00:37:19,844 --> 00:37:24,146
You know that civilians 
can't carry firearms.

432
00:37:24,893 --> 00:37:28,610
We have a baton.
Do you want this?

433
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,955
- You weren't followed, right?
- Of course not, Hyungnim.

434
00:37:57,049 --> 00:37:58,400
Nobody followed us.

435
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:03,039
Just in case, stay behind
and watch our backs.

436
00:38:03,439 --> 00:38:05,518
All right, Hyungnim.

437
00:38:15,896 --> 00:38:17,447
The documents?

438
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:44,662
We're leaving right now, Hyungnim.

439
00:38:44,826 --> 00:38:45,860
Yes.

440
00:38:46,942 --> 00:38:48,833
It was just Lee Gangmo.

441
00:38:48,986 --> 00:38:50,207
<i>You verified the pledge?</i>

442
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:51,852
Of course, Hyungnim.

443
00:38:52,244 --> 00:38:53,250
Yes.

444
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:55,176
All right, Hyungnim.

445
00:38:57,702 --> 00:38:59,029
Let's go.

446
00:39:36,549 --> 00:39:39,525
When is Lee Gangmo coming?

447
00:39:50,965 --> 00:39:53,032
That's the car.

448
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:57,267
Seems like that's all, shall we start?

449
00:39:57,408 --> 00:39:58,747
<i>Wait.</i>

450
00:39:58,994 --> 00:40:01,625
You said it had a
five-kilometer range, right?

451
00:40:02,025 --> 00:40:04,687
We can't allow them to spot us,

452
00:40:04,862 --> 00:40:07,135
so let's keep our distance
and start a little later.

453
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:38,138
I've given it a thought,

454
00:40:38,373 --> 00:40:40,417
and it does surprise me a little.

455
00:40:41,004 --> 00:40:43,001
<i>That Lee Gangmo.</i>

456
00:40:43,248 --> 00:40:48,785
Unless he's really got a screw or 
two loose, how could he come here alone?

457
00:40:49,442 --> 00:40:51,897
<i>So it's one of the two.</i>

458
00:40:52,403 --> 00:40:55,680
Either he's completely
gone crazy for you,

459
00:40:56,267 --> 00:40:59,464
or maybe he thinks
I'm just a half-witted thug.

460
00:41:04,645 --> 00:41:10,395
Once you get what you want, let us go.

461
00:41:12,285 --> 00:41:17,171
Don't hurt Gangmo.

462
00:41:19,051 --> 00:41:22,856
Do you even realize what I had
to go through because of that prick?

463
00:41:23,091 --> 00:41:27,289
And you think I'd just let 
someone like him get away with it?

464
00:41:27,477 --> 00:41:29,732
You rat bastard.

465
00:41:31,506 --> 00:41:36,040
I've heard that so much over the years,
it almost sounds like a compliment.

466
00:41:40,769 --> 00:41:42,661
So take a good look.

467
00:41:43,072 --> 00:41:46,995
See what happens to your Lee Gangmo.

468
00:42:09,711 --> 00:42:13,512
You'll see a warehouse around the corner.

469
00:42:13,665 --> 00:42:15,803
We're almost there.

470
00:42:28,005 --> 00:42:30,598
- What's wrong with it?
- We're out of range.

471
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:32,149
Go faster.

472
00:42:40,806 --> 00:42:42,708
Gangmo!

473
00:43:05,151 --> 00:43:07,394
Let's see the documents first.

474
00:43:09,542 --> 00:43:11,809
First set Jeongyeon free.

475
00:43:13,395 --> 00:43:17,929
You're not thinking you'll
get out of here alive, are you?

476
00:43:21,614 --> 00:43:23,810
Don't! Stop, Gangmo!

477
00:43:23,892 --> 00:43:25,933
<i>Gangmo!</i>

478
00:43:37,022 --> 00:43:38,995
Stop there!

479
00:43:43,753 --> 00:43:47,124
Set her free right now.

480
00:43:47,511 --> 00:43:52,110
If you don't, you'll need 
an ashtray for these.

481
00:43:56,139 --> 00:44:00,192
If you want to see this
bitch dead, go ahead and try!

482
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:02,253
Gangmo...

483
00:44:02,335 --> 00:44:04,343
<i>She's important to you, isn't she?</i>

484
00:44:04,508 --> 00:44:07,668
Isn't that the reason you
risked your life and came here?

485
00:44:07,762 --> 00:44:09,606
Take your hands off her.

486
00:44:11,113 --> 00:44:13,259
Give me those documents 
while you still can.

487
00:44:13,435 --> 00:44:15,293
- Do it!
- Don't, Gangmo!

488
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,049
Don't do it.

489
00:44:17,261 --> 00:44:21,625
With those in your hands,
you can get out of here alive.

490
00:44:21,795 --> 00:44:24,097
You can never give them
those documents, Gangmo.

491
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:25,882
You can't...

492
00:44:30,149 --> 00:44:32,956
Give me those damned documents!

493
00:44:46,816 --> 00:44:48,872
Stop!

494
00:45:06,973 --> 00:45:08,454
Gangmo...

495
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:10,698
You fool.

496
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,831
Why did you come here?

497
00:45:17,933 --> 00:45:19,836
<i>Gangmo...</i>

498
00:45:21,275 --> 00:45:23,043
No!

499
00:45:23,131 --> 00:45:27,689
No... Gangmo!

500
00:45:27,842 --> 00:45:29,580
<i>Gangmo!</i>

501
00:45:29,968 --> 00:45:31,647
Stop.

502
00:45:41,939 --> 00:45:44,030
Gangmo...

503
00:45:48,772 --> 00:45:52,073
I was an amateur boxer back in school.

504
00:45:52,191 --> 00:45:55,468
I saw at the health club 
that you box a little?!

505
00:45:59,814 --> 00:46:01,269
How about it?

506
00:46:01,422 --> 00:46:05,451
If you beat me, I could let you go.

507
00:46:07,389 --> 00:46:10,149
Gangmo...

508
00:46:18,268 --> 00:46:19,541
What the hell is going on?

509
00:46:19,694 --> 00:46:22,313
What if we lose him?

510
00:46:29,296 --> 00:46:30,682
They might have stopped around here.

511
00:46:30,752 --> 00:46:32,831
Slow down a little.

512
00:47:20,573 --> 00:47:22,776
I guess because you only saw me 
groveling at people's feet,

513
00:47:22,870 --> 00:47:24,644
you thought I was 
just a pushover, right?

514
00:47:24,808 --> 00:47:26,382
<i>Didn't you?</i>

515
00:47:26,641 --> 00:47:29,096
<i>So that's why you
came here afraid of nothing.</i>

516
00:47:29,225 --> 00:47:32,498
Since you must have thought
I was nothing but a retard!

517
00:47:33,144 --> 00:47:34,495
<i>Get up.</i>

518
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:37,444
<i>Get up!</i>

519
00:47:37,632 --> 00:47:39,934
I told you that 
if you beat me I'll spare her.

520
00:47:40,075 --> 00:47:41,520
Uh?

521
00:47:42,589 --> 00:47:45,536
Don't get up, Gangmo!

522
00:47:48,065 --> 00:47:52,153
Don't get up, you idiot!

523
00:48:25,175 --> 00:48:27,019
Die... Die!

524
00:48:27,111 --> 00:48:29,368
Die!

525
00:48:42,792 --> 00:48:45,012
Gangmo!

526
00:49:00,382 --> 00:49:01,900
Freeze!

527
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:38,009
Gangmo...

528
00:49:40,096 --> 00:49:41,376
Gangmo.

529
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:43,803
Gangmo...

530
00:49:44,517 --> 00:49:45,856
<i>Gangmo...</i>

531
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:47,312
<i>Gangmo.</i>

532
00:49:47,395 --> 00:49:50,660
Gangmo!

533
00:49:52,066 --> 00:49:54,967
Gangmo...

534
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:02,836
Gangmo...

535
00:50:05,643 --> 00:50:07,757
<i>Freeze!</i>

536
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:14,935
Hey!

537
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:33,682
Gangmo.

538
00:50:36,726 --> 00:50:38,474
Gangmo...

539
00:50:40,835 --> 00:50:42,668
Wake up.

540
00:50:42,773 --> 00:50:45,071
Gangmo!

541
00:50:48,707 --> 00:50:50,742
Gangmo...

542
00:51:02,653 --> 00:51:04,099
Are you all right?

543
00:51:04,193 --> 00:51:06,448
You idiot.

544
00:51:07,905 --> 00:51:10,333
Am I the problem now?

545
00:51:12,782 --> 00:51:15,772
If you are okay, then that's it.

546
00:51:36,172 --> 00:51:37,416
Hey... Cha Bucheol!!

547
00:51:37,510 --> 00:51:39,109
Come here.

548
00:51:39,248 --> 00:51:41,336
You piece of shit!

549
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:58,184
It's Go Jaechun!

550
00:51:58,489 --> 00:52:01,040
It's not Cha Bucheol, it's Go Jaechun.

551
00:52:02,013 --> 00:52:04,431
Are you telling me Go Jaechun 
took the documents?

552
00:52:04,632 --> 00:52:06,112
I think so.

553
00:52:13,194 --> 00:52:14,627
Gangmo.

554
00:52:14,827 --> 00:52:16,784
Are you all right, Gangmo?

555
00:52:18,221 --> 00:52:20,247
He's my brother.

556
00:52:22,914 --> 00:52:24,676
Gangmo.

557
00:52:25,568 --> 00:52:27,718
Thanks for coming, Hyung.

558
00:52:31,603 --> 00:52:34,251
How about the documents?

559
00:52:34,404 --> 00:52:36,706
Go Jaechun took them.

560
00:52:39,384 --> 00:52:41,299
First, let's go to the hospital.

561
00:52:41,513 --> 00:52:43,527
Can you drive?

562
00:52:44,373 --> 00:52:46,204
Don't worry about Gangmo.

563
00:52:46,346 --> 00:52:48,425
I'll take him there.

564
00:53:00,976 --> 00:53:03,831
Good job, Jaechun.
You were brilliant!

565
00:53:03,983 --> 00:53:06,485
It wouldn't have happened
unless Seongmo held them back.

566
00:53:06,614 --> 00:53:09,576
You never betray my expectations.

567
00:53:09,693 --> 00:53:11,949
I'm proud of you both.

568
00:53:13,816 --> 00:53:16,577
How about Lee Gangmo?

569
00:53:16,766 --> 00:53:19,312
Yes, he's been hospitalized.

570
00:53:19,772 --> 00:53:24,679
I wish we could have just gotten
ourselves rid of him once and for all.

571
00:53:27,463 --> 00:53:29,961
I wasn't implying I wanted you 
to get your hands dirty.

572
00:53:30,086 --> 00:53:35,791
If that Cha Bucheol had taken care of him,
we would have killed two birds with a stone.

573
00:53:38,223 --> 00:53:40,634
Let's go out for drinks.

574
00:53:40,743 --> 00:53:43,487
I'll treat you all the way.

575
00:53:44,354 --> 00:53:46,233
I need to go somewhere urgently.

576
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:47,751
Really?

577
00:53:47,865 --> 00:53:50,392
Then, we'll have to
save it for another time.

578
00:53:51,919 --> 00:53:53,211
Right.

579
00:53:59,366 --> 00:54:01,751
With this in my hands,

580
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:07,042
it's only a matter of time before the
private lending cartel is under my control.

581
00:54:17,251 --> 00:54:20,319
Now that those documents
are in his hands, what's next?

582
00:54:23,654 --> 00:54:25,616
I need to go to the broadcasting station.

583
00:54:26,074 --> 00:54:30,114
Right... Miju's live debut was today.

584
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:33,439
Gangmo?

585
00:54:33,963 --> 00:54:35,764
He is still likely at the hospital,

586
00:54:35,917 --> 00:54:37,573
would he be able to make it?

587
00:55:18,025 --> 00:55:20,477
Everyone get ready.

588
00:55:24,247 --> 00:55:28,699
Soojeong, I'll go deal with your costumes,
so say hi and get your makeup done.

589
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:30,578
Yes.

590
00:55:34,322 --> 00:55:36,827
I'm new singer Cha Soojeong.

591
00:55:37,038 --> 00:55:39,763
I'll be counting on you, Seonbaenim.

592
00:55:45,578 --> 00:55:47,525
So you're Cha Soojeong?

593
00:55:47,690 --> 00:55:48,970
Yes...

594
00:55:49,158 --> 00:55:51,366
Hong Jiyoung Seonbaenim, right?

595
00:55:51,844 --> 00:55:53,128
Seonbaenim?

596
00:55:53,998 --> 00:55:56,359
Who ever said I'd consider you a peer?

597
00:55:56,476 --> 00:55:57,181
What?

598
00:55:57,286 --> 00:56:01,959
I hear you're selling
your albums on the street?

599
00:56:02,184 --> 00:56:06,200
<i>How dare they let some corny
tramp embarrass our profession?</i>

600
00:56:08,114 --> 00:56:10,863
What connections did you have, 
to get on this show?

601
00:56:11,157 --> 00:56:16,547
By any chance, did you sell 
something else other than those albums?

602
00:56:21,692 --> 00:56:23,748
Look, Hong Jiyoung.

603
00:56:24,218 --> 00:56:25,604
What?

604
00:56:30,191 --> 00:56:31,835
"Hong Jiyoung"?

605
00:56:32,158 --> 00:56:34,302
You said you don't consider me a peer.

606
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:37,320
So you can forget that
"Seonbaenim" from me as well.

607
00:56:40,017 --> 00:56:42,201
Look at this little tramp...

608
00:56:45,326 --> 00:56:46,982
Consider this a warning.

609
00:56:47,088 --> 00:56:48,568
I can fight quite well.

610
00:56:48,685 --> 00:56:51,845
So if you keep acting
like that, I could just...

611
00:57:05,396 --> 00:57:07,298
I apologize for all that.

612
00:57:07,381 --> 00:57:10,458
I'll be counting on you, Seonbaenim.

613
00:57:15,944 --> 00:57:18,034
<i>- Costume Room -</i>

614
00:57:25,538 --> 00:57:27,626
<i>- Cha Soojeong -</i>

615
00:57:29,888 --> 00:57:35,099
Let's see how you deal with
an embarrassment on live TV.

616
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:42,488
What do we do now?

617
00:57:42,581 --> 00:57:44,132
Don't you have any other costume?

618
00:57:44,226 --> 00:57:46,451
This is all we have...

619
00:57:46,545 --> 00:57:48,718
I'll be damned, really!

620
00:57:52,066 --> 00:57:53,593
What's the matter?

621
00:57:53,807 --> 00:57:57,281
Someone ruined my stage costume.

622
00:57:59,922 --> 00:58:02,743
What happened to that costume, 
all of a sudden?

623
00:58:16,613 --> 00:58:17,816
Everyone, get ready.

624
00:58:17,887 --> 00:58:20,048
<i>We're starting soon.</i>

625
00:58:22,221 --> 00:58:23,184
What are you going to do?

626
00:58:23,243 --> 00:58:25,205
I can't go down without a fight.

627
00:58:25,315 --> 00:58:26,513
Find me a pin, at least.

628
00:58:26,642 --> 00:58:27,828
A... A pin?

629
00:58:27,911 --> 00:58:29,837
Would that be enough?

630
00:58:29,943 --> 00:58:31,211
There's no other way. Find it.

631
00:58:31,282 --> 00:58:33,572
Yes, all right.

632
00:58:34,935 --> 00:58:36,628
Don't dance this time.

633
00:58:36,723 --> 00:58:38,894
Then, you'll be able to
manage one way or another.

634
00:58:39,464 --> 00:58:42,054
Still... It's a dance song...

635
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:45,507
What if you end up half-naked 
on a live broadcast?

636
00:58:54,256 --> 00:58:58,178
Chairman, I found Lee Miju.

637
00:59:00,666 --> 00:59:01,996
Here.

638
00:59:09,301 --> 00:59:10,710
The information we received was right.

639
00:59:10,839 --> 00:59:13,999
Cha Soojeong was really Lee Miju.

640
00:59:15,810 --> 00:59:17,442
Miju...

641
00:59:17,583 --> 00:59:20,720
There's a live performance 
on SBC at four,

642
00:59:20,814 --> 00:59:22,928
and she's debuting there.

643
00:59:59,128 --> 01:00:01,970
Soojeong, it's your turn. Quick.

644
01:00:05,283 --> 01:00:06,269
Don't run.

645
01:00:06,437 --> 01:00:08,478
It'll mess up your image.

646
01:00:11,062 --> 01:00:14,868
Walk out there slowly,
and with your head held up high.

647
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:20,213
You were born to be a star.

648
01:00:21,273 --> 01:00:25,199
If you have no faith
in yourself, believe in me.

649
01:00:27,666 --> 01:00:28,488
Yes.

650
01:00:28,570 --> 01:00:33,691
Go out there and make 
all viewers fall for you.

651
01:01:03,022 --> 01:01:07,026
Seongmo Oppa... Gangmo Oppa...

652
01:01:43,784 --> 01:01:45,441
Miju...

653
01:01:45,793 --> 01:01:47,978

<i>Just for today.
Then I'll never do this again.</i>

661
01:02:14,044 --> 01:02:17,179
As for the model for our apartments,
let's go with Cha Soojeong.

662
01:02:17,288 --> 01:02:20,176
Soojeong! You're about
to star in an apartment CF!

663
01:02:20,258 --> 01:02:21,550
Which company?

664
01:02:21,621 --> 01:02:22,352
<i>Which one?</i>

665
01:02:22,399 --> 01:02:23,985
<i>I'll be honest with you.</i>

666
01:02:24,055 --> 01:02:25,923
I'm trying to build a new business model.

667
01:02:26,005 --> 01:02:27,520
<i>That sorry-ass son of a cunt.</i>

668
01:02:27,591 --> 01:02:29,717
He seems hell-bent on ruining us.

669
01:02:29,811 --> 01:02:31,396
It's pretty obvious our
core technology was leaked.

01:02:31,467 --> 01:02:32,595
<i>We're going to fight it with quality.</i>

671
01:02:32,677 --> 01:02:33,605
<i>He handed in his resignation.</i>

672
01:02:33,687 --> 01:02:35,850
Looks like Lee Gangmo 
found out about him.

673
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:37,631
What do you think you're doing?

674
01:02:37,724 --> 01:02:39,127
<i>Where is Lee Seongmo?</i>

675
01:02:39,245 --> 01:02:41,488
Where is he, you prick?!
