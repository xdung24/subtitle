00:00:11,251 --> 00:00:12,903
<i>I'm here to inform you
this bid has been nullified.</i>

7
00:00:13,017 --> 00:00:15,426
<i>Those committee fools
stabbed us in the back.</i>

8
00:00:15,527 --> 00:00:18,232
<i>And I'd heard you were going around
threatening respectable businessmen...</i>

9
00:00:18,307 --> 00:00:19,669
<i>So the rumors were true.</i>

10
00:00:19,758 --> 00:00:22,950
<i>Find Daeryuk Construction's bidding price.</i>

11
00:00:23,059 --> 00:00:24,437
I'm well aware that
this is no laughing matter.

12
00:00:24,563 --> 00:00:25,989
<i>And that is why I asked you.</i>

13
00:00:26,089 --> 00:00:29,243
Are you asking me to find out
Manbo Construction's bidding price?

14
00:00:29,344 --> 00:00:32,155
Hand me Daeryuk
Construction's bidding plan.

15
00:00:32,245 --> 00:00:35,206
I have this friend working as a
secretary for Daeryuk Construction.

16
00:00:35,332 --> 00:00:37,534
Tell me your bidding price.

17
00:00:37,643 --> 00:00:42,253
But seems that this guy who's helping him
bears a grudge against Hwang Taeseop?!

18
00:00:42,344 --> 00:00:44,367
<i>We must find who that is.</i>

19
00:00:44,499 --> 00:00:47,268
The moment you see my face,
you will die.

20
00:00:47,407 --> 00:00:51,277
I'm sure he will meet with the man
who brought him the bidding plan.

21
00:00:51,387 --> 00:00:54,256
Jo Minwoo just left for the Royal Club.

22
00:00:54,395 --> 00:00:56,034
What?!

23
00:00:58,847 --> 00:01:00,487
~ Episode 12 ~

24
00:01:04,902 --> 00:01:08,610
Know what year Shilla
unified the Three Kingdoms?

25
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:11,587
Not really?!

26
00:01:12,196 --> 00:01:15,072
If we win that subway construction bid,

27
00:01:15,317 --> 00:01:20,142
Manbo Construction will unify
our country's construction business.

28
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:27,983
So your bidding price is just like
the year the Three Kingdoms were unified?

29
00:01:38,951 --> 00:01:40,419
He's here again?!

30
00:01:40,507 --> 00:01:43,156
What if he finds out?

31
00:02:29,664 --> 00:02:31,604
Where is the man
who was here with you?

32
00:02:31,783 --> 00:02:33,115
What are you, trailing me?

33
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:35,755
I asked you who you were here with!

34
00:02:37,404 --> 00:02:41,196
You didn't tell him, did you?

35
00:02:41,468 --> 00:02:41,998
What?

36
00:02:42,124 --> 00:02:44,081
Our bidding price.

37
00:02:44,281 --> 00:02:46,198
You told that man?

38
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:54,259
When it's just the two of us,
don't think I'll ever let you hit me.

39
00:02:54,511 --> 00:02:57,803
<i>Speak!
Did you tell him?</i>

40
00:03:03,126 --> 00:03:07,276
You saw that bidding plan yourself.

41
00:03:07,898 --> 00:03:12,729
Still raising a fuss despite
all that, isn't it laughable?

42
00:03:12,911 --> 00:03:18,077
If he replaced the pages I tore
and gave you that, then what?

43
00:03:18,868 --> 00:03:19,670
What?

44
00:03:19,756 --> 00:03:22,925
Anyone would be capable of such tricks.

45
00:03:31,241 --> 00:03:33,478
You've gotten better.

46
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:36,404
I almost let you fool me.

47
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,141
But, you know?

48
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:41,938
I know you better than you think.

49
00:03:43,241 --> 00:03:45,700
All you're hoping for
is to see me make a mistake,

50
00:03:46,015 --> 00:03:47,850
since you're trying to interfere
with me whatever it takes.

51
00:03:47,988 --> 00:03:49,805
Listen well.

52
00:03:50,004 --> 00:03:52,365
I couldn't care less
about people like you.

53
00:03:52,552 --> 00:03:54,118
The company is what matters to me.

54
00:03:54,232 --> 00:03:57,625
The man you tried to incriminate
is like a brother to me.

55
00:03:57,763 --> 00:03:59,983
He would never try to betray me.

56
00:04:00,185 --> 00:04:02,203
Did I make myself clear?

57
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:19,352
That's quite a feast
you prepared for us today?!

58
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:20,534
This must taste great.

59
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:23,386
Honey, try it out.

60
00:04:23,914 --> 00:04:25,491
<i>Here...</i>

61
00:04:26,714 --> 00:04:27,813
It's all right.

62
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:30,125
My hands are still moving fine.

63
00:04:30,232 --> 00:04:32,086
I just want you to have a balanced diet.

64
00:04:32,174 --> 00:04:34,132
Here, come on...

65
00:04:40,827 --> 00:04:42,828
Did you just laugh at me?

66
00:04:43,421 --> 00:04:44,670
What?

67
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,599
Of course not!

68
00:04:46,965 --> 00:04:49,034
You just looked good together.

69
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,837
When did we ever eat with our maids?

70
00:04:52,036 --> 00:04:53,663
Get out of my face!

71
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:55,000
<i>What's wrong with you, Honey?</i>

72
00:04:55,164 --> 00:04:56,706
I told her to eat with us.

73
00:04:56,815 --> 00:04:59,384
Leave us alone,
or I'll lose my appetite!

74
00:05:04,631 --> 00:05:06,725
You really...

75
00:05:09,954 --> 00:05:11,779
Yes, Hannam-Dong here.

76
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:13,743
<i>Is Chairman Hong Gipyo home?</i>

77
00:05:13,877 --> 00:05:15,169
Just a moment.

78
00:05:15,265 --> 00:05:17,480
<i>You don't need to call him,
just write him a memo.</i>

79
00:05:17,601 --> 00:05:20,007
Ahh... One moment, please.

80
00:05:22,429 --> 00:05:24,231
Go ahead.

81
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:25,502
Yes...

82
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:29,926
Tomorrow at noon,

83
00:05:30,131 --> 00:05:33,544
at the Japanese restaurant in Jong-Ro.

84
00:05:33,656 --> 00:05:35,326
Kimono.

85
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:38,117
Which room did you say again?

86
00:05:38,223 --> 00:05:39,901
Ahh... The Fallen Blossom Room.

87
00:05:39,989 --> 00:05:41,920
Fallen Blossom...

88
00:05:41,998 --> 00:05:43,361
Who's calling?

89
00:05:43,672 --> 00:05:45,305
Hello?

90
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:46,888
He hung up?!

91
00:05:47,027 --> 00:05:49,611
I wrote it all down
on this memo, Chairman.

92
00:06:02,354 --> 00:06:06,755
What should we build on the land around
the subway site, to bolster our profits?

93
00:06:06,887 --> 00:06:09,336
Building an apartment complex
would be the most profitable option,

94
00:06:09,424 --> 00:06:12,363
but considering that the real
estate sector is in a recession...

95
00:06:12,476 --> 00:06:15,559
We can find the missing funds
for our subway construction...

96
00:06:15,711 --> 00:06:17,635
with the profit from building
apartments around the area.

97
00:06:17,761 --> 00:06:21,950
But if we fail to sell them?
Our company itself would risk collapse.

98
00:06:22,064 --> 00:06:23,992
I'll take all the responsibility.

99
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:27,069
<i>Once the bid is over,
draft a plan right away.</i>

100
00:06:27,176 --> 00:06:28,722
All right.

101
00:07:09,007 --> 00:07:10,899
It's driving me crazy.

102
00:07:11,049 --> 00:07:13,789
Why does that dream keep coming to mind?

103
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,702
Let's wake up, Hwang Jeongyeon.

104
00:07:29,954 --> 00:07:33,720
After all I've gone through to get here,
I can't let him laugh at me.

105
00:07:40,707 --> 00:07:42,712
This is the room.

106
00:07:52,827 --> 00:07:54,308
My guest will soon arrive.

107
00:07:54,434 --> 00:07:55,630
We'll order then.

108
00:07:55,728 --> 00:07:57,938
As you wish, Sir.

109
00:08:06,227 --> 00:08:08,343
<i>Chairman Hong Gipyo?</i>

110
00:08:15,935 --> 00:08:17,828
You were there?!

111
00:08:17,952 --> 00:08:19,263
Let me come over.

112
00:08:19,391 --> 00:08:21,451
Just sit there.

113
00:08:26,782 --> 00:08:28,843
How did it go?

114
00:08:29,473 --> 00:08:34,645
Find out which year Shilla
unified the Three Kingdoms.

115
00:08:35,578 --> 00:08:37,392
And why are you suddenly...

116
00:08:37,571 --> 00:08:42,246
That will tell you the
amount you're looking for.

117
00:08:43,861 --> 00:08:45,501
Then...

118
00:08:47,168 --> 00:08:49,524
I've fulfilled my task,

119
00:08:49,713 --> 00:08:55,878
so bringing Manbo Construction to
its destruction is your responsibility.

120
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:05,325
I'm really thankful.

121
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,201
How can I repay your generosity?

122
00:09:08,445 --> 00:09:10,806
I want to reciprocate
for what you did.

123
00:09:10,897 --> 00:09:12,818
Just tell me.

124
00:09:15,317 --> 00:09:17,474
Are you listening to me?

125
00:09:34,967 --> 00:09:36,177
<i>Look, Chief Kim.</i>

126
00:09:36,278 --> 00:09:39,904
Rewrite our plan, and lower
the price whatever it takes.

127
00:09:40,232 --> 00:09:43,171
As for the plan, all it will take is
some hard work from our employees, but...

128
00:09:43,272 --> 00:09:45,164
But what's the problem?

129
00:09:45,361 --> 00:09:48,515
Even if we win the bid, at that
price we would still be in trouble.

130
00:09:48,696 --> 00:09:53,491
If we win, we can always find a way to
cover our missing funds, so don't worry.

131
00:09:54,017 --> 00:09:55,997
The unification of the Three Kingdoms?!

132
00:09:56,124 --> 00:09:58,179
<i>Listen to that...</i>

133
00:10:05,888 --> 00:10:10,756
I apologize for what
happened at the Royal Club.

134
00:10:10,866 --> 00:10:13,392
Let's just pretend
it was a confession of guilt,

135
00:10:13,594 --> 00:10:19,024
since there's nothing else
to hide between us now.

136
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:23,311
Not long ago, I had a chance
to meet with Oh Byeongtak.

137
00:10:23,421 --> 00:10:25,472
Congressman Oh told me.

138
00:10:25,594 --> 00:10:27,525
So you want a recommendation
to join the the Republican Party?

139
00:10:27,651 --> 00:10:30,085
I'll get straight to the point.

140
00:10:30,502 --> 00:10:34,184
These elections are
all about money, anyway.

141
00:10:34,999 --> 00:10:40,071
Let's just agree that whoever
loses the subway bid will step aside.

142
00:10:40,283 --> 00:10:41,696
So that means you're
confident that you'll win?

143
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:45,821
Just that we shouldn't
waste time with attrition warfare.

144
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,020
Yes.

145
00:10:51,188 --> 00:10:52,534
<i>Director.</i>

146
00:10:52,763 --> 00:10:56,088
<i>I found out Manbo
Construction's bidding price.</i>

147
00:10:58,512 --> 00:11:00,379
I see.

148
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:06,106
Where were we?

149
00:11:06,226 --> 00:11:08,085
Ohh... Attrition warfare.

150
00:11:08,323 --> 00:11:09,283
Fine.

151
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:12,701
No need to fight
each other so strenuously.

152
00:11:12,827 --> 00:11:14,190
Are you agreeing?

153
00:11:14,292 --> 00:11:18,430
If one loses the subway bid, what
would they use to fund their candidacy?

154
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:21,003
Let's just avoid unpleasantries
to compete with each other.

155
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:23,816
That's exactly what I was thinking.

156
00:11:37,974 --> 00:11:39,826
Jo Pilyeon.

157
00:11:40,017 --> 00:11:43,437
You'll soon stop putting on airs.

158
00:11:43,624 --> 00:11:48,085
I really can't figure out how
he can be so confident about all this.

159
00:11:49,272 --> 00:11:50,898
How did what I told you to do go?

160
00:11:51,062 --> 00:11:52,676
We're proceeding well.

161
00:11:52,865 --> 00:11:54,384
You don't need to worry.

162
00:11:54,479 --> 00:11:58,034
Until the winner is announced,
you can't let your guard down.

163
00:11:58,143 --> 00:12:00,034
No need to mention it, Director.

164
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,971
Right... What is Lee Seongmo
doing, these days?

165
00:12:04,128 --> 00:12:08,517
Actually, I've heard very
surprising news concerning him.

166
00:12:24,304 --> 00:12:25,928
You're back?

167
00:12:26,061 --> 00:12:28,488
I've come more than once,
but I found no one here.

168
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:30,250
Were you busy?

169
00:12:30,864 --> 00:12:33,826
I had a few issues to deal with.

170
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:35,698
What issues?

171
00:12:37,596 --> 00:12:40,197
Don't you know
the situation we are in?

172
00:12:40,335 --> 00:12:43,199
Thought you could fool me?

173
00:12:44,473 --> 00:12:45,696
Just be honest.

174
00:12:45,835 --> 00:12:47,850
I already know what you did.

175
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:54,026
What's with all the surprise?

176
00:12:54,121 --> 00:12:58,025
"I did a favor to Minwoo,"
couldn't you just admit it?

177
00:12:58,641 --> 00:12:59,892
Well done.

178
00:13:00,056 --> 00:13:03,539
Seongmo, you really did us proud.

179
00:13:03,726 --> 00:13:06,303
If it involves Minwoo,
then it involves me.

180
00:13:06,476 --> 00:13:09,810
Shall we go out for a drink?

181
00:13:14,371 --> 00:13:20,349
I never thought Jo Minwoo
would believe what you said,

182
00:13:20,526 --> 00:13:21,547
but still!

183
00:13:21,653 --> 00:13:24,651
Shouldn't at least
the chairman believe you?

184
00:13:24,744 --> 00:13:26,398
<i>I mean...</i>

185
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:32,729
Honestly, where else would you find
someone as loyal to him as you here?

186
00:13:33,865 --> 00:13:35,763
<i>Don't move.</i>

187
00:13:37,953 --> 00:13:40,001
It's a revolver.

188
00:13:40,433 --> 00:13:42,929
Try anything funny, and you're dead.

189
00:13:43,538 --> 00:13:47,079
<i>Ahh... The more I think about it,
the angrier it makes me.</i>

190
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:49,208
Hey, you.

191
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:52,116
Who did I just speak with?

192
00:13:52,734 --> 00:13:56,997
So you haven't listened
to a word I said all along?

193
00:13:57,237 --> 00:13:59,532
What are you thinking about?

194
00:14:00,428 --> 00:14:03,783
If the man who helped Jo Minwoo
is the same one I met,

195
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:06,179
then there is a way to stop him.

196
00:14:06,361 --> 00:14:07,516
What?

197
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:11,098
So...

198
00:14:11,328 --> 00:14:13,944
What is it you wanted to tell me?

199
00:14:14,264 --> 00:14:18,783
I am sure the man who told Daeryuk
Construction's bidding price to Chief Jo...

200
00:14:18,968 --> 00:14:21,215
is a KCIA agent.

201
00:14:21,868 --> 00:14:23,319
I guess so.

202
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:27,751
There is no way Jo Minwoo wouldn't
have used his father's influence.

203
00:14:27,961 --> 00:14:30,875
Find out who that man is.

204
00:14:31,013 --> 00:14:35,504
Are you still believing
Chief Jo is a spy?

205
00:14:35,615 --> 00:14:41,136
I never disappointed the chairman
even once all these years.

206
00:14:41,403 --> 00:14:46,633
I'm sure there is some kind of
conspiracy at play here.

207
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:51,714
Find out who is the
man who helped Chief Jo.

208
00:14:52,107 --> 00:14:56,427
Now that you mention it, I'm having
a drink with Director Jo tonight,

209
00:14:56,597 --> 00:14:59,145
so I'll give it a try.

210
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:01,836
I will follow you there.

211
00:15:09,592 --> 00:15:14,076
Minwoo will keep needing
your help in the future.

212
00:15:14,283 --> 00:15:17,746
You should have
invited him here as well.

213
00:15:20,206 --> 00:15:23,636
Aigoo, seems like we are a little late.

214
00:15:23,762 --> 00:15:27,689
How can someone who calls
you out for a drink be late?

215
00:15:27,933 --> 00:15:30,077
My apologies.

216
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:34,517
I see you've come as well.

217
00:15:34,828 --> 00:15:40,584
<i>I brought him here as encouragement
for all the hard work that awaits him.</i>

218
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:44,117
I trust I can let him
share the table with us?

219
00:15:44,369 --> 00:15:45,984
Naturally.

220
00:15:46,526 --> 00:15:47,607
Have a seat.

221
00:15:47,838 --> 00:15:49,548
Thank you.

222
00:15:53,325 --> 00:15:55,602
<i>Here, drink to your heart's content.</i>

223
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:59,128
I'm sparing no expenses today.

224
00:15:59,254 --> 00:16:00,495
Thank you.

225
00:16:00,641 --> 00:16:03,210
Here, let me pour you
a drink, Chairman Hwang.

226
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:09,256
But...

227
00:16:09,445 --> 00:16:16,081
Who was the man who helped Chief Jo?

228
00:16:17,304 --> 00:16:20,344
Why are you asking?

229
00:16:21,101 --> 00:16:26,434
He helped us so much,
I thought I'd pay back the courtesy.

230
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:29,608
And what would that mean?

231
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:34,250
Well... Why wouldn't I
give him whatever he asks for?

232
00:16:35,767 --> 00:16:37,832
You won't get too
many chances like this.

233
00:16:38,135 --> 00:16:41,081
Tell him what you want.

234
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:45,937
So was it him?

235
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,040
I need no reward.

236
00:16:49,683 --> 00:16:50,923
Don't say that.

237
00:16:51,121 --> 00:16:52,957
Go ahead and tell me.

238
00:16:53,197 --> 00:16:57,838
I just ask you to keep supporting the
director, even after you win the bid.

239
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:03,250
That's the kind of man
we're dealing with.

240
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:08,351
<i>Let's have a toast,
to our neverending development.</i>

241
00:17:08,511 --> 00:17:09,370
Cheers.

242
00:17:09,533 --> 00:17:11,312
Cheers.

243
00:17:27,624 --> 00:17:32,719
How did you get your hands on
Daeryuk Construction's bidding plan?

244
00:17:35,104 --> 00:17:37,000
What is moving you to ask that?

245
00:17:37,105 --> 00:17:39,491
It's just natural to ask it.

246
00:17:41,196 --> 00:17:44,476
So you want to extort
intelligence from a KCIA agent?!

247
00:17:45,159 --> 00:17:47,402
Quite daring, I see.

248
00:17:49,124 --> 00:17:52,416
If you're here to accompany
those higher-ups, just drink quietly.

249
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:57,310
You must be the one
who pointed a gun at me?

250
00:17:59,086 --> 00:18:02,801
The voice of that man who
promised I'd die if I saw him...

251
00:18:05,538 --> 00:18:08,104
I can clearly remember it.

252
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:18,905
You must have been bruised in the head.

253
00:18:19,214 --> 00:18:23,067
May I take a look?

254
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:45,453
I'll just pretend you forgot for
a moment whom you're dealing with.

255
00:18:47,672 --> 00:18:51,381
What is this grudge you bear
against the chairman?

256
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:55,379
What could it possibly be,

257
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:58,419
if you even help Daeryuk Construction
behind our backs, and...

258
00:19:03,649 --> 00:19:05,608
Careful.

259
00:19:06,046 --> 00:19:08,604
You might be working for Chairman Hwang,

260
00:19:08,712 --> 00:19:11,923
but I won't tolerate
any more of your antics.

261
00:19:26,526 --> 00:19:28,864
That Lee Seongmo...

262
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:31,705
Director Jo seems to really trust him.

263
00:19:31,801 --> 00:19:35,609
Is he really called Lee Seongmo?

264
00:19:36,661 --> 00:19:37,865
That's what I've heard.

265
00:19:38,023 --> 00:19:39,336
Why?

266
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:40,535
It's nothing.

267
00:19:40,642 --> 00:19:42,994
It's just that he and someone
I know have the same name.

268
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:48,796
Seems like he risked his life
more than once for Director Jo's sake.

269
00:19:48,957 --> 00:19:52,226
So there's no reason to suspect him.

270
00:19:52,365 --> 00:19:57,678
He's one of Jo's closest confidants,
there's no way he'd help Hong Gipyo.

271
00:19:58,338 --> 00:19:59,549
Have a good night.

272
00:19:59,663 --> 00:20:01,261
Right...

273
00:20:05,007 --> 00:20:07,000
Lee Seongmo?!

274
00:20:09,239 --> 00:20:12,001
He's Manbo Construction's
Chief of Services.

275
00:20:12,207 --> 00:20:15,141
Find whatever you can about him.

276
00:20:15,394 --> 00:20:17,235
I will.

277
00:20:32,427 --> 00:20:33,791
What's the matter?

278
00:20:33,948 --> 00:20:34,989
How about Jo Minwoo?

279
00:20:35,135 --> 00:20:38,803
Everyone's busy beyond belief.
I have to go back, too.

280
00:20:39,525 --> 00:20:45,273
How much would it take to write one
of those bidding documents from scratch?

281
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:50,053
If they present that to the bid,
it might get us into trouble.

282
00:20:50,217 --> 00:20:52,251
I've heard from Chief Jo.

283
00:20:52,341 --> 00:20:54,515
Aren't you overreacting?

284
00:20:54,667 --> 00:20:56,395
Agasshi...

285
00:20:56,874 --> 00:20:58,148
Even you can't trust me?

286
00:20:58,274 --> 00:21:01,916
It's not that I don't trust you...
Everyone makes mistakes.

287
00:21:02,373 --> 00:21:04,619
I told you I met him firsthand!

288
00:21:04,732 --> 00:21:07,556
That man who's helping Jo Minwoo
is working for Hong Gipyo!

289
00:21:07,657 --> 00:21:09,310
The bid is right around the corner.

290
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:11,469
What are we supposed to do,
without any solid evidence?

291
00:21:11,558 --> 00:21:15,452
So you just let them fool you
right under your noses like a retard?

292
00:21:22,121 --> 00:21:25,854
Even Jo Minwoo can make mistakes.

293
00:21:26,586 --> 00:21:29,196
And we can't let that
compromise our company's future.

294
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,863
By no means.

295
00:21:33,856 --> 00:21:40,125
I've never seen you
get so angry at me before.

296
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:45,761
I'm sorry.

297
00:21:46,329 --> 00:21:49,255
Even you only trust Jo Minwoo,

298
00:21:49,495 --> 00:21:51,809
so I guess it made me angrier.

299
00:21:54,426 --> 00:21:56,541
Wasn't bad.

300
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:00,439
Even if just for a little while,
you looked like a man.

301
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:04,332
I'll talk to Chief Jo.
Happy now?

302
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,018
Where are you going,
when we're all so busy?

303
00:22:21,254 --> 00:22:23,386
Review this.

304
00:22:23,727 --> 00:22:25,181
I...

305
00:22:26,998 --> 00:22:29,083
I'd like a word.

306
00:22:29,886 --> 00:22:32,303
Didn't you just hear we're busy?

307
00:22:41,181 --> 00:22:44,066
If what Gangmo says is right, then what?

308
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,004
Did you just meet with Lee Gangmo?

309
00:22:46,093 --> 00:22:48,886
I know Gangmo well.

310
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,211
- He's not the kind who would just say...
- Are you out of your mind?

311
00:22:52,308 --> 00:22:55,412
If you have all that spare time,
use it on the counter.

312
00:22:55,516 --> 00:22:58,187
Even just 10 won out of place,
and our bid is canceled.

313
00:22:58,376 --> 00:23:01,895
Still, checking one last time,
just in case you made a mistake...

314
00:23:01,971 --> 00:23:03,320
<i>What this boils down to...</i>

315
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:06,839
is the fact you trust
Lee Gangmo more than me.

316
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:10,585
Then, go to him.

317
00:23:10,842 --> 00:23:13,852
I don't need anyone working under me,
if they can't trust me.

318
00:23:25,814 --> 00:23:27,126
<i>He's an orphan,</i>

319
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:30,618
and Hwang Taeseop has been
raising him since his childhood.

320
00:23:31,439 --> 00:23:32,663
What's his name?

321
00:23:32,837 --> 00:23:34,923
Lee Gangmo.

322
00:23:36,247 --> 00:23:37,907
Lee Gangmo?!

323
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:42,150
It's just like the name of
the brother you were looking for,

324
00:23:42,314 --> 00:23:47,032
and turns out he's not from
Busan, but Jong-Ro in Seoul.

325
00:23:47,246 --> 00:23:49,653
<i>Chairman Hwang is like a father to him.</i>

326
00:23:49,779 --> 00:23:51,104
He's also quite resourceful,

327
00:23:51,255 --> 00:23:55,417
so whenever there's something difficult
to handle at work, he takes care of it.

328
00:23:59,618 --> 00:24:01,362
Yes.

329
00:24:04,504 --> 00:24:07,528
So you found someone
who knows Lee Gangmo?

330
00:24:15,797 --> 00:24:19,761
The photo really doesn't help,

331
00:24:19,861 --> 00:24:23,638
but I can confirm a Lee Gangmo
worked at our factory.

332
00:24:23,949 --> 00:24:26,992
Are you sure he's from Busan?

333
00:24:27,131 --> 00:24:31,240
He's from there,
and about the same age.

334
00:24:31,861 --> 00:24:33,869
Then, do you know where he is now?

335
00:24:33,982 --> 00:24:35,937
Or maybe even a contact number?

336
00:24:36,051 --> 00:24:40,438
If you'll pardon me asking,
what's your relationship with him?

337
00:24:40,566 --> 00:24:44,539
He's the younger brother
I lost back when we were little.

338
00:24:44,821 --> 00:24:48,341
I see...

339
00:24:50,397 --> 00:24:55,177
Gangmo, that fella, has passed away.

340
00:25:01,365 --> 00:25:03,799
Passed... away?!

341
00:25:04,821 --> 00:25:09,147
Last year, there was
a fire at the factory, and...

342
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:13,575
<i>Seonbaenim...</i>

343
00:25:19,709 --> 00:25:22,090
His grave...

344
00:25:23,642 --> 00:25:25,969
Where is his grave?

345
00:25:27,534 --> 00:25:30,295
Because we couldn't find his family,

346
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:33,892
we cremated him, and spread
his ashes in the Han River.

347
00:25:33,961 --> 00:25:37,875
Shouldn't there be
at least some relics left?

348
00:25:40,083 --> 00:25:42,877
I am sorry.

349
00:25:58,382 --> 00:25:59,579
Did you find out?

350
00:25:59,675 --> 00:26:01,731
Don't get me started.

351
00:26:01,831 --> 00:26:04,912
We should be glad my friend
works as a guard at the KCIA.

352
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:07,829
If it weren't for him, I wouldn't
even have gotten inside the building.

353
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:10,093
Where is that Lee Seongmo from?

354
00:26:10,272 --> 00:26:11,797
He didn't know that,

355
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:14,031
but he said he's from the 8th US Army.

356
00:26:14,321 --> 00:26:16,124
The 8th Army?!

357
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:19,353
That's where he first met
Director Jo Pilyeon.

358
00:26:20,224 --> 00:26:22,428
Seeing as he has no previous record,

359
00:26:22,538 --> 00:26:24,458
he probably comes from the US.

360
00:26:24,623 --> 00:26:26,956
Aigoo... What was it again?

361
00:26:27,511 --> 00:26:28,978
Ohh... G. I.

362
00:26:29,138 --> 00:26:32,733
You know, all those Koreans
who come back with American passports.

363
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:39,759
Why, is it the first time you
see people with the same name?

364
00:26:40,417 --> 00:26:43,910
It'll be much quicker
to look for your sister.

365
00:26:44,049 --> 00:26:46,168
<i>I'll find her for you.</i>

366
00:26:53,929 --> 00:26:56,023
Halmeoni!

367
00:26:58,192 --> 00:26:59,628
Have you sold a lot of rice cakes?

368
00:26:59,721 --> 00:27:01,999
Aigoo... Look who's here.

369
00:27:02,091 --> 00:27:04,549
Came to meet your brothers again?

370
00:27:04,633 --> 00:27:07,820
No, I ran an errand nearby.

371
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:09,161
Give me a few, while we're here.

372
00:27:09,237 --> 00:27:12,314
I was wondering why you
hadn't been around, these days.

373
00:27:12,491 --> 00:27:14,660
I only come here
the last day of the month.

374
00:27:14,774 --> 00:27:17,372
We promised each other
we'd meet on that day.

375
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:19,241
Wait a moment.

376
00:27:19,619 --> 00:27:23,142
Now that I think about it,
once a month,

377
00:27:23,235 --> 00:27:27,131
there was this fella
always waiting for someone?

378
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:29,748
Really, Halmeoni?

379
00:27:30,025 --> 00:27:35,102
Yeah... I've been selling
cakes here for about a year,

380
00:27:35,245 --> 00:27:37,927
and he's come every single time.

381
00:27:38,102 --> 00:27:43,023
But I haven't seen him
around the last few months?!

382
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:54,233
<i>You're here again?</i>

383
00:27:55,558 --> 00:27:57,790
Have you sold a lot?

384
00:27:58,068 --> 00:28:00,061
Have you had dinner?

385
00:28:00,187 --> 00:28:02,500
I'll have a few rice cakes.

386
00:28:03,055 --> 00:28:08,579
Who on earth are you waiting for,
even skipping meals?

387
00:28:15,912 --> 00:28:21,726
She must be much hungrier than me.

388
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:27,642
You don't look like
you're married with children,

389
00:28:27,856 --> 00:28:32,466
so is the person you're
waiting for your sister?

390
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:35,538
How much is it?

391
00:28:35,948 --> 00:28:41,447
Look at me,
never minding my business.

392
00:29:09,054 --> 00:29:16,916
<i>He'd always wait and
keep waiting, until curfew.</i>

393
00:29:18,366 --> 00:29:19,439
Anything else?

394
00:29:19,566 --> 00:29:23,298
His name, where he lives...
Have you asked that?

395
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:27,430
Aigoo... He was a man of few words...

396
00:29:27,554 --> 00:29:32,010
But is that the man you're looking for?

397
00:29:33,937 --> 00:29:36,122
<i>Aigoo, what now?</i>

398
00:29:36,289 --> 00:29:38,279
Looks like you missed each other.

399
00:29:38,405 --> 00:29:42,520
Aigoo, that's so sad...

400
00:29:45,744 --> 00:29:49,167
Don't let it sadden you too much.

401
00:29:49,343 --> 00:29:54,180
If it's in your destiny to meet,
one day you will.

402
00:29:58,544 --> 00:30:03,816
I wonder why there are so
many people suffering like you.

403
00:30:15,094 --> 00:30:16,820
Seongmo Oppa...

404
00:30:16,933 --> 00:30:18,961
Gangmo Oppa...

405
00:30:19,055 --> 00:30:21,601
Miju is here.

406
00:30:21,711 --> 00:30:24,996
Where on earth are you?

407
00:31:06,407 --> 00:31:08,538
Gangmo...

408
00:31:12,373 --> 00:31:15,766
I should have protected you...

409
00:31:20,439 --> 00:31:22,343
I'm sorry.

410
00:31:25,951 --> 00:31:28,612
I'm sorry, Gangmo.

411
00:31:30,643 --> 00:31:33,637
I'm sorry...

412
00:31:40,789 --> 00:31:43,261
Your brother is here.

413
00:31:44,813 --> 00:31:47,663
Your brother is here, Gangmo!

414
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:52,194
Gangmo, I'm here!

415
00:31:53,364 --> 00:31:56,303
Lee Gangmo!

416
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:01,949
Gangmo...

417
00:32:13,296 --> 00:32:15,722
Gangmo...

418
00:32:57,194 --> 00:32:58,683
Here, folks!

419
00:32:59,048 --> 00:33:01,319
Good job, everyone.

420
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:08,256
We matched the bidding price
without a single blemish.

421
00:33:08,921 --> 00:33:10,397
Let me say this again,

422
00:33:10,535 --> 00:33:15,663
but Daeryuk Construction is trying
its damnedest to find our bidding price.

423
00:33:16,224 --> 00:33:19,188
Until the bid is over, secrecy is a must,

424
00:33:19,365 --> 00:33:21,736
one you must never forget.

425
00:33:30,796 --> 00:33:32,171
<i>It hurts, Mom!</i>

426
00:33:32,246 --> 00:33:34,416
Hurry up and speak.
What did you do with it?

427
00:33:34,517 --> 00:33:37,851
It hurts! Let go!

428
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:42,341
The three million I gave you
to find out their bidding price!

429
00:33:42,467 --> 00:33:45,217
Just have some patience,
they'll call me soon.

430
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:48,269
The bid is today, when is
that ever going to happen?

431
00:33:48,446 --> 00:33:50,189
It's... It's today?!

432
00:33:50,287 --> 00:33:53,512
You'll drive me crazy.

433
00:33:54,885 --> 00:33:58,064
What's all this noise?

434
00:33:59,033 --> 00:34:00,832
So today's the day, isn't it?

435
00:34:00,905 --> 00:34:02,995
Go there and beat them all, Dad!

436
00:34:03,134 --> 00:34:06,286
Where are you prancing
around all day, as of late?

437
00:34:06,632 --> 00:34:08,135
Prancing around?!

438
00:34:08,224 --> 00:34:10,796
I spend all day reading at home.

439
00:34:10,978 --> 00:34:12,795
Isn't that right, Mom?

440
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:18,533
Aww... Just go easy on that.
Your eyesight will suffer.

441
00:34:18,685 --> 00:34:21,123
Listen to that...

442
00:34:21,238 --> 00:34:25,759
If we win the subway bid,
come back to work.

443
00:34:25,948 --> 00:34:26,849
What?

444
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,019
Honey!

445
00:34:28,218 --> 00:34:29,671
Do you mean that?

446
00:34:30,539 --> 00:34:33,616
You can finally kiss
being a freeloader goodbye.

447
00:34:33,782 --> 00:34:34,851
Thank you, Dad.

448
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:37,389
I'll really do my best.

449
00:34:38,007 --> 00:34:39,270
Move.

450
00:34:39,996 --> 00:34:41,905
Thank you, Dad.

451
00:34:42,737 --> 00:34:45,303
<i>Have a nice day, Dear.</i>

452
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,520
What's with your father?

453
00:34:49,243 --> 00:34:53,225
Mom. This time, forget about me
working at the construction site.

454
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:54,476
Then, where?

455
00:34:54,573 --> 00:34:55,903
Where should I ask him to send you?

456
00:34:56,016 --> 00:34:58,639
Jeongyeon is in the
planning team, so forget that.

457
00:34:58,767 --> 00:35:00,374
The secre...

458
00:35:00,541 --> 00:35:02,799
Anyhow... You know, whatever
gives you more influence.

459
00:35:02,925 --> 00:35:04,275
All right.

460
00:35:04,338 --> 00:35:08,879
I'll talk it out with Chief Moon, and
find you the best position in the company.

461
00:35:09,068 --> 00:35:11,136
You just wait.

462
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:14,340
Jeongyeon, Minwoo...
You're all done!

463
00:35:14,454 --> 00:35:18,065
Aigoo... Aigoo!
My darling...

464
00:35:24,144 --> 00:35:27,751
<i>~ Seoul Subway Construction Selection Bid ~</i>

465
00:35:55,120 --> 00:36:01,475
We just completed our review
of the bidding plans you submitted.

466
00:36:01,651 --> 00:36:08,475
<i>In a half hour, at noon,
we will announce the results.</i>

467
00:36:23,144 --> 00:36:26,234
If I'd found out their price,
I would have told you already.

468
00:36:26,394 --> 00:36:30,340
All they talked about was Unified
Three Kingdoms this and that...

469
00:36:30,683 --> 00:36:32,953
Unified Three Kingdoms?!

470
00:36:33,256 --> 00:36:38,607
But what's with the chairman,
and all that "Unified Three Kingdoms" talk?

471
00:36:38,713 --> 00:36:41,410
But maybe he meant
unified north and south?

472
00:36:41,584 --> 00:36:44,109
Educated people being so ignorant...

473
00:36:44,268 --> 00:36:45,961
Did you say Unified Three Kingdoms?

474
00:36:46,046 --> 00:36:47,639
That's what I said.

475
00:36:47,737 --> 00:36:50,441
Unified Three Kingdoms...

476
00:36:52,988 --> 00:36:55,253
Unified Three Kingdoms.

477
00:36:55,361 --> 00:36:57,428
The year 676.

478
00:36:58,349 --> 00:36:59,988
What's wrong with you?

479
00:37:00,077 --> 00:37:02,927
Are you that happy,
that they unified them?

480
00:37:03,305 --> 00:37:04,756
We're not too late, are we?

481
00:37:04,882 --> 00:37:07,276
They'll soon announce
the results, let's go in.

482
00:37:07,806 --> 00:37:09,585
<i>Wait a moment!</i>

483
00:37:15,601 --> 00:37:17,783
67.6 billion won.

484
00:37:22,572 --> 00:37:24,464
Is that right?

485
00:37:25,297 --> 00:37:29,219
Our bidding price
is 67.6 billion won, right?

486
00:37:29,571 --> 00:37:32,246
How could you be aware of that?

487
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:37,254
Where have you heard that?

488
00:37:38,024 --> 00:37:39,420
Tell me!

489
00:37:39,514 --> 00:37:42,035
Where do you think? Uh?

490
00:37:42,271 --> 00:37:43,885
I heard it from them.

491
00:37:43,971 --> 00:37:46,563
Do you get it now, Jo Minwoo?

492
00:37:57,055 --> 00:37:59,249
<i>I will now announce the results.</i>

493
00:38:01,343 --> 00:38:06,611
The subway construction
is hereby awarded to,

494
00:38:13,182 --> 00:38:18,267
with a total bidding price
of 67.55 billion won,

495
00:38:20,008 --> 00:38:23,502
<i>Daeryuk Construction.</i>

496
00:38:53,916 --> 00:39:00,176
You must have worked so hard,
I'll have to apologize to you.

497
00:39:00,403 --> 00:39:02,182
You bastards...

498
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:06,306
I'll make the best
Seoul subway possible.

499
00:39:07,522 --> 00:39:10,885
Who did this to me?

500
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:16,635
<i>At the bid, don't forget
to thank Chairman Hwang's son.</i>

501
00:39:16,799 --> 00:39:18,678
Ahh... Right!

502
00:39:19,052 --> 00:39:22,172
Extend my gratitude to your son.

503
00:39:22,424 --> 00:39:25,514
I'm sure he'll understand what I mean.

504
00:39:28,174 --> 00:39:30,747
What kind of crap...

505
00:39:33,203 --> 00:39:34,872
Chief Jo!

506
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,849
Jo Minwoo! Where has
that little bastard gone?

507
00:40:04,795 --> 00:40:06,704
I just heard the news.

508
00:40:06,893 --> 00:40:09,088
That the subway construction was awarded...

509
00:40:10,616 --> 00:40:13,328
- Search his desk.
- Yes, Director.

510
00:40:13,782 --> 00:40:15,156
What are you doing?

511
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:16,947
Why, don't you know already?

512
00:40:17,178 --> 00:40:20,019
The plan you gave him was a fake!

513
00:40:20,488 --> 00:40:22,295
Speak.

514
00:40:23,363 --> 00:40:24,864
<i>How did you find that?</i>

515
00:40:25,015 --> 00:40:27,151
<i>Who did you plan all this with?</i>

516
00:40:27,614 --> 00:40:29,001
Director!

517
00:40:31,511 --> 00:40:33,919
What is this photo?

518
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:40,834
Isn't this Chairman Hwang's son?

519
00:40:41,742 --> 00:40:46,781
The man he's with is a
Daeryuk Construction secretary.

520
00:40:47,406 --> 00:40:48,717
What?!

521
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:54,147
If any intel was leaked,
Chairman Hwang's son is responsible.

522
00:41:07,216 --> 00:41:09,039
Bring me Jo Minwoo!

523
00:41:09,171 --> 00:41:11,183
Where did he run to?

524
00:41:11,284 --> 00:41:12,777
Calm down, Chairman.

525
00:41:12,868 --> 00:41:14,140
Let go!

526
00:41:14,304 --> 00:41:18,538
With our company facing collapse,
should I really calm down?

527
00:41:27,607 --> 00:41:32,011
He destroyed the tower we fought
so hard to build, all in one strike?!

528
00:41:32,185 --> 00:41:35,964
Quite the skilled son you have.

529
00:41:36,123 --> 00:41:38,193
That's for me to tell you.

530
00:41:40,386 --> 00:41:41,471
Here...

531
00:41:41,634 --> 00:41:44,601
Take a good look at this photo.

532
00:41:46,688 --> 00:41:48,568
And what is this?

533
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:56,451
It's your son, the one who sold
intel to Daeryuk Construction!

534
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,413
What?

535
00:42:06,132 --> 00:42:07,602
<i>Ahh... Right!</i>

536
00:42:07,715 --> 00:42:10,584
Extend my gratitude to your son.

537
00:42:10,788 --> 00:42:13,850
I'm sure he'll understand what I mean.

538
00:42:18,063 --> 00:42:21,443
That motherless little fool!

539
00:42:25,177 --> 00:42:29,014
Ahh... Pathetic fool...

540
00:42:29,355 --> 00:42:30,894
Careful.

541
00:42:31,007 --> 00:42:33,382
Look at my son's skin.

542
00:42:33,489 --> 00:42:37,244
Ajumma.
Bring some more cucumber.

543
00:42:37,352 --> 00:42:39,853
I'm coming.

544
00:42:41,985 --> 00:42:44,729
Cucumber's so expensive these days...

545
00:42:45,113 --> 00:42:48,966
He's coming back to work tomorrow,
is cucumber the matter now?

546
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:49,881
Mom.

547
00:42:49,982 --> 00:42:53,672
I need a suit
if I am to go back to work.

548
00:42:53,761 --> 00:42:54,601
<i>- A suit?
- Yeah.</i>

549
00:42:54,689 --> 00:42:56,594
<i>Where the hell is Jeongshik?</i>

550
00:42:56,897 --> 00:42:58,372
Looks like Dad is back.

551
00:42:58,461 --> 00:43:01,097
- The cucumber will fall off.
- Where is that little bastard?

552
00:43:01,198 --> 00:43:02,484
Jeongshik, you stop there!

553
00:43:02,585 --> 00:43:04,124
Honey, are you back?

554
00:43:04,238 --> 00:43:06,527
I prepared wine to celebrate.

555
00:43:06,616 --> 00:43:08,195
<i>Shut up!</i>

556
00:43:08,322 --> 00:43:09,739
You little motherless fool.

557
00:43:09,834 --> 00:43:12,406
What mess did you get us into?

558
00:43:12,529 --> 00:43:15,287
Ahh... Dad... What did I do now?

559
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:20,656
Did you meet with a Daeryuk
Construction employee, or not?

560
00:43:22,754 --> 00:43:25,918
Dad... That was my mistake...

561
00:43:26,012 --> 00:43:29,855
You goddamned, useless twat!

562
00:43:30,044 --> 00:43:32,340
I just ought to...

563
00:43:37,421 --> 00:43:41,621
Today, you and I will both
get it over with and die!

564
00:43:41,735 --> 00:43:44,068
What are you doing,
are you out of your mind?

565
00:43:44,169 --> 00:43:47,184
Come here...

566
00:43:49,908 --> 00:43:51,191
Dad.

567
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,948
All this for just three million won?

568
00:43:53,011 --> 00:43:54,950
Say what?

569
00:43:57,779 --> 00:43:58,801
Come here!

570
00:43:58,864 --> 00:44:01,374
What's wrong with you, Dad?
Mom... Stop him.

571
00:44:01,452 --> 00:44:02,812
Honey, calm down.

572
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:04,892
He's our one and only son!

573
00:44:04,955 --> 00:44:07,332
Chairman, please, calm down.

574
00:44:07,432 --> 00:44:08,990
Let me go!

575
00:44:09,382 --> 00:44:11,598
What? Our only son?!

576
00:44:11,688 --> 00:44:14,764
I don't want a son like that!

577
00:44:20,803 --> 00:44:22,468
He must have gone batty,
just find refuge.

578
00:44:22,594 --> 00:44:26,100
Ahh... Really!
The hell with this!

579
00:44:26,189 --> 00:44:28,459
Where are you running to?

580
00:44:29,562 --> 00:44:32,234
I'm sorry, Honey.

581
00:44:33,182 --> 00:44:36,550
Hit me instead.
Don't hurt Jeongshik, Honey...

582
00:44:36,663 --> 00:44:38,366
<i>Honey, I'm so sorry...</i>

583
00:44:38,454 --> 00:44:40,926
Blame it all on me, will you?

584
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:42,579
Where are you going?

585
00:44:42,642 --> 00:44:44,687
Let go.
Let me go!

586
00:44:44,773 --> 00:44:48,217
- You didn't do that, right?
- I did what?

587
00:44:48,972 --> 00:44:50,988
Go tell my mother
to bring me some money.

588
00:44:51,082 --> 00:44:53,565
My shoes as well.

589
00:44:56,125 --> 00:44:59,176
I have no idea what is going on.

590
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:02,783
He didn't do that.

591
00:45:03,086 --> 00:45:05,646
He could have never
known our bidding price.

592
00:45:05,858 --> 00:45:08,068
Then, just as you said...

593
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:14,671
Jo Minwoo was used by that KCIA agent.

594
00:45:17,070 --> 00:45:19,842
Minwoo worked harder than ever before,

595
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:22,743
but now he becomes a traitor
in a matter of moments...

596
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:25,777
Think of how disheartened he'll be.

597
00:45:45,926 --> 00:45:49,036
May I sit here?

598
00:45:54,614 --> 00:45:58,919
I've been looking at you for a while...
Seems like you have no company?

599
00:46:06,009 --> 00:46:10,073
You looked like you
needed someone to talk with.

600
00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:12,752
Let me...

601
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:16,939
Stop annoying me and
just get out of my face.

602
00:46:35,722 --> 00:46:39,199
Hey... Why did you drink so much?

603
00:46:43,627 --> 00:46:46,374
Hey... You're drunk.

604
00:46:46,472 --> 00:46:48,642
Go up to your room and sleep.

605
00:46:48,793 --> 00:46:49,750
<i>Come on, Minwoo.</i>

606
00:46:49,902 --> 00:46:52,576
Come sit here a moment.

607
00:47:10,555 --> 00:47:11,968
I apologize, Father.

608
00:47:12,119 --> 00:47:13,885
Honey!

609
00:47:15,184 --> 00:47:17,620
I might forgive a son who failed,

610
00:47:17,827 --> 00:47:20,834
but not one who
prances around looking down!

611
00:47:23,192 --> 00:47:24,455
I have no excuses.

612
00:47:24,565 --> 00:47:26,548
Honey...

613
00:47:26,948 --> 00:47:28,932
That's not what I meant.

614
00:47:29,514 --> 00:47:34,531
"Don't worry, I'll get back on my feet.
Give me another chance."

615
00:47:34,639 --> 00:47:36,671
That's what I want to hear from you!

616
00:47:36,873 --> 00:47:38,542
Honey...

617
00:47:40,884 --> 00:47:43,041
For whose sake?

618
00:47:43,238 --> 00:47:44,277
What?

619
00:47:44,441 --> 00:47:47,022
For whose sake should I do that?

620
00:47:47,136 --> 00:47:48,044
<i>Minwoo!</i>

621
00:47:48,132 --> 00:47:50,630
<i>What are you saying to your father?!</i>

622
00:47:52,453 --> 00:47:54,575
I'm tired of living as your son.

623
00:47:54,754 --> 00:47:56,545
I'm not cut out for it!

624
00:47:56,697 --> 00:47:58,273
Minwoo!

625
00:47:58,794 --> 00:48:03,148
If you really couldn't take it anymore,

626
00:48:03,388 --> 00:48:06,175
you wouldn't act
this way in my presence.

627
00:48:07,539 --> 00:48:09,669
Starting tomorrow,
get back on your feet.

628
00:48:09,909 --> 00:48:12,436
And if after walking the same path
over and over you really get bored to death,

629
00:48:12,613 --> 00:48:14,429
then come die before me.

630
00:48:14,555 --> 00:48:16,573
That, I would forgive.

631
00:48:16,712 --> 00:48:18,554
Honey...

632
00:48:19,676 --> 00:48:23,044
Yes, all right.

633
00:48:24,393 --> 00:48:26,777
That's exactly what I'll do.

634
00:48:36,176 --> 00:48:38,573
You really are something.

635
00:48:38,686 --> 00:48:41,537
How could you say that to your own son?

636
00:48:41,702 --> 00:48:43,754
Because he's my son.

637
00:48:44,308 --> 00:48:46,706
If that weren't the case,

638
00:48:46,904 --> 00:48:49,316
I wouldn't waste time
saying such things.

639
00:49:04,482 --> 00:49:07,053
Honey.
Jaechun is here.

640
00:49:07,411 --> 00:49:08,200
Come on in.

641
00:49:08,339 --> 00:49:10,587
- Breakfast?
- Already ate it.

642
00:49:13,836 --> 00:49:15,493
Bring Jaechun a cup of tea.

643
00:49:15,604 --> 00:49:17,002
Yes.

644
00:49:25,858 --> 00:49:27,649
Open it.

645

For Authorized Personnel Only</i>

646
00:49:52,511 --> 00:49:57,170
<i>Just in case, I investigated
Daeryuk Construction's dealings.</i>

647
00:50:04,776 --> 00:50:07,732
You like baseball, don't you?

648
00:50:07,985 --> 00:50:11,554
The perfect time to change the course of
a game is  bottom of the ninth, two outs.

649
00:50:11,844 --> 00:50:14,102
This is all I can do for you.

650
00:50:14,266 --> 00:50:16,888
You take care of the rest.

651
00:50:27,579 --> 00:50:35,868
There must be a way to get our hands
on the subway construction again?!

652
00:50:38,246 --> 00:50:39,735
Come in.

653
00:50:45,505 --> 00:50:49,851
Here are the records for the land
we bought around the subway lot.

654
00:50:53,925 --> 00:50:58,380
With all the money we invested,
is this all you could buy?

655
00:50:58,471 --> 00:50:59,916
Go out and see for yourself.

656
00:51:00,004 --> 00:51:04,294
The kind of difference that being
close to the subway or not really makes.

657
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:09,818
If you don't believe me,
try to buy it yourself.

658
00:51:10,059 --> 00:51:11,686
<i>Wait.</i>

659
00:51:12,089 --> 00:51:15,556
How much land did Daeryuk
Construction secure there?

660
00:51:16,134 --> 00:51:19,792
About... 65 percent?!

661
00:51:52,891 --> 00:51:56,208
Right... That's it!

662
00:51:56,359 --> 00:51:58,457
This is it!

663
00:52:05,255 --> 00:52:06,672
Say what?

664
00:52:06,945 --> 00:52:08,396
Think that'll even be possible?

665
00:52:08,547 --> 00:52:11,934
That's the only way we can
get the subway contract back.

666
00:52:12,025 --> 00:52:13,240
<i>It's too dangerous.</i>

667
00:52:13,333 --> 00:52:17,559
If you end up failing,
our company will really risk collapse.

668
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:19,741
I'm confident I can succeed.

669
00:52:20,561 --> 00:52:23,399
Give me just one more chance.

670
00:52:24,875 --> 00:52:30,430
People used to say "if there's
no way, don't ever walk on it."

671
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:31,434
Chairman.

672
00:52:31,526 --> 00:52:35,526
But, if there's truly a will,

673
00:52:35,693 --> 00:52:39,285
there must be a way,
even if you create it from scratch.

674
00:52:39,657 --> 00:52:44,048
I'll believe in you one last time.

675
00:52:44,413 --> 00:52:45,801
Thank you, Chairman.

676
00:52:45,969 --> 00:52:47,639
But, Chairman!

677
00:52:47,983 --> 00:52:52,646
We must take this to the end anyway.

678
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:58,047
So, what do you want me to do?

679
00:52:58,233 --> 00:53:03,317
First, gather all
the funds at your disposal.

680
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:08,314
And then?

681
00:53:12,451 --> 00:53:31,135
Two yearning souls,
holding each other's hand.

682
00:53:12,451 --> 00:53:31,135
<i>{\a6}~ The Yearning by Park Inhee ~</i>

683
00:53:32,097 --> 00:53:39,371
A smile painted on their faces,
together walking on that path.

684
00:53:40,733 --> 00:53:42,625
Lola...

685
00:53:52,369 --> 00:53:55,175
Why is he coming so often?

686
00:54:00,606 --> 00:54:02,435
Have a seat.

687
00:54:11,635 --> 00:54:15,028
What do I owe the occasion to?

688
00:54:17,702 --> 00:54:21,070
I don't have all that
time to waste, I'm afraid.

689
00:54:22,850 --> 00:54:30,670
We will sell all the land
around the subway lot to you.

690
00:54:36,593 --> 00:54:41,747
Seems like your company
is facing quite the difficulties?!

691
00:54:44,226 --> 00:54:46,426
I can certainly
understand the situation,

692
00:54:46,628 --> 00:54:51,344
but I'm afraid I won't be able to
give you that much above market value.

693
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:57,474
Help us out, Chairman Hong.

694
00:54:58,723 --> 00:55:03,629
Think I would sell that land,
if I could avoid it?

695
00:55:05,448 --> 00:55:07,059
Fine.

696
00:55:08,349 --> 00:55:09,938
I'll raise the price by half.

697
00:55:10,064 --> 00:55:11,591
What?

698
00:55:12,246 --> 00:55:17,821
You want to give us only half more
for land whose price might skyrocket...

699
00:55:18,011 --> 00:55:21,177
right after the subway is opened?

700
00:55:22,174 --> 00:55:25,970
So you're not in as bad
a situation as I thought.

701
00:55:26,134 --> 00:55:27,267
Chairman.

702
00:55:27,385 --> 00:55:29,578
Let's not even sell it.

703
00:55:35,193 --> 00:55:39,524
Then, I'll give you
twice its market value.

704
00:55:40,117 --> 00:55:41,984
That's my last offer.

705
00:55:43,041 --> 00:55:50,539
Instead, pay us all in one shot.

706
00:55:50,855 --> 00:55:52,469
Chairman!

707
00:55:56,632 --> 00:55:58,435
Fine with me.

708
00:55:58,965 --> 00:56:03,278
I pray you will soon get
your company back on its feet.

709
00:56:10,483 --> 00:56:13,275
He's been pushed right to
the edge of a cliff,

710
00:56:13,463 --> 00:56:16,456
and look at him shaking his
behind as if nothing happened.

711
00:56:16,595 --> 00:56:19,234
This still doesn't feel right.

712
00:56:19,975 --> 00:56:22,194
The die is cast already.

713
00:56:22,422 --> 00:56:26,320
Let's see if Jo Minwoo
can run with this.

714
00:56:31,422 --> 00:56:34,273
He dug his own grave.

715
00:56:34,678 --> 00:56:37,356
Manbo Construction holds
quite a lot of land there.

716
00:56:37,437 --> 00:56:38,864
How are you going to pay for that land?

717
00:56:39,015 --> 00:56:42,559
We'll soon make our investment back,
why are you even worried?

718
00:56:44,444 --> 00:56:48,341
We can always find the money.

719
00:57:06,417 --> 00:57:10,528
Today they don't even take a bite.

720
00:57:11,298 --> 00:57:13,262
That's right.

721
00:57:13,566 --> 00:57:16,902
<i>There's no way you would
find fish in putrid waters.</i>

722
00:57:18,245 --> 00:57:22,066
This was a great
fishing spot in the past.

723
00:57:22,653 --> 00:57:25,710
Didn't you turn it
into all this yourselves?

724
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:29,634
Because the first thing you ruined
with your redevelopment plans...

725
00:57:29,749 --> 00:57:31,857
is exactly this Han River.

726
00:57:32,130 --> 00:57:36,218
And redevelopment is the
only way to save it as well.

727
00:57:36,315 --> 00:57:38,563
That's what you think.

728
00:57:38,803 --> 00:57:42,397
And how about polluting people's souls?

729
00:57:45,010 --> 00:57:49,702
I came to borrow some money.

730
00:57:53,335 --> 00:57:55,887
The more, the merrier.

731
00:57:56,562 --> 00:57:59,847
You recklessly presented that
ridiculously low bidding price,

732
00:58:00,024 --> 00:58:01,827
so I bet you have no money left
to pay for the construction.

733
00:58:02,004 --> 00:58:06,973
If we could only buy the land around
the subway, we'd solve that problem.

734
00:58:07,226 --> 00:58:09,936
So you're in the mood
for some speculation.

735
00:58:10,528 --> 00:58:15,120
It's for our business's sake,
so let's just call it investment.

736
00:58:17,667 --> 00:58:22,976
They used to say that you should only
fill your boat with the fish you need,

737
00:58:23,178 --> 00:58:28,888
and that if you go overboard,
your greed will drown you.

738
00:58:29,182 --> 00:58:33,735
That is never going to happen.

739
00:58:34,606 --> 00:58:39,810
And if you can't pay back
the interests on time?

740
00:58:41,134 --> 00:58:44,931
We can just take possession
of that subway lot.

741
00:58:47,958 --> 00:58:50,444
Must it really be that land?

742
00:58:51,907 --> 00:58:54,026
If you're really that worried
you won't be able to pay back,

743
00:58:54,152 --> 00:58:56,296
you should just give up now.

744
00:58:59,134 --> 00:59:00,748
Fine.

745
00:59:01,341 --> 00:59:05,829
Instead, I expect a generous deadline.

746
00:59:09,625 --> 00:59:13,283
I'll come visit you at home tomorrow.

747
00:59:21,075 --> 00:59:22,944
It will be all right, I hope?

748
00:59:23,083 --> 00:59:26,022
He seems nervous.

749
00:59:46,631 --> 00:59:47,948
Take a look.

750
00:59:48,107 --> 00:59:52,698
Big fish always bask in putrid waters!

751
01:00:08,444 --> 01:00:09,617
It's me, Dad.

752
01:00:09,798 --> 01:00:11,433
Would today be all right with you?

753
01:00:11,812 --> 01:00:14,173
Yes, all right.

754
01:00:17,226 --> 01:00:21,199
Not because it's my son,
but he's quite the clever fella.

755
01:00:21,565 --> 01:00:24,415
Must be something nice?

756
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:32,169
- Actually, I investigated Hong Gipyo's...
- Jaechun!

757
01:00:35,222 --> 01:00:36,975
Yes.

758
01:00:39,081 --> 01:00:43,729
When all is said and done,
I'll explain everything.

759
01:00:43,948 --> 01:00:45,706
<i>Let's get up,
there's somewhere we need to go.</i>

760
01:00:45,819 --> 01:00:47,686
Yes, Director.

761
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:04,697
Since the president has taken a keen
interest in the subway construction,

762
01:01:04,809 --> 01:01:06,840
it must proceed without obstacles.

763
01:01:06,991 --> 01:01:09,224
Certainly, Mr. Congressman.

764
01:01:09,715 --> 01:01:11,550
<i>Come on in.</i>

765
01:01:13,568 --> 01:01:15,800
Aigoo... What brings you here?

766
01:01:16,002 --> 01:01:19,584
I see you're here as well.

767
01:01:21,022 --> 01:01:25,170
It's tomorrow's headline.

768
01:01:27,933 --> 01:01:30,430
<i>{\a6}~ Speculation Behind the
Seoul Subway Construction? ~</i>

769
01:01:28,942 --> 01:01:30,607
<i>What is this?</i>

770
01:01:30,981 --> 01:01:35,690
Suspicions of speculation,
not to mention corruption?

771
01:01:35,897 --> 01:01:40,102
- If it's the subway construction...
- Daeryuk Construction is involved.

772
01:01:40,544 --> 01:01:42,839
Were you aware of this?

773
01:01:43,091 --> 01:01:49,194
I had some suspicions, but I
never imagined it could be this bad.

774
01:01:49,436 --> 01:01:50,534
Director Jo.

775
01:01:50,697 --> 01:01:52,548
Stop this headline.

776
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:55,614
If the president learns of this,
we're all as good as dead!

777
01:01:55,707 --> 01:01:58,204
I already took care of that,
considering the urgency of the matter.

778
01:01:58,318 --> 01:02:01,152
Then, this is not
going to be published?

779
01:02:01,247 --> 01:02:04,656
I might have stopped it for now,
but since the journalists know,

780
01:02:04,762 --> 01:02:07,005
the problem is from now on.

781
01:02:07,169 --> 01:02:09,710
How did you handle all this?

782
01:02:09,931 --> 01:02:13,286
You assign the construction
to this kind of people?!

783
01:02:13,387 --> 01:02:15,430
That's not going to happen.
Revoke that bid immediately.

784
01:02:15,569 --> 01:02:19,766
If we revoke the bid,

785
01:02:20,195 --> 01:02:22,818
this will only end up putting
the spotlight on this issue.

786
01:02:22,907 --> 01:02:24,294
So, what are we supposed to do?

787
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:26,909
How much longer do you think
we can stop those journalists?

788
01:02:27,007 --> 01:02:29,684
There is one way.

789
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:32,932
Forcing Daeryuk Construction to
give up the construction spontaneously.

790
01:02:33,118 --> 01:02:34,099
How?

791
01:02:34,213 --> 01:02:37,607
Chairman Hong was going to compensate
for the missing construction costs...

792
01:02:37,708 --> 01:02:39,323
via real estate speculation.

793
01:02:39,474 --> 01:02:42,198
If the price of estate doesn't go up,
he won't make money,

794
01:02:42,287 --> 01:02:44,065
so he will be forced to
give up the construction.

795
01:02:44,179 --> 01:02:48,495
A subway is going to be built there,
how do you stop prices from going up?

796
01:02:48,710 --> 01:02:51,638
So you're suggesting we
change the subway's route?

797
01:02:51,733 --> 01:02:53,454
Exactly.

798
01:02:53,818 --> 01:02:56,005
If the subway route changes,

799
01:02:56,151 --> 01:02:59,910
all the land Chairman Hong bought
will never gain any value.

800
01:03:00,074 --> 01:03:05,345
Is it possible to change the route now?

801
01:03:05,913 --> 01:03:13,519
If we don't, this will only become
a time bomb we can't predict.

802
01:03:14,086 --> 01:03:15,869
Whatever it takes,

803
01:03:15,973 --> 01:03:17,862
change that route.

804
01:03:18,071 --> 01:03:21,501
Make sure Daeryuk Construction
can't go ahead with this!

805
01:03:22,094 --> 01:03:23,381
All right.

806
01:03:23,608 --> 01:03:27,970
We will review the matter and
make those changes as soon as possible.

807
01:03:38,534 --> 01:03:40,476
How did it go?

808
01:03:40,893 --> 01:03:43,504
Probably just as we planned.

809
01:03:45,149 --> 01:03:47,546
Once that subway route is changed,

810
01:03:47,810 --> 01:03:50,562
the land we bought will
become the new subway lot.

811
01:03:50,661 --> 01:03:51,934
Are you confident?

812
01:03:52,036 --> 01:03:56,086
Because that's the only
route the subway can take.

813
01:04:06,462 --> 01:04:15,412
The river flows under
the third Han River bridge.

814
01:04:06,462 --> 01:04:15,412
<i>{\a6}~ The Third Han River Bridge by Hyeeunyi ~</i>

815
01:04:15,827 --> 01:04:24,593
Carrying your dreams and mine,
along with our hearts.

816
01:04:25,148 --> 01:04:34,158
My youth whirling around
like a blossoming flower,

817
01:04:34,419 --> 01:04:43,410
like a bird, like the wind,
like the water, flowing free.

818
01:04:43,566 --> 01:04:52,943
We met again yesterday,
and pledged to each other.

819
01:04:53,141 --> 01:04:57,549
Once the night was over,
we'd take the first train,

820
01:04:57,670 --> 01:05:03,942
And together leave for
the street of happiness.

821
01:05:13,877 --> 01:05:15,365
I'm sorry, Ma'am.

822
01:05:15,469 --> 01:05:16,838
I thought you were sleeping...

823
01:05:16,937 --> 01:05:19,035
Think this is your playground?

824
01:05:19,212 --> 01:05:21,444
What are you jumping around for?

825
01:05:21,684 --> 01:05:23,980
Still, I'm not too bad, am I?

826
01:05:24,118 --> 01:05:27,107
When it comes to dancing and singing,
I'm confident I can make it.

827
01:05:27,198 --> 01:05:29,180
Just look at yourself
in the mirror, you wench.

828
01:05:29,271 --> 01:05:31,535
A housemaid like you...

829
01:05:31,705 --> 01:05:32,524
Why?

830
01:05:32,613 --> 01:05:34,797
Who said I'll never make it as a singer?

831
01:05:34,919 --> 01:05:36,886
Shut it!
Finish here and cook me lunch.

832
01:05:36,983 --> 01:05:38,755
I'm hungry.

833
01:05:42,308 --> 01:05:44,351
She does that because she likes you.

834
01:05:44,616 --> 01:05:45,852
What?

835
01:05:46,193 --> 01:05:48,680
Before she met me,

836
01:05:48,854 --> 01:05:51,503
her dream was that of becoming a singer.

837
01:05:52,335 --> 01:05:57,326
Thanks to you, I finally get
to hear singing again here.

838
01:05:57,731 --> 01:06:00,180
I'll do it more often, then.

839
01:06:00,543 --> 01:06:02,160
Ohh... Miju.

840
01:06:03,444 --> 01:06:05,309
Don't you want to go to college?

841
01:06:05,651 --> 01:06:07,282
College?!

842
01:06:07,455 --> 01:06:10,679
Going to college was my dream...

843
01:06:10,852 --> 01:06:14,698
If you promise you'll live
with us for a long time,

844
01:06:15,027 --> 01:06:16,945
I'll send you to college.

845
01:06:17,776 --> 01:06:20,476
That, I can't promise.

846
01:06:20,627 --> 01:06:21,344
Why?

847
01:06:21,586 --> 01:06:26,794
If I meet my brothers,
I'll have to leave this place.

848
01:06:29,330 --> 01:06:30,755
Chairman, this is trouble.

849
01:06:30,919 --> 01:06:32,698
What's all the fuss?

850
01:06:32,786 --> 01:06:34,981
City Hall just announced it.

851
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:37,287
They're changing the subway route.

852
01:06:38,567 --> 01:06:40,067
What?

853
01:06:43,233 --> 01:06:44,646
Commissioner!

854
01:06:44,785 --> 01:06:46,353
Aigoo... Come on in.

855
01:06:46,469 --> 01:06:48,468
I was just about to call you.

856
01:06:48,617 --> 01:06:51,758
Why did you suddenly change that route?

857
01:06:51,959 --> 01:06:54,697
Can you just change that as you please?

858
01:06:54,798 --> 01:07:00,051
What does that have to do with
the subway construction?

859
01:07:00,183 --> 01:07:03,329
The budget will change accordingly,
why would it be otherwise?

860
01:07:03,422 --> 01:07:07,863
Neither the scope nor the budget
of this project will change.

861
01:07:08,882 --> 01:07:10,900
At least tell me the reason.

862
01:07:10,988 --> 01:07:11,871
Why did you suddenly...

863
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:16,828
Seems like real estate speculation
is too excessive in the area.

864
01:07:17,850 --> 01:07:19,658
If I can do anything to
change the assembly's position,

865
01:07:19,759 --> 01:07:21,323
I will do my best to convince them.

866
01:07:21,412 --> 01:07:25,227
- So if they can just stop this motion...
- Look, Chairman Hong.

867
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:29,080
The president himself has
his eyes on this project.

868
01:07:29,295 --> 01:07:32,975
<i>If you act with imprudence,
not only yours,</i>

869
01:07:33,189 --> 01:07:37,339
but the heads of everyone else
involved will start to roll.

870
01:07:37,642 --> 01:07:39,925
Did I make myself clear?

871
01:07:42,422 --> 01:07:45,676
If you feel you're not up to the task,

872
01:07:46,013 --> 01:07:48,356
feel free to tell us.

873
01:07:48,634 --> 01:07:50,888
If Daeryuk Construction
gives up this project,

874
01:07:50,988 --> 01:07:56,782
the next in line, Manbo Construction,
will take over in accordance with our rules.

875
01:08:06,485 --> 01:08:10,674
<i>~ Seoul Subway Route Changed ~
Escaping Excessive Speculation the Reason</i>

876
01:08:15,337 --> 01:08:17,864
They suddenly change the subway route?!

877
01:08:18,053 --> 01:08:19,907
What on earth is behind all this?

878
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:23,590
I'm sure Jo Pilyeon and
Hwang Taeseop are responsible.

879
01:08:24,308 --> 01:08:28,055
We can't let them get away with this.

880
01:08:36,271 --> 01:08:39,301
Weather is nice.
You're going back to work, right?

881
01:08:39,462 --> 01:08:40,954
I'll go fetch the car.

882
01:08:41,089 --> 01:08:43,073
Wait, young man.

883
01:08:44,541 --> 01:08:46,470
How have you been?

884
01:08:46,884 --> 01:08:51,150
Is the person you were
looking for your sister?

885
01:08:51,352 --> 01:08:52,840
Did you find her?

886
01:08:53,143 --> 01:08:54,883
No, not yet.

887
01:08:55,678 --> 01:08:57,751
But... Why?

888
01:08:57,850 --> 01:09:03,964
So you promised each other you would
meet here at the end of the month?

889
01:09:05,301 --> 01:09:06,393
Aigoo!

890
01:09:06,503 --> 01:09:07,739
It's her indeed!

891
01:09:07,835 --> 01:09:10,068
It's that young lady, all right.

892
01:09:10,182 --> 01:09:11,470
My sister came here?

893
01:09:11,564 --> 01:09:13,045
Aigoo... Sure she did!

894
01:09:13,136 --> 01:09:16,278
She's been looking all over for you.

895
01:09:17,035 --> 01:09:19,084
Do you know where she is?

896
01:09:19,174 --> 01:09:23,779
Aigoo... If I knew this, I would
at least have asked her phone number.

897
01:09:23,869 --> 01:09:25,899
Aigoo... What now?!

898
01:09:28,521 --> 01:09:30,453
Miju...

899
01:09:31,853 --> 01:09:33,833
Miju!

~ On The Next Episode Of ~

906
01:09:49,836 --> 01:09:53,400
<i>Jeongyeon refused your proposal.</i>

907
01:09:53,557 --> 01:09:56,604
<i>What if I really fell for her?!</i>

908
01:09:56,718 --> 01:09:59,518
I decided to recommend Director Min.

909
01:09:59,631 --> 01:10:01,347
<i>What are you trying to say?</i>

910
01:10:01,460 --> 01:10:06,329
I can't invest in a
venture that has no hope.

911
01:10:06,468 --> 01:10:08,599
Daeryuk Construction's
Hong Gipyo is behind all this!

912
01:10:08,706 --> 01:10:12,606
<i>He must carry an account
with all his dealings.</i>

913
01:10:12,714 --> 01:10:15,325
He's meeting with a
reporter from Goryeo Ilbo.

914
01:10:15,411 --> 01:10:16,809
<i>His name is Yoon Gihoon.</i>

915
01:10:16,896 --> 01:10:18,629
Jo Minwoo's father?!

916
01:10:18,724 --> 01:10:20,135
<i>Only a night inside this place,</i>

917
01:10:20,236 --> 01:10:22,709
and you'll spend the rest of
your life regretting ever coming here.

918
01:10:22,848 --> 01:10:26,026
Jo Pilyeon arrested
the committee members.

919
01:10:26,140 --> 01:10:27,979
<i>I think I'll have to get married.</i>

920
01:10:28,079 --> 01:10:29,646
I decided to think of it
as strictly business.

921
01:10:29,747 --> 01:10:31,160
Don't do it.

922
01:10:31,278 --> 01:10:33,756
If that's the kind of marriage
you're planning, don't bother!
