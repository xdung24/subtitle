- Episode 34 -

4
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:41,940
Found it?

5
00:00:56,092 --> 00:00:57,927
I found it, Dad.

6
00:00:58,582 --> 00:00:59,936
That's a relief.

7
00:01:00,067 --> 00:01:02,935
Go freshen up and eat breakfast.

8
00:01:03,066 --> 00:01:04,813
Made you some beansprout
soup to sober you up.

9
00:01:04,915 --> 00:01:07,209
- Yes, Ma'am.
- Yes.

10
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:19,610
So are you going to
let Miju have that baby?

11
00:01:20,174 --> 00:01:21,934
Minwoo has plenty of
things to do these days.

12
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:25,443
I'll take care of everything,
so don't let him in on this.

13
00:01:25,574 --> 00:01:29,316
The sole thought gives me the chills...

14
00:01:33,611 --> 00:01:39,522
All you need to do then is take
chilling measures to deal with it.

15
00:01:42,113 --> 00:01:44,279
<i>Oppa... Oppa!</i>

16
00:01:44,727 --> 00:01:46,489
Chairman Hwang Taeseop 
has disappeared!

17
00:01:46,567 --> 00:01:47,296
What?!

18
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:52,334
My mother said Madam Oh
and Jeongyeon argued all evening,

19
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:54,590
blaming each other for it.

20
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:57,424
The hell is going on here?!

21
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:01,497
There's no way he would have
done that by himself, in that state.

22
00:02:03,462 --> 00:02:05,125
Find out what happened.

23
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,295
Who might have taken him out and why.

24
00:02:07,397 --> 00:02:09,391
All right.

25
00:02:15,397 --> 00:02:19,921
Why aren't you allowing us to resume
construction for the Songpa apartments?

26
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:25,078
Seems that someone up high 
is opposing this construction.

27
00:02:25,238 --> 00:02:26,184
And who is that?

28
00:02:26,301 --> 00:02:27,466
I can't say...

29
00:02:27,597 --> 00:02:29,653
This kind of situation 
is not very common...

30
00:02:29,799 --> 00:02:32,230
in our Gangnam development campaign.

31
00:02:32,827 --> 00:02:33,919
So it must be Lee Gangmo.

32
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:37,806
I don't believe President Lee
could have that much influence.

33
00:02:38,001 --> 00:02:39,845
I know him well.

34
00:02:40,065 --> 00:02:43,877
He's the only one
who could be behind this.

35
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:46,169
He must have his connections as well.

36
00:02:46,372 --> 00:02:50,158
I was actually 
suspecting someone else...

37
00:02:50,347 --> 00:02:52,057
Who would that be?

38
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,801
Once I have clear evidence, 
I will tell you.

39
00:03:00,574 --> 00:03:03,614
How much longer will we be able
to keep the construction on hold?

40
00:03:03,731 --> 00:03:06,206
How long would you need?

41
00:03:06,351 --> 00:03:10,967
Until company stocks crash to the point 
where I can buy them on the cheap.

42
00:03:11,112 --> 00:03:12,772
<i>Then, we can wait until then.</i>

43
00:03:12,961 --> 00:03:16,659
Because of the Olympics and Asian Games, 
it can't be stopped indefinitely.

44
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:21,309
But I'll make sure they'll keep them 
on hold as long as you need.

45
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,333
Thank you, Dad.

46
00:03:24,336 --> 00:03:26,710
There soon will be 
a shareholders' meeting.

47
00:03:26,812 --> 00:03:30,496
That's when Chairman Hwang's
testament will be presented.

48
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:34,790
So are we sure Jeongshik will be
proclaimed chairman at Jeongyeon's expense?

49
00:03:34,892 --> 00:03:37,789
His mother fixed the testament 
for that very reason,

50
00:03:37,964 --> 00:03:40,381
so that's what will happen.

51
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,164
She fixed the testament?!

52
00:04:03,616 --> 00:04:05,328
When they present it at
the next shareholders' meeting,

53
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:10,205
Hwang Jeongyeon will be ousted,
and Jeongshik will take her place.

54
00:04:10,807 --> 00:04:15,971
The money we took from them is not
even half their secret fund's total.

55
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,382
They'll soon sell the rest of
the land and encash those funds.

56
00:04:21,205 --> 00:04:22,987
I'm sure they won't be
using the same account.

57
00:04:23,089 --> 00:04:25,025
They likely won't.

58
00:04:25,418 --> 00:04:27,816
I'll find what their other account is.

59
00:04:28,174 --> 00:04:32,030
They'll soon find out I took the money.

60
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:33,426
You must be careful, Hyung.

61
00:04:33,542 --> 00:04:35,086
Don't you worry.

62
00:04:35,231 --> 00:04:37,532
I'm always prepared for that.

63
00:04:42,028 --> 00:04:44,961
If we can get our hands 
on their secret fund,

64
00:04:45,325 --> 00:04:50,697
even Jo Pilyeon won't be able to 
gain control of Manbo Construction.

65
00:04:57,835 --> 00:05:00,015
What is that supposed to mean?

66
00:05:00,123 --> 00:05:02,168
Our entire deposit was withdrawn?!

67
00:05:02,277 --> 00:05:05,456
Every necessary procedure was followed.

68
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:06,987
Does that make any sense?

69
00:05:07,084 --> 00:05:08,804
We have both account book and seal,

70
00:05:08,921 --> 00:05:10,390
how could they withdraw that money?

71
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:12,937
That's what we should be 
asking you, on the contrary.

72
00:05:13,098 --> 00:05:16,504
Can I see CCTV recordings 
from that day?

73
00:05:31,235 --> 00:05:32,996
Wait.

74
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:36,825
Rewind the tape, please.

75
00:05:46,003 --> 00:05:48,158
<i>"Jo Minwoo."</i>

76
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:51,293
<i>"Take a good look."</i>

77
00:05:56,003 --> 00:05:56,898
Chief...

78
00:05:56,971 --> 00:05:59,128
Isn't... Isn't that...

79
00:05:59,217 --> 00:06:01,417
Do you know him?

80
00:06:02,773 --> 00:06:05,380
Shall I report this to the police?

81
00:06:05,971 --> 00:06:07,687
There is no need.

82
00:06:08,086 --> 00:06:10,648
Fortunately, it's one of our employees.

83
00:06:13,444 --> 00:06:15,278
And how could that be possible?

84
00:06:15,467 --> 00:06:18,314
I can't explain it myself.

85
00:06:18,764 --> 00:06:21,310
To get that money, 
they not only needed book and seal,

86
00:06:21,397 --> 00:06:23,800
but also the account password.

87
00:06:26,551 --> 00:06:31,429
You said you lost your
account book that night, right?

88
00:06:31,705 --> 00:06:34,163
I dropped it in the car.

89
00:06:36,144 --> 00:06:37,701
Now that I think about it,

90
00:06:37,967 --> 00:06:40,089
it was the same day Lee Gangmo 
withdrew that money.

91
00:06:40,235 --> 00:06:43,525
And you must have found
your account book right after.

92
00:06:43,641 --> 00:06:45,486
That's right, Dad.

93
00:06:46,688 --> 00:06:48,164
Then...

94
00:06:49,489 --> 00:06:52,205
Are you suggesting
there's a traitor among us?

95
00:06:53,173 --> 00:06:56,987
The only people who knew of
that account were you and me,

96
00:06:57,062 --> 00:06:59,609
Seongmo Hyung, Jaechun Hyung...

97
00:06:59,745 --> 00:07:01,958
and Chief Moon.

98
00:07:02,475 --> 00:07:04,232
It couldn't have been Chief Moon.

99
00:07:04,326 --> 00:07:08,633
He wouldn't have gone this far 
just to steal some money.

100
00:07:08,689 --> 00:07:10,024
Also,

101
00:07:11,183 --> 00:07:13,284
there's no way 
Seongmo Hyung would do this.

102
00:07:13,453 --> 00:07:17,424
Even more so for 
what concerns Jaechun.

103
00:07:20,862 --> 00:07:23,252
We'll have to get 
our hands on Lee Gangmo.

104
00:07:23,328 --> 00:07:25,799
Lee Gangmo...

105
00:07:27,173 --> 00:07:32,433
He must have known that we
couldn't report this to the police.

106
00:07:32,969 --> 00:07:34,406
Minwoo.

107
00:07:34,801 --> 00:07:37,442
You know how you can 
force your enemy into a trap?

108
00:07:37,611 --> 00:07:41,360
Lure them to the place they would 
trust enough to never suspect it.

109
00:07:52,132 --> 00:07:53,725
What brings you here?

110
00:07:54,167 --> 00:07:55,490
Get in.

111
00:08:05,252 --> 00:08:06,964
Is anything the matter?

112
00:08:07,096 --> 00:08:11,258
There is something you
must do for me, Seongmo.

113
00:08:12,474 --> 00:08:15,799
Minwoo thinks of you like a brother,

114
00:08:15,948 --> 00:08:18,852
so I thought you'd be
better suited than Jaechun.

115
00:08:19,049 --> 00:08:20,449
Tell me.

116
00:08:21,007 --> 00:08:25,232
There's this leech of a wench 
who's been sticking to Minwoo.

117
00:08:26,018 --> 00:08:29,060
I need your help to force her 
out of the picture.

118
00:08:29,201 --> 00:08:32,612
Seemed like Minwoo really likes her...

119
00:08:32,715 --> 00:08:34,933
He's just frivolously 
flirting with her.

120
00:08:35,563 --> 00:08:40,091
If you really care about Minwoo,
they need to be separated.

121
00:08:40,185 --> 00:08:41,980
Who is that woman?

122
00:08:42,895 --> 00:08:46,012
- I need to know what she looks like...
- Tomorrow,

123
00:08:46,181 --> 00:08:52,020
Chief Moon will withdraw our secret funds
to be wired to the Swiss bank account.

124
00:08:52,446 --> 00:08:58,032
When we've dealt with that,
I'll give you all the details.

125
00:08:58,211 --> 00:08:59,959
All right.

126
00:09:04,723 --> 00:09:05,691
Ahh...

127
00:09:06,189 --> 00:09:08,877
Come to my office tomorrow morning.

128
00:09:09,281 --> 00:09:12,131
We'll finish talking about that woman.

129
00:09:12,259 --> 00:09:13,500
All right.

130
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,718
Let's go.

131
00:09:22,382 --> 00:09:25,455
What did Jo Pilyeon come
all the way here for?

132
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:30,366
What's wrong?

133
00:09:30,497 --> 00:09:34,256
Just felt like his only purpose for 
coming here was letting me in on that.

134
00:09:35,478 --> 00:09:40,022
Even someone like Jo Pilyeon 
wouldn't suspect you.

135
00:09:45,525 --> 00:09:46,935
Tomorrow?

136
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:51,327
That will make our plans
a lot easier than I thought.

137
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:53,366
I'm feeling a bit nervous about this.

138
00:09:53,892 --> 00:09:56,279
Just feel like things are
going a little too easy.

139
00:09:56,636 --> 00:09:57,858
No need to be nervous, Hyung.

140
00:09:57,943 --> 00:10:00,386
I'm just fine,

141
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:04,469
but I fear something 
could happen to you.

142
00:10:06,136 --> 00:10:08,566
You must really be careful, Gangmo.

143
00:10:11,254 --> 00:10:13,587
Sotae and Shideok,

144
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,617
let's have a word.

145
00:10:17,271 --> 00:10:19,592
What is it now...

146
00:10:24,212 --> 00:10:26,881
Shideok, you know where Chief
Moon Seongjoong lives, right?

147
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:29,380
Keep an eye on his movements
starting early tomorrow.

148
00:10:29,484 --> 00:10:31,786
Why, all of a sudden?

149
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:37,147
Chief Moon will go withdraw the rest
of Jo Minwoo's secret fund in the morning.

150
00:10:37,288 --> 00:10:39,675
So we're going to get that from him?

151
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,686
Still, doing that in 
the middle of the day...

152
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:44,448
Chief Moon has both 
book and seal with him.

153
00:10:44,589 --> 00:10:47,878
If we can get our hands on that,
it'll be game over in a moment.

154
00:10:49,801 --> 00:10:51,355
Don't you worry.

155
00:10:51,487 --> 00:10:55,183
Even if they find out who did it,
they can't report it to the police.

156
00:11:05,637 --> 00:11:08,027
It won't take long, so wait here.

157
00:11:08,165 --> 00:11:09,912
Yes, all right.

158
00:11:16,898 --> 00:11:18,429
Come on in, Seongmo.

159
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:20,685
- Breakfast?
- Already ate it.

160
00:11:21,236 --> 00:11:23,429
Shall we get to the point?

161
00:11:24,082 --> 00:11:27,648
Didn't you say you had something
to tell me about Minwoo's girlfriend?

162
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,317
Right... I did.

163
00:11:34,555 --> 00:11:35,641
Yes?

164
00:11:35,838 --> 00:11:38,789
<i>Chief Moon just called me,
saying he'll leave now.</i>

165
00:11:40,425 --> 00:11:42,435
How long will it take?

166
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:44,634
<i>Two hours should be enough.</i>

167
00:11:44,935 --> 00:11:46,436
All right.

168
00:11:51,454 --> 00:11:54,274
Lee Gangmo will be caught today.

169
00:11:55,185 --> 00:11:56,975
What's that supposed to mean?

170
00:11:57,088 --> 00:11:58,300
Lee Gangmo will be caught?!

171
00:11:58,394 --> 00:12:02,961
If Lee Gangmo snatches that
money away from Chief Moon,

172
00:12:03,293 --> 00:12:06,522
he won't be getting
his hands on my money,

173
00:12:06,654 --> 00:12:10,887
but incriminate himself for
stealing the president's secret fund.

174
00:12:11,609 --> 00:12:14,449
<i>It will only take two hours at worst,</i>

175
00:12:14,618 --> 00:12:19,596
so I'd like you to remain inside
this room for the remainder.

176
00:12:21,857 --> 00:12:23,361
By any chance,

177
00:12:24,319 --> 00:12:29,268
are you suspecting Seongmo and me?

178
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,467
Not long ago,

179
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:41,614
Lee Gangmo seized secret funds I was 
about to transfer to a Swiss account.

180
00:12:41,734 --> 00:12:45,695
<i>The only people aware of
that money were us three,</i>

181
00:12:45,929 --> 00:12:48,855
<i>Chief Moon and Minwoo.</i>

182
00:12:49,472 --> 00:12:52,350
Of course I don't suspect you,

183
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,286
but Minwoo said this.

184
00:12:54,418 --> 00:13:00,497
That if Lee Gangmo ends up learning
of this and seizing that money as well,

185
00:13:01,165 --> 00:13:05,097
it can only mean that
there is a traitor among us.

186
00:14:00,171 --> 00:14:01,770
Find the right opportunity 
to hit his car.

187
00:14:01,826 --> 00:14:05,106
There are too many cars around.

188
00:14:05,181 --> 00:14:09,666
There's a bypath leading
to the bank's main offices.

189
00:14:53,174 --> 00:14:54,861
<i>Chanseong.</i>

190
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:57,154
<i>Look at me.</i>

191
00:14:58,242 --> 00:15:00,271
<i>Please, look!</i>

192
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,864
Tired?

193
00:16:08,127 --> 00:16:10,373
Yes... A little.

194
00:16:13,483 --> 00:16:15,480
It'll just be another hour.

195
00:16:41,032 --> 00:16:42,169
T...

196
00:16:42,282 --> 00:16:43,872
Tr...

197
00:16:45,498 --> 00:16:48,749
Tra...Trap?!

198
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:14,608
That's our chance... Do it!

199
00:17:39,296 --> 00:17:41,974
Who taught you how to drive, you...

200
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,328
It's a trap!

201
00:17:43,638 --> 00:17:45,884
Stop this right away.

202
00:18:01,049 --> 00:18:02,459
Yes?

203
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:16,570
Just now,

204
00:18:17,801 --> 00:18:20,681
I've been informed he 
successfully withdrew that money.

205
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:27,372
I may not know how Lee Gangmo 
managed to find out,

206
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:30,487
but it's now clear that
it wasn't from any of us.

207
00:18:59,269 --> 00:19:01,478
Who is... it?

208
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:05,632
Lee Miju!

209
00:19:08,977 --> 00:19:11,281
How nasty... You wanted to 
come here all by yourselves?

210
00:19:11,356 --> 00:19:14,259
She found out I was going
to meet you, so here she is.

211
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,032
- Glad you came, Miju.
- Congrats, Little Oppa.

212
00:19:17,163 --> 00:19:19,259
Heard business is 
doing great these days?

213
00:19:19,334 --> 00:19:21,401
You're really something...

214
00:19:21,505 --> 00:19:23,271
It's all thanks to Seongmo.

215
00:19:23,347 --> 00:19:25,921
So you'll save an
apartment for Miju, right?

216
00:19:25,997 --> 00:19:27,622
Will it just be an apartment?

217
00:19:27,716 --> 00:19:30,827
She's our youngest, 
we must do everything she wants.

218
00:19:30,883 --> 00:19:34,851
That's right... Miju.
Just tell us.

219
00:19:36,663 --> 00:19:40,428
Why, what did I say?

220
00:19:40,756 --> 00:19:43,945
I'm not the youngest, Junmo is.

221
00:19:44,054 --> 00:19:49,169
The nicer you are calling me that,
the sorrier for him I feel.

222
00:19:50,062 --> 00:19:51,171
<i>Miju...</i>

223
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:55,384
I hired some people to 
look for Junmo in the States.

224
00:19:56,004 --> 00:19:58,015
It might take some time,

225
00:19:58,325 --> 00:20:00,759
but we'll find him.

226
00:20:01,642 --> 00:20:04,395
When we find him,
I'll treat him ten...

227
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:07,402
No, a hundred times
better than I treat you.

228
00:20:09,234 --> 00:20:11,994
Want to sing a song on the stage?

229
00:20:13,741 --> 00:20:15,476
Over there?

230
00:20:15,899 --> 00:20:18,906
You wanted to hear her sing, right?

231
00:20:19,836 --> 00:20:21,343
Here.

232
00:20:33,993 --> 00:20:41,286
<i>{\a6}- "Creek" by Shim Subong -</i>

232
00:20:33,993 --> 00:20:41,286
What is the reason you do this?

233
00:20:41,436 --> 00:20:48,587
Sinking down the creek
in all loneliness.

234
00:20:49,057 --> 00:20:55,761
Luxuriant weeds spurting all over,

235
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:04,080
As the dregs scatter about,
moved by the spring breeze.

236
00:21:04,737 --> 00:21:15,896
It must have been a promise
from days long gone by,

237
00:21:16,084 --> 00:21:26,269
<i>Leading you there even if
your mind no longer desired to.</i>

238
00:21:26,504 --> 00:21:36,062
<i>Sitting by the creek every single day,</i>

239
00:21:38,082 --> 00:21:47,916
<i>Vacantly abandoning yourself 
in those thoughts.</i>

240
00:21:48,602 --> 00:21:59,554
It must have been a promise
from days long gone by,

241
00:22:00,221 --> 00:22:14,059
It must be asking you
not to ever forget it.

242
00:22:22,027 --> 00:22:24,623
As if she was in any condition
to stay out this late...

243
00:22:27,419 --> 00:22:31,035
It's already past ten...
Where on earth is she?

244
00:22:39,451 --> 00:22:41,820
- Why, what's wrong?
- It hurts.

245
00:22:42,141 --> 00:22:44,244
Looks like I got too
nervous while singing.

246
00:22:44,303 --> 00:22:45,501
I'm getting cramps.

247
00:22:45,606 --> 00:22:47,949
- On my back.
- Get on my back.

248
00:22:50,912 --> 00:22:53,800
So who are you going to choose?

249
00:22:53,964 --> 00:22:55,209
If you don't get on my back,

250
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,522
better forget about any apartment 
when you get married, Miss!

251
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:00,718
Ahh... You really...

252
00:23:00,824 --> 00:23:02,950
- Come on.
- Ahh... Right!

253
00:23:03,818 --> 00:23:05,534
Ahh... Hyung.

254
00:23:05,792 --> 00:23:09,478
Did you take your
wallet after paying?

255
00:23:12,049 --> 00:23:15,843
I remember I saw you dropping
it right as you went out?!

256
00:23:16,031 --> 00:23:20,620
Everything is in there... Ahh...

257
00:23:20,825 --> 00:23:23,421
- Go ahead first.
- Go look for it, Hyung.

258
00:23:29,277 --> 00:23:32,649
Take this, and get on my back.

259
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,041
Big Oppa!

260
00:23:37,403 --> 00:23:39,882
Hyung got fooled!

261
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:44,392
He fell for it,
hook, line and sinker!

262
00:24:03,998 --> 00:24:05,337
What's this?

263
00:24:05,431 --> 00:24:08,462
Good Lord, take a look
at the photo on his ID...

264
00:24:08,591 --> 00:24:10,332
- Ahh... Stop it...
- What kind of photo is this?

265
00:24:10,443 --> 00:24:11,923
What am I, some model?

266
00:24:12,006 --> 00:24:15,271
- Ajeosshi!
- Ahh... How embarrassing.

267
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:20,216
You call that a photo?

268
00:24:30,674 --> 00:24:32,251
Sorry, Hyung.

269
00:24:32,897 --> 00:24:35,951
I ended up putting even you at risk.

270
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:37,854
It's all right.

271
00:24:38,324 --> 00:24:40,565
As long as you're safe, I'll be fine.

272
00:24:40,952 --> 00:24:46,015
But what do you need
their secret fund for?

273
00:24:46,332 --> 00:24:50,890
Jo Minwoo will soon start
buying Manbo Construction shares.

274
00:24:51,469 --> 00:24:53,836
We're going to buy them as well.

275
00:24:53,977 --> 00:24:56,232
So you're not using that
money to build apartments,

276
00:24:56,444 --> 00:24:58,993
but just to buy 
Manbo Construction shares?

277
00:25:00,345 --> 00:25:02,317
Aren't you rushing things?

278
00:25:02,939 --> 00:25:04,419
You still aren't big enough to...

279
00:25:04,537 --> 00:25:08,653
That's what 
Chairman Hwang always did.

280
00:25:09,099 --> 00:25:11,378
When your enemy 
starts gasping for air,

281
00:25:11,777 --> 00:25:14,467
stab him without mercy.

282
00:25:16,289 --> 00:25:20,521
There isn't much time left 
for Manbo Construction.

283
00:25:21,531 --> 00:25:23,798
Before it's Jo Minwoo 
who stabs them,

284
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:26,876
I must deal with this 
with my own hands.

285
00:25:29,123 --> 00:25:32,475
Just wish they could all 
end up on the street.

286
00:25:33,741 --> 00:25:37,620
But what's with all
these Chinese characters?!

287
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:39,840
What does this mean?

288
00:25:39,957 --> 00:25:41,085
What...

289
00:25:41,343 --> 00:25:42,389
This one?

290
00:25:42,518 --> 00:25:44,740
How many strokes is this...

291
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,299
Get that bowling ball out of the way,
how can I see these characters...

292
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:50,353
Ehh... You dare joke about 
an elder's noggin?

293
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:54,406
If you're illiterate,
don't blame it on my head!

294
00:25:54,453 --> 00:25:56,869
The light is reflecting there, 
can't you see?

295
00:25:56,939 --> 00:26:01,438
The hell do you know,
you clueless little fool...

296
00:26:01,555 --> 00:26:02,883
Gangmo...

297
00:26:04,128 --> 00:26:06,207
Take a look.

298
00:26:08,215 --> 00:26:11,863
<i>- Manbo Construction Continues to Crash -
Project Resumption is Uncertain</i>

299
00:26:20,661 --> 00:26:23,533
What we want to hear 
is a concrete plan!

300
00:26:23,663 --> 00:26:27,562
Tell us how you're
going to deal with this mess!

301
00:26:27,668 --> 00:26:31,004
If you want any answer,
shouldn't you first keep quiet?

302
00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:37,195
First, we will form a team
to investigate those relics.

303
00:26:37,532 --> 00:26:39,494
We will use the relics'
level of preservation...

304
00:26:39,635 --> 00:26:41,632
as our possible evidence
for the works' resumption.

305
00:26:41,714 --> 00:26:43,946
We don't have any time for that, do we?

306
00:26:44,028 --> 00:26:45,296
Once the verdict is out,

307
00:26:45,379 --> 00:26:48,762
we can restart the construction
even without the ministry's approval.

308
00:26:48,879 --> 00:26:51,336
Are you just asking them 
to clamp down on you?

309
00:26:51,524 --> 00:26:55,295
The City Council is supporting
the resumption as well.

310
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,092
<i>If we collaborate with them 
behind closed doors,</i>

311
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:59,288
<i>I don't envision any
particular trouble down the line.</i>

312
00:26:59,878 --> 00:27:01,696
Once the construction restarts,
stocks will start climbing again,

313
00:27:01,837 --> 00:27:03,844
and everything will return to normal.

314
00:27:04,056 --> 00:27:08,578
So just trust me and rest assured.

315
00:27:14,557 --> 00:27:17,702
The director's plan
seems to be quite concrete.

316
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:23,645
If they manage to restart the
construction before stocks stop falling...

317
00:27:24,139 --> 00:27:26,793
That is never going to happen.

318
00:27:28,137 --> 00:27:33,086
Just think of it as Hwang Jeongyeon's 
last, desperate move.

319
00:27:39,184 --> 00:27:40,228
Mom...

320
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:43,547
What if the company goes belly-up 
even before I become chairman?

321
00:27:43,688 --> 00:27:46,413
Your father's incompetence
verdict will soon be out.

322
00:27:46,542 --> 00:27:49,584
Once we present the testament,
you'll automatically become chairman.

323
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:52,392
Ahh... I'm worried stocks
will keep crashing...

324
00:27:52,486 --> 00:27:54,295
If we sell them now,
at least we'll get some money.

325
00:27:54,389 --> 00:27:56,070
How can you say that?

326
00:27:56,176 --> 00:27:58,090
You're the chairman!
This company belongs to you!

327
00:27:58,184 --> 00:28:00,827
So what if I am?
If the company fails, it's all over.

328
00:28:00,874 --> 00:28:02,577
Just shut up.

329
00:28:03,175 --> 00:28:06,388
That's that, but how 
about finding your father?

330
00:28:06,529 --> 00:28:08,679
Ohh... You know...

331
00:28:08,824 --> 00:28:09,982
It's really strange.

332
00:28:10,123 --> 00:28:14,798
I looked into anyone remotely
suspicious both here and at the hospital,

333
00:28:14,904 --> 00:28:16,854
and there are no traces whatsoever.

334
00:28:17,148 --> 00:28:18,400
Just in case...

335
00:28:18,494 --> 00:28:20,068
Anyone in mind?

336
00:28:20,139 --> 00:28:21,572
Nah... Can't be.

337
00:28:21,642 --> 00:28:24,884
Why would that woman waste time 
with a man on the brink of death?

338
00:28:24,955 --> 00:28:26,505
Madam Yoo of the Royal Club?

339
00:28:26,646 --> 00:28:28,103
Ehh... Make some sense!

340
00:28:28,173 --> 00:28:29,970
Right?!

341
00:28:45,988 --> 00:28:48,549
You managed to reassure 
the shareholders,

342
00:28:48,901 --> 00:28:51,603
but I don't see this 
situation getting any better.

343
00:28:51,708 --> 00:28:58,408
Even Commissioner Han said that
someone is buying time on purpose.

344
00:28:58,698 --> 00:29:03,623
So that would be 
President Lee Gangmo?

345
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:12,768
Is Chairman Hwang doing well?

346
00:29:16,233 --> 00:29:17,208
Yes...

347
00:29:17,337 --> 00:29:20,414
I've heard he disappeared
from the nursing home...

348
00:29:20,591 --> 00:29:22,118
You knew?

349
00:29:22,247 --> 00:29:24,785
No need to hide it from me.

350
00:29:24,938 --> 00:29:27,005
I know you've taken him out of there.

351
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:29,632
Who says I did?

352
00:29:30,505 --> 00:29:32,890
So it wasn't you?

353
00:29:34,347 --> 00:29:37,695
I am looking into it...

354
00:29:37,824 --> 00:29:40,204
But we can't find any traces.

355
00:29:40,615 --> 00:29:42,283
Then...

356
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:45,572
Who could possibly...

357
00:30:07,101 --> 00:30:08,511
At the last elections,

358
00:30:08,593 --> 00:30:12,458
turns out that the situation forced me
to turn my back on you gentlemen.

359
00:30:12,669 --> 00:30:17,913
If you bear any ill will towards me,
please be frank and speak out.

360
00:30:18,582 --> 00:30:20,086
Ahh... Well...

361
00:30:20,227 --> 00:30:22,423
What ill will could I possibly bear?

362
00:30:22,776 --> 00:30:26,534
Seeing you act this way 
feels a little strange?!

363
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:30,085
I've learned two precious lessons
while serving my sentence.

364
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:34,710
One, that excessive greed can 
only further expose my shortcomings,

365
00:30:35,121 --> 00:30:38,269
and the other is that outcasts
are not cut out for politics.

366
00:30:38,398 --> 00:30:43,633
Is it because you want the ruling party
to recommend you for the next elections?

367
00:30:45,213 --> 00:30:47,980
Sounds like you need an ally...

368
00:30:48,132 --> 00:30:51,781
That sounds even better.

369
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:56,002
Looks like you're finally starting to 
understand what politics is all about.

370
00:30:56,120 --> 00:31:01,593
In politics, aren't friends and foes
just two sides of the same coin?

371
00:31:01,781 --> 00:31:03,062
That's right.

372
00:31:03,273 --> 00:31:04,918
If there's anything that
can be turned upside down,

373
00:31:04,976 --> 00:31:08,195
that's political rivalries.

374
00:31:08,712 --> 00:31:12,897
You should be practicing that kind
of mentality a little more often?

375
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:16,745
Things got a little overheated
between us at the last elections.

376
00:31:16,854 --> 00:31:18,750
I'll admit I was to blame.

377
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:24,141
Will you accept my apologies?

378
00:31:25,539 --> 00:31:30,983
As long as you don't turn me from 
friend to foe at the flip of a coin...

379
00:31:31,188 --> 00:31:33,109
Of course.

380
00:31:49,277 --> 00:31:50,088
How have you been?

381
00:31:50,193 --> 00:31:51,356
Come on in.

382
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:54,003
And what are you doing here?

383
00:31:54,144 --> 00:31:56,105
I invited him.

384
00:31:57,796 --> 00:32:01,720
Doesn't look like he would fit here?!

385
00:32:01,884 --> 00:32:05,925
Baekpa is one of my
company's shareholders.

386
00:32:09,162 --> 00:32:12,427
I really appreciate what
you did for me, Congressman Oh.

387
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:18,136
Nah... Nah, you should thank
Congressman Min, on the contrary.

388
00:32:18,418 --> 00:32:21,397
I've heard that Hangang
Construction is doing great.

389
00:32:21,514 --> 00:32:25,708
We have huge expectations
for your new apartments.

390
00:32:26,728 --> 00:32:29,666
Yes, I will not disappoint you.

391
00:32:29,819 --> 00:32:32,450
You really are something.

392
00:32:32,626 --> 00:32:34,986
You manage to make
this kind of connections?!

393
00:32:35,115 --> 00:32:39,450
But... How did you make
President Lee's acquaintance?

394
00:32:39,555 --> 00:32:43,772
He devoted a very large sum to me.

395
00:32:49,349 --> 00:32:54,983
Are you telling me he
invested in Hangang Construction?

396
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,292
Well...

397
00:32:56,491 --> 00:32:58,759
Wouldn't really call it investment,

398
00:32:59,052 --> 00:33:05,171
and I'd rather let him tell us 
what kind of money it really was.

399
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:20,179
Give me my money back.

400
00:33:21,073 --> 00:33:24,596
Return the money you seized from me.

401
00:33:24,795 --> 00:33:31,134
If it really is your money, and I 
seized it, then report it to the police.

402
00:33:31,228 --> 00:33:31,860
What?!

403
00:33:31,954 --> 00:33:34,010
If you can't report it,

404
00:33:34,598 --> 00:33:36,289
then it means it either isn't yours,

405
00:33:36,418 --> 00:33:38,426
or I didn't seize anything.

406
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,958
Guess it's one of the two?!

407
00:33:41,508 --> 00:33:43,683
Brilliant, I'll admit it.

408
00:33:43,818 --> 00:33:45,986
Artifice, resourcefulness,
it's all remarkable.

409
00:33:46,068 --> 00:33:48,476
I've had the perfect teacher in you.

410
00:33:49,492 --> 00:33:51,366
Back in the day,

411
00:33:52,788 --> 00:33:56,314
that was the same exact stratagem
you used to steal that gold.

412
00:33:57,967 --> 00:34:02,492
Since they were goods
you couldn't report to the police,

413
00:34:02,985 --> 00:34:06,124
you had no qualms about
killing someone for them.

414
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:15,330
Think you'd survive
an all-out war against me?

415
00:34:15,482 --> 00:34:17,362
Shall we give it a try?

416
00:34:17,879 --> 00:34:20,149
And that's because...

417
00:34:20,384 --> 00:34:23,697
tax audits or whatever else you use your
dirty connections to throw at me...

418
00:34:23,931 --> 00:34:28,195
will be powerless against me.

419
00:34:44,722 --> 00:34:46,006
<i>Yes, all right.</i>

420
00:34:46,112 --> 00:34:48,790
<i>Good night, then.</i>

421
00:34:49,812 --> 00:34:50,963
What did he say, Mom?

422
00:34:51,116 --> 00:34:55,650
Your father's testament will be
presented at this shareholders' meeting.

423
00:34:57,218 --> 00:34:59,539
Then, do we have a verdict?

424
00:34:59,668 --> 00:35:01,442
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

425
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:05,682
Why would they present my father's
testament, when he's not even dead?

426
00:35:05,846 --> 00:35:08,513
And how do you know
whether he's alive or dead?

427
00:35:08,666 --> 00:35:10,122
<i>Do you?</i>

428
00:35:10,417 --> 00:35:12,340
My father is alive.

429
00:35:12,833 --> 00:35:16,780
How could you consider him dead,
when you still have no idea?

430
00:35:17,123 --> 00:35:18,154
<i>It's a letter...</i>

431
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:19,176
A letter.

432
00:35:19,282 --> 00:35:21,913
There was a letter outside.

433
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:23,840
What's all this commotion
for a damned letter?

434
00:35:23,945 --> 00:35:25,549
It's a letter from the chairman!

435
00:35:25,666 --> 00:35:27,006
Take a look here.

436
00:35:27,099 --> 00:35:29,729
This letter came from him.

437
00:35:30,941 --> 00:35:31,775
What?!

438
00:35:31,833 --> 00:35:34,441
- Is it really from him?
- Give it here.

439
00:35:34,629 --> 00:35:36,872
It's for me.

440
00:35:37,806 --> 00:35:39,970
<i>- From Hwang Taeseop -</i>

441
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:46,533
<i>My dear Jeongyeon.</i>

442
00:35:46,944 --> 00:35:50,292
<i>I'm still not dead.</i>

443
00:35:50,478 --> 00:35:53,016
<i>I'm alive and well.</i>

444
00:35:53,497 --> 00:35:58,536
<i>But your stepmother 
changed my testament.</i>

445
00:35:58,877 --> 00:36:06,164
<i>It's all a conspiracy to give my entire
fortune and the company to Jeongshik.</i>

446
00:36:11,333 --> 00:36:13,318
<i>Don't let them 
take that away from you.</i>

447
00:36:13,494 --> 00:36:16,708
<i>Whatever it takes,
you must protect it.</i>

448
00:36:16,826 --> 00:36:20,796
<i>That's the only way for
Manbo Construction to survive.</i>

449
00:36:21,172 --> 00:36:23,333
<i>Jeongyeon...</i>

450
00:36:30,583 --> 00:36:32,192
What's all this about, Mom?

451
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:34,741
Dad wrote a letter?!

452
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:35,939
No way.

453
00:36:36,244 --> 00:36:37,748
There is no way.

454
00:36:38,077 --> 00:36:39,792
Your father is in a vegetative state.

455
00:36:39,956 --> 00:36:42,323
How can he write in that state?

456
00:36:42,916 --> 00:36:47,790
You two changed his testament?

457
00:36:48,313 --> 00:36:49,932
Let's hear it.

458
00:36:50,675 --> 00:36:52,829
Did you change that testament or not?

459
00:36:53,055 --> 00:36:57,048
Hey... You really
believe what this says?

460
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:59,012
Take a good look.

461
00:36:59,313 --> 00:37:01,239
It's Dad's handwriting.

462
00:37:01,747 --> 00:37:03,149
Speak to me!

463
00:37:03,258 --> 00:37:05,516
Did you change it or not?

464
00:37:05,852 --> 00:37:07,574
And if I did?

465
00:37:08,072 --> 00:37:08,692
What?

466
00:37:08,814 --> 00:37:10,195
Let's suppose I did.

467
00:37:10,318 --> 00:37:11,868
The hell are you going to do about it?

468
00:37:12,112 --> 00:37:13,477
Have any proof?

469
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:15,327
Any witness?

470
00:37:15,956 --> 00:37:17,657
So that's why...

471
00:37:18,109 --> 00:37:23,271
you wanted to present it
at the shareholders' meeting.

472
00:37:24,023 --> 00:37:26,250
To gain control of my seat
with that forged testament?

473
00:37:26,335 --> 00:37:28,336
Whatever you're thinking,

474
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:31,559
that testament will be presented.

475
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:35,966
No, I'm afraid it won't?!

476
00:37:36,783 --> 00:37:41,839
That letter only means
Dad is alive and well,

477
00:37:42,041 --> 00:37:44,505
so how will you present that?

478
00:37:44,862 --> 00:37:46,610
Mom...

479
00:37:53,818 --> 00:37:56,405
It will make no difference.

480
00:37:56,570 --> 00:38:00,998
Because Dad will 
show up at that meeting.

481
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:18,299
Dad...

482
00:38:33,443 --> 00:38:35,255
Ahh... Come on!

483
00:38:35,471 --> 00:38:36,295
Mom...

484
00:38:36,413 --> 00:38:37,928
What do we do now?

485
00:38:38,081 --> 00:38:41,205
There's no way 
your father has recovered.

486
00:38:42,007 --> 00:38:44,318
How can someone in his state 
recover this quickly?

487
00:38:44,436 --> 00:38:46,033
You've seen that letter!

488
00:38:46,127 --> 00:38:48,018
It's Dad's handwriting for sure!

489
00:38:48,089 --> 00:38:50,178
I said no!

490
00:38:51,195 --> 00:38:53,067
Something is wrong here.

491
00:38:53,271 --> 00:38:54,994
I'm sure.

492
00:39:08,859 --> 00:39:10,599
Hello?

493
00:39:12,711 --> 00:39:15,217
Go ahead and speak.

494
00:39:16,234 --> 00:39:17,379
Who are you?

495
00:39:17,684 --> 00:39:18,800
I said who!

496
00:39:18,917 --> 00:39:20,456
Tell me.

497
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:28,440
Is... Is it you?

498
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:30,860
If it's you, go ahead and speak!

499
00:39:30,978 --> 00:39:31,894
Speak to me!

500
00:39:31,988 --> 00:39:33,761
Do it!

501
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,238
Hello...

502
00:39:37,419 --> 00:39:38,248
Hello?

503
00:39:38,342 --> 00:39:39,223
Hello?!

504
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:41,270
Here... Give it here.

505
00:39:42,568 --> 00:39:43,549
Did you hear his voice?

506
00:39:43,667 --> 00:39:45,711
Was it really Dad?

507
00:40:11,161 --> 00:40:13,208
Stop it...

508
00:40:13,349 --> 00:40:15,616
Miju, now that you're
marrying into a good family,

509
00:40:15,698 --> 00:40:17,284
you better not start ignoring us!

510
00:40:17,378 --> 00:40:20,251
Even after the wedding,
I'll keep coming to practice.

511
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:24,198
Wait until you have a baby...
You'll soon give up your dreams of singing.

512
00:40:24,409 --> 00:40:25,631
Baby?!

513
00:40:26,688 --> 00:40:29,155
Just thinking about it scares me.

514
00:40:36,657 --> 00:40:38,088
Yes?

515
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:40,954
Father...

516
00:40:41,048 --> 00:40:42,975
What do I owe this call to?

517
00:40:43,456 --> 00:40:44,889
Right now?

518
00:40:45,383 --> 00:40:47,203
Yes, certainly, Father.

519
00:40:47,291 --> 00:40:48,729
Yes...

520
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:50,949
Your father-in-law?

521
00:40:51,078 --> 00:40:51,736
Yeah...

522
00:40:51,795 --> 00:40:52,876
He wants to meet?!

523
00:40:53,005 --> 00:40:54,790
Is he going to buy me a drink?

524
00:40:55,777 --> 00:40:57,856
I really envy you...

525
00:40:58,586 --> 00:41:00,412
Tell me about it.

526
00:41:01,469 --> 00:41:03,172
Wanna die?

527
00:41:09,499 --> 00:41:12,194
She will soon be here.

528
00:41:13,493 --> 00:41:16,159
But when Minwoo seems
to like her so much, why...

529
00:41:16,253 --> 00:41:18,920
She doesn't suit him in any way.

530
00:41:19,037 --> 00:41:22,138
So what do you 
want me to do, exactly?

531
00:41:24,717 --> 00:41:28,854
She is pregnant.

532
00:41:29,206 --> 00:41:31,355
Then, you want me to...

533
00:41:33,976 --> 00:41:37,100
You'll forgive me for
forcing this burden on you,

534
00:41:37,475 --> 00:41:41,881
but I just thought you were the
only one who could convince Minwoo.

535
00:41:43,335 --> 00:41:45,499
Take her to the hospital,

536
00:41:45,818 --> 00:41:48,788
and stay there until
the abortion is completed.

537
00:41:57,158 --> 00:41:59,319
Jo Minwoo...

538
00:42:01,057 --> 00:42:02,995
You poor fool.

539
00:42:08,533 --> 00:42:09,696
How have you been?

540
00:42:09,778 --> 00:42:12,243
Right... Come on in. Sit.

541
00:42:12,468 --> 00:42:14,099
Yes.

542
00:42:57,858 --> 00:43:02,494
I wired some money to
this account for you.

543
00:43:04,057 --> 00:43:09,554
It will be of great help when
you marry someone else later on.

544
00:43:11,245 --> 00:43:15,260
What are you... trying to say?

545
00:43:19,516 --> 00:43:23,659
Stay out of Minwoo's life.

546
00:43:24,411 --> 00:43:25,376
Father...

547
00:43:25,493 --> 00:43:29,569
I have no intention of accepting
you as my daughter-in-law.

548
00:43:31,731 --> 00:43:34,068
<i>I can't leave Minwoo.</i>

549
00:43:34,573 --> 00:43:37,997
If there is anything I am lacking,
I will give my best to improve, Father.

550
00:43:38,195 --> 00:43:41,578
- I sincerely love Min...
- And I thought you were only uneducated...

551
00:43:41,778 --> 00:43:44,327
Looks like we should
add gullible to the list.

552
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:48,873
If you really love Minwoo as you say,

553
00:43:49,378 --> 00:43:52,237
I suggest you leave him alone.

554
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:58,991
<i>After I have left, someone will help
you wrap things up on my behalf.</i>

555
00:43:59,285 --> 00:44:01,974
Follow what he tells you to do.

556
00:44:04,398 --> 00:44:08,085
Father... I beg you...

557
00:44:24,785 --> 00:44:29,343
You will have to spend the rest
of your life pretending to be dead.

558
00:44:30,491 --> 00:44:35,073
<i>Because if you ever show up 
before Minwoo or me again,</i>

559
00:44:35,625 --> 00:44:40,065
you might no longer
need to pretend that.

560
00:45:03,285 --> 00:45:04,753
Big Oppa...

561
00:45:04,906 --> 00:45:08,946
Until I tell you otherwise,
pretend you don't know me.

562
00:45:17,729 --> 00:45:19,115
Yes?

563
00:45:21,793 --> 00:45:23,740
Ohh... Hyung. Tell me.

564
00:45:30,927 --> 00:45:33,243
What did you just say?

565
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:38,985
Miju... with Jo Minwoo?!

566
00:45:39,208 --> 00:45:42,110
I'll tell you 
everything in detail later.

567
00:45:42,674 --> 00:45:46,409
Is your room empty?

568
00:46:12,908 --> 00:46:16,689
Guess Seongmo convinced her.

569
00:46:17,279 --> 00:46:18,581
Let's get going.

570
00:46:18,992 --> 00:46:20,436
Yes.

571
00:46:28,747 --> 00:46:30,563
Big Oppa...

572
00:46:35,581 --> 00:46:38,948
I did try to tell you earlier...

573
00:46:39,018 --> 00:46:41,837
How long have you 
been seeing Minwoo?

574
00:46:42,894 --> 00:46:45,898
You know him?

575
00:46:48,696 --> 00:46:51,102
You're not alone anymore.

576
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,042
Uh?!

577
00:46:52,136 --> 00:46:54,497
I said you're pregnant!

578
00:46:57,494 --> 00:47:00,802
Pre...gnant?!

579
00:47:02,294 --> 00:47:03,657
I'll have a baby?!

580
00:47:03,774 --> 00:47:10,603
Minwoo's father sent me
so that you would get an abortion.

581
00:47:24,922 --> 00:47:26,839
<i>I must talk to Minwoo!</i>

582
00:47:27,136 --> 00:47:28,551
<i>Please...</i>

583
00:47:28,622 --> 00:47:29,902
<i>It's no use, Miju.</i>

584
00:47:29,996 --> 00:47:31,500
I know his father better than anyone!

585
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:34,049
I can't leave Minwoo, I just can't!

586
00:47:34,119 --> 00:47:35,866
You must, Miju!

587
00:47:36,007 --> 00:47:39,390
Then, how about my baby?

588
00:47:42,456 --> 00:47:48,289
My baby...
What about my poor baby?

589
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:54,798
Give that baby up.

590
00:47:55,497 --> 00:47:57,837
Give what up?

591
00:47:58,212 --> 00:48:00,177
What's wrong with you?

592
00:48:00,274 --> 00:48:01,728
Please, Miju...

593
00:48:01,846 --> 00:48:02,915
I trust Minwoo.

594
00:48:02,985 --> 00:48:05,452
He will solve everything...
He's more than capable of that!

595
00:48:05,499 --> 00:48:08,553
It's nothing that Minwoo can solve!

596
00:48:09,293 --> 00:48:11,513
Minwoo really loves me.

597
00:48:11,658 --> 00:48:13,756
He can't live without me.

598
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:15,855
If he learns I'm pregnant, Father...

599
00:48:15,937 --> 00:48:18,063
<i>Don't ever call him that!</i>

600
00:48:18,204 --> 00:48:20,353
Little Oppa...

601
00:48:22,491 --> 00:48:24,136
Never,

602
00:48:24,911 --> 00:48:27,334
ever call that bastard "Father" again.

603
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,096
Gangmo Oppa...

604
00:48:29,284 --> 00:48:30,623
We...

605
00:48:31,997 --> 00:48:36,437
will never accept
you and Minwoo being together.

606
00:48:36,555 --> 00:48:38,047
What's wrong with you two?

607
00:48:38,176 --> 00:48:39,902
Why can't we be together?

608
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:42,078
Because our father!

609
00:48:45,872 --> 00:48:48,303
Was killed by Jo Pilyeon.

610
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:50,982
What?

611
00:48:55,841 --> 00:48:58,719
What did you just say?

612
00:48:59,615 --> 00:49:02,349
Are you telling me...

613
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:06,897
that Minwoo's father...

614
00:49:07,014 --> 00:49:08,987
Back in Busan,

615
00:49:10,021 --> 00:49:17,445
those people who tried to kill us all 
were sent by Jo Pilyeon.

616
00:49:19,724 --> 00:49:24,653
And you know all too well...

617
00:49:25,733 --> 00:49:27,806
how Mom died because of them.

618
00:49:28,350 --> 00:49:30,878
<i>But you still want to...</i>

619
00:49:31,266 --> 00:49:32,429
- Miju!
- Miju.

620
00:49:32,558 --> 00:49:33,472
<i>- Miju!
- Miju.</i>

621
00:49:33,589 --> 00:49:35,833
<i>Miju, wake up!</i>

622
00:49:35,938 --> 00:49:37,741
Miju!

623
00:49:39,298 --> 00:49:40,989
Miju!

624
00:49:53,558 --> 00:49:55,604
I can't even reach her...

625
00:49:55,792 --> 00:49:58,599
Where is she?

626
00:50:10,571 --> 00:50:13,801
<i>Take care of Miju's apartment.</i>

627
00:50:14,095 --> 00:50:16,608
<i>The sooner, the better.</i>

628
00:50:17,470 --> 00:50:20,132
<i>All right.
Thanks, Chanseong.</i>

629
00:50:25,561 --> 00:50:26,994
Where are you going?

630
00:50:27,182 --> 00:50:29,659
I'll just kill that Jo Minwoo.

631
00:50:29,801 --> 00:50:31,418
Gangmo.

632
00:50:31,786 --> 00:50:36,591
Do you know how Miju 
and I had to grow up?

633
00:50:38,221 --> 00:50:43,197
Do you know how 
I felt after losing her?

634
00:50:43,961 --> 00:50:45,805
You don't...

635
00:50:46,005 --> 00:50:46,898
You don't know...

636
00:50:46,991 --> 00:50:48,742
Calm down, Gangmo.

637
00:50:48,918 --> 00:50:51,185
If anyone kills him, I will.

638
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:53,429
Don't get involved.

639
00:50:53,582 --> 00:50:55,649
Calm down, Gangmo.

640
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:57,869
You can't imagine...

641
00:50:58,210 --> 00:51:00,218
You can't!

642
00:51:00,528 --> 00:51:01,416
Jo Minwoo...

643
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:03,962
Jo Minwoo!

644
00:51:27,298 --> 00:51:29,664
The shareholders' meeting is
right around the corner...

645
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:32,377
You still don't know
where your father is, right?

646
00:51:32,602 --> 00:51:37,651
He sent me a letter.

647
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:40,153
Are you sure it was his handwriting?

648
00:51:40,318 --> 00:51:44,520
My stepmother tore the paper apart
so I couldn't look closely,

649
00:51:44,649 --> 00:51:46,393
but I'm sure it was his.

650
00:51:46,486 --> 00:51:48,419
What was it about?

651
00:51:51,168 --> 00:51:54,551
If he sent it to you directly,
it must have been about something.

652
00:51:54,657 --> 00:51:58,778
He says my stepmother
changed his testament.

653
00:51:59,307 --> 00:52:02,325
To oust me from the seat of chairman.

654
00:52:04,898 --> 00:52:10,513
If the chairman doesn't
show up at the meeting, then...

655
00:52:11,614 --> 00:52:14,151
The testament will be presented, I guess.

656
00:52:15,131 --> 00:52:20,106
If that letter isn't just a fake, 
I'm sure he'll show up.

657
00:52:20,623 --> 00:52:23,883
But I can't really figure out...

658
00:52:24,083 --> 00:52:26,385
why he still hasn't shown up.

659
00:52:54,899 --> 00:52:56,661
<i>You must get up!</i>

660
00:52:56,779 --> 00:53:00,338
<i>Get up, and rescue your company!</i>

661
00:53:00,385 --> 00:53:03,590
<i>If only for my daughter Jeongyeon,</i>

662
00:53:03,684 --> 00:53:07,161
<i>I must get up!</i>

663
00:54:28,787 --> 00:54:32,408
For the time being,
Miju will have to live with you.

664
00:54:32,537 --> 00:54:35,079
How about the baby?

665
00:54:35,208 --> 00:54:40,106
The longer we wait,
the harder it will be for her.

666
00:54:51,283 --> 00:54:53,013
What can I do...

667
00:54:53,189 --> 00:54:56,043
You poor baby, what now...

668
00:54:56,913 --> 00:54:58,898
<i>Baby...</i>

669
00:55:00,122 --> 00:55:02,589
Baby.

670
00:55:20,944 --> 00:55:23,423
Oppa...

671
00:56:14,883 --> 00:56:16,250
<i>Miju!</i>

672
00:56:39,892 --> 00:56:41,676
<i>Minwoo.</i>

673
00:56:42,439 --> 00:56:44,789
<i>Don't ever look for me again.</i>

674
00:56:45,364 --> 00:56:48,994
<i>We could never
go back to the way it was.</i>

675
00:56:49,934 --> 00:56:52,377
<i>You did nothing wrong.</i>

676
00:56:52,565 --> 00:56:55,241
<i>It's my fault that I need to leave you.</i>

677
00:56:55,981 --> 00:57:00,715
<i>You said you wouldn't forgive me 
if I left you a third time, right?</i>

678
00:57:00,891 --> 00:57:03,640
<i>You don't need to.</i>

679
00:57:04,356 --> 00:57:05,477
<i>I wish you happiness,</i>

680
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:07,098
<i>Minwoo.</i>

681
00:57:07,286 --> 00:57:09,824
You silly...

682
00:57:10,023 --> 00:57:12,572
Hey... Lee Miju!

683
00:57:17,362 --> 00:57:19,635
What did you do to Miju?

684
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:22,078
Which one of you did it?

685
00:57:23,335 --> 00:57:25,450
What are you talking about, suddenly?

686
00:57:25,567 --> 00:57:27,975
Miju would never
disappear out of the blue.

687
00:57:28,306 --> 00:57:30,794
Where did you send her?

688
00:57:30,935 --> 00:57:33,000
Guess she got scared.

689
00:57:33,153 --> 00:57:37,137
Afraid we'd completely
expose her, she ran away.

690
00:57:37,852 --> 00:57:39,249
What's that supposed to mean?

691
00:57:39,379 --> 00:57:43,548
From what I hear, she had
another man other than you.

692
00:57:43,701 --> 00:57:45,843
And you think I'd believe that?

693
00:57:45,937 --> 00:57:47,629
Ask Seongmo.

694
00:57:47,770 --> 00:57:49,191
He'll tell you every detail.

695
00:57:49,262 --> 00:57:53,079
Don't get Seongmo Hyung
involved in your dirty dealings!

696
00:57:59,056 --> 00:58:00,305
Yes?

697
00:58:02,455 --> 00:58:05,332
It's Seongmo.

698
00:58:05,485 --> 00:58:07,952
Get the phone.
He's asking for you.

699
00:58:10,442 --> 00:58:11,669
All right.

700
00:58:13,548 --> 00:58:15,698
See you there.

701
00:58:24,813 --> 00:58:26,992
They're dead.

702
00:58:28,025 --> 00:58:29,564
Minwoo, Jo Pilyeon...

703
00:58:29,670 --> 00:58:31,561
I'll get rid of them.

704
00:58:31,851 --> 00:58:33,922
Calm down, Seonbaenim.

705
00:58:36,612 --> 00:58:38,436
Miju...

706
00:58:39,929 --> 00:58:42,265
is the only thing I live for.

707
00:58:43,075 --> 00:58:46,294
And they took that away from me.

708
00:58:47,539 --> 00:58:51,497
I have no intention of
living in this world any longer.

709
00:58:54,352 --> 00:58:55,491
Seonbaenim!

710
00:58:55,644 --> 00:58:57,347
Seonbaenim!

711
00:59:22,355 --> 00:59:24,364
Where is Miju?

712
00:59:25,027 --> 00:59:26,866
What did you do to her...

713
00:59:32,908 --> 00:59:35,845
Do I look pathetic to you as well?

714
00:59:36,563 --> 00:59:40,402
But... 
Without Miju, I...

715
00:59:52,313 --> 00:59:55,401
Just... kill me, Hyung...

716
00:59:56,611 --> 01:00:00,796
If you're not going
to tell me where she is,

717
01:00:01,689 --> 01:00:03,920
just kill me!

718
01:00:06,619 --> 01:00:09,406
Without her,

719
01:00:13,485 --> 01:00:15,293
my life...

720
01:00:16,917 --> 01:00:20,250
will be meaningless.

721
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:25,786
I just want to die this way...

722
01:00:43,208 --> 01:00:46,673
<i>Ahh... Hyung!</i>

723
01:00:46,803 --> 01:00:48,177
What is it?

724
01:00:48,470 --> 01:00:52,807
Hyung... 
You really feel like a brother.

725
01:00:55,603 --> 01:00:58,281
If it weren't for you,

726
01:00:58,857 --> 01:01:03,869
I would have never endured my father, 
and I'd be dead by now.

727
01:01:06,265 --> 01:01:09,037
I love you, man.

728
01:01:09,390 --> 01:01:11,445
You know that?

729
01:01:18,365 --> 01:01:20,315
<i>Minwoo really loves me.</i>

730
01:01:20,433 --> 01:01:23,497
<i>He can't live without me.</i>

731
01:01:55,522 --> 01:01:57,189
I beg you...

732
01:01:57,882 --> 01:02:00,442
Tell me where Miju is.

733
01:02:02,557 --> 01:02:04,612
You know that.

734
01:02:06,750 --> 01:02:09,305
I don't know, either,

735
01:02:10,295 --> 01:02:12,712
so don't ever look for her again.

736
01:02:17,727 --> 01:02:19,360
Hyung...

737
01:02:19,853 --> 01:02:21,439
Hyung.

738
01:02:22,474 --> 01:02:24,272
Hyung!!

739
01:02:46,035 --> 01:02:48,173
Miss Lee Miju?

740
01:02:48,361 --> 01:02:50,217
<i>Come in.</i>

741
01:03:22,069 --> 01:03:24,266
<i>The anesthetic will
soon put you to sleep.</i>

742
01:03:25,334 --> 01:03:27,930
Count from ten, and you'll 
fall asleep right away.

743
01:03:28,012 --> 01:03:29,880
Wait.

744
01:03:31,113 --> 01:03:32,640
I'm not doing this.

745
01:03:32,828 --> 01:03:34,050
<i>What?</i>

746
01:03:36,411 --> 01:03:37,750
<i>Gangmo.</i>

747
01:03:40,595 --> 01:03:41,476
Miju?

748
01:03:41,593 --> 01:03:43,660
She's going through surgery.

749
01:04:07,678 --> 01:04:09,726
How is she...
Did the surgery go well?

750
01:04:09,831 --> 01:04:10,491
What?

751
01:04:10,573 --> 01:04:12,784
I'm Lee Miju's guardian.

752
01:04:13,232 --> 01:04:15,518
Ahh... Her.

753
01:04:15,730 --> 01:04:17,615
She said she couldn't do it, and left.

754
01:04:17,903 --> 01:04:19,242
What?

755
01:04:27,546 --> 01:04:29,707
Sorry...

756
01:04:29,942 --> 01:04:33,877
Big Oppa... Little Oppa...

759
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:45,153
Miju...

760
01:04:45,306 --> 01:04:46,711
Miju!

761
01:04:47,895 --> 01:04:49,116
Miju!!

Did Miju call you?

767
01:05:04,161 --> 01:05:05,606
I have no idea where she went.

768
01:05:05,723 --> 01:05:07,532
You're Miju, right? Miju!

769
01:05:07,638 --> 01:05:09,247
<i>Is that really 
Hwang Taeseop's handwriting?</i>

770
01:05:09,341 --> 01:05:11,173
Are you telling me you
won't reveal the testament?

771
01:05:11,267 --> 01:05:13,143
This could get you into trouble.

772
01:05:13,249 --> 01:05:18,158
All you need to do is to
come back once I'm chairman.

773

Here are the Manbo
Construction shares you bought.

774
01:05:21,001 --> 01:05:24,419
What did you buy all those shares 
in Hwang Taeseop's name for?

775
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:27,188
<i>Put in a good word to turn the tide.</i>

776
01:05:27,270 --> 01:05:28,844
Are you finally starting to wake up?

777
01:05:28,973 --> 01:05:30,324
Don't you get any illusion.

778
01:05:30,430 --> 01:05:34,036
It's not for you, but for Miju's sake.
