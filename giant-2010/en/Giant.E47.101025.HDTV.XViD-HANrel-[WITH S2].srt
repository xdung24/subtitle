Episode 47

4
00:00:10,332 --> 00:00:11,798
Chief Yoon.

5
00:00:11,905 --> 00:00:13,733
Don't tell me you don't know.

6
00:00:13,828 --> 00:00:17,956
Chief Lee is just a workaholic,
it's all he has eyes for.

7
00:00:18,135 --> 00:00:22,701
So what is this thing
only you are aware of?

8
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:24,246
There is no such thing.

9
00:00:24,355 --> 00:00:25,780
How many times do I have to tell you?

10
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:27,880
Hey... Yoo Chanseong!

11
00:00:27,976 --> 00:00:29,316
Think about it.

12
00:00:29,414 --> 00:00:32,356
He could have been using you.

13
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:37,105
Don't you think you're
crossing the line here?

14
00:00:37,246 --> 00:00:41,843
I mean... How can you accuse him of
being a spy after all you've gone through?

15
00:00:41,928 --> 00:00:47,633
Lee Seongmo is going through
a polygraph test as we speak.

16
00:00:47,737 --> 00:00:49,409
A polygraph test?!

17
00:00:49,521 --> 00:00:51,782
I know how close you two are.

18
00:00:51,952 --> 00:00:55,177
So hide even the smallest detail, and...

19
00:00:55,219 --> 00:00:57,082
Do as you damn please!

20
00:01:06,303 --> 00:01:10,630
Have you bugged
Yoo Chanseong's phone?

21
00:01:10,741 --> 00:01:11,946
Yes.

22
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:54,740
Yoo Chanseong just left.

23
00:01:58,163 --> 00:02:00,610
Stick to him.

24
00:02:03,108 --> 00:02:05,051
Are you ready?

25
00:02:06,212 --> 00:02:08,191
Let's begin with a little warm-up.

26
00:02:08,602 --> 00:02:11,037
Name, Lee Seongmo.

27
00:02:11,518 --> 00:02:12,734
Yes.

28
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:15,478
Working for the ANSP.

29
00:02:16,412 --> 00:02:17,840
Yes.

30
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:24,205
Do you pride yourself on having given
your very best for the sake of your country?

31
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:31,053
I suddenly get the feeling that
it all might have been in vain.

32
00:02:32,081 --> 00:02:34,222
You know Congressman Min
Honggi quite well, don't you?

33
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,362
You know that he worked here.

34
00:02:37,503 --> 00:02:42,344
I hear Congressman Min has formed a
faction of sorts among fellow party members.

35
00:02:42,768 --> 00:02:45,966
Have you heard
of his mountaineering club?

36
00:02:46,389 --> 00:02:47,011
Yes.

37
00:02:47,096 --> 00:02:49,846
You know who the members are?

38
00:02:50,067 --> 00:02:51,441
More or less.

39
00:02:51,551 --> 00:02:52,782
List them.

40
00:02:52,985 --> 00:02:55,074
Congressman Lee Gilbok.

41
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,716
Congressman Lee Changmin.

42
00:02:58,396 --> 00:03:00,432
Congressman Jang Youngcheol.

43
00:03:00,786 --> 00:03:03,049
Congressman Kang Soonhwi.

44
00:03:03,529 --> 00:03:06,189
Congressman Kwon Haeryong.

45
00:03:06,382 --> 00:03:08,777
Congressman Kim Suhwe.

46
00:03:09,584 --> 00:03:11,705
Congressman Yoo Inshik.

47
00:03:31,987 --> 00:03:32,949
It's me.

48
00:03:33,062 --> 00:03:34,292
Ahh... Chief Lee.

49
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:37,369
I'm heading to the
police station right now.

50
00:03:37,456 --> 00:03:38,557
Hello?

51
00:03:38,642 --> 00:03:39,978
Yoo Chanseong.

52
00:03:40,114 --> 00:03:42,029
That man you have there in custody...

53
00:03:42,142 --> 00:03:45,714
is the chairman of a top labor union.

54
00:03:48,189 --> 00:03:49,887
Hold him until I get there.

55
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,994
I will do the questioning.

56
00:03:52,901 --> 00:03:54,441
All right.

57
00:04:01,156 --> 00:04:02,825
Are you going to meet?

58
00:04:03,052 --> 00:04:04,862
Seems like they're trailing him.

59
00:04:05,117 --> 00:04:06,390
Or maybe he's been bugged.

60
00:04:06,503 --> 00:04:08,412
Then, you can't meet?

61
00:04:08,525 --> 00:04:11,128
Weren't you going to ask
for news of your brother?

62
00:04:11,464 --> 00:04:13,490
I'll have to head to the police station.

63
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,343
Help me out.

64
00:04:15,449 --> 00:04:17,160
How many times do I have to tell you?

65
00:04:17,231 --> 00:04:19,890
This prick here suddenly started hitting me.

66
00:04:20,014 --> 00:04:23,822
You were the first who started
bitching that I was eating too much!

67
00:04:23,929 --> 00:04:26,255
Then you could just stop stuffing
yourself like a goddamned pig.

68
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,377
Wh... What? Pig?

69
00:04:28,488 --> 00:04:30,145
You little rat, I ought to just...

70
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:32,018
Sure... Go ahead.

71
00:04:32,103 --> 00:04:34,055
Hit me? Guess you've made
enough money to cover for this?

72
00:04:34,225 --> 00:04:38,567
The hell is this, your living room?

73
00:04:40,022 --> 00:04:44,514
Mister Detective, why
don't you check his records?

74
00:04:44,619 --> 00:04:47,678
Look at this mug, will you?
There's "jailbird" written all over it.

75
00:04:47,801 --> 00:04:50,582
You son of a cunt...

76
00:05:09,908 --> 00:05:11,751
The hell is this?

77
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:15,571
What is all this list? He's even
been to the Samcheong camp?!

78
00:05:16,192 --> 00:05:17,410
See?

79
00:05:17,504 --> 00:05:19,671
Told you he was a jailbird.

80
00:05:19,756 --> 00:05:21,786
Excuse me.

81
00:05:22,205 --> 00:05:23,434
Come on in.

82
00:05:23,518 --> 00:05:27,507
I'll be questioning him,
so don't let anyone in.

83
00:05:27,819 --> 00:05:31,708
But he was the one who reported them?

84
00:05:32,443 --> 00:05:34,155
He's a suspect I had been trailing.

85
00:05:34,282 --> 00:05:36,010
Follow me.

86
00:05:38,226 --> 00:05:41,323
- What the hell?
- I'm so sorry.

87
00:05:42,554 --> 00:05:45,170
Allow me to apologize.

88
00:05:45,991 --> 00:05:47,985
Ahh... No...

89
00:05:48,169 --> 00:05:49,456
It was all my fault.

90
00:05:49,569 --> 00:05:51,995
I will press no charges.

91
00:05:52,108 --> 00:05:56,365
We'll just consider this settled and go.

92
00:05:59,929 --> 00:06:01,782
Shall we go?

93
00:06:02,942 --> 00:06:04,599
The hell is wrong with them?

94
00:06:04,679 --> 00:06:06,309
Hey!

95
00:06:08,065 --> 00:06:11,601
Right as recorded,
he entered the police station.

96
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:14,444
Keep checking on him.

97
00:06:21,484 --> 00:06:25,148
Have you ever engaged
in activities against national interest?

98
00:06:26,209 --> 00:06:27,807
Never.

99
00:06:28,019 --> 00:06:30,820
What do you think about
direct presidential elections?

100
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,606
I oppose them.

101
00:06:34,869 --> 00:06:39,653
We recently planned a wiretap mission
at Jeil Hotel's Chinese restaurant.

102
00:06:39,809 --> 00:06:42,412
They knew already, right?

103
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:46,740
Let me rephrase it.

104
00:06:47,098 --> 00:06:53,005
Did you leak details
of this mission to anyone?

105
00:06:54,802 --> 00:06:56,771
Answer!

106
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:07,718
I never did such thing.

107
00:07:18,345 --> 00:07:23,819
You were involved in missions dealing
with that secret fund, right?

108
00:07:24,167 --> 00:07:26,523
I'd like a more specific question.

109
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:28,022
We already know everything.

110
00:07:28,121 --> 00:07:30,893
Then I'm sure you're also aware
of whom that secret fund belongs to.

111
00:07:31,007 --> 00:07:33,270
Hey... Lee Seongmo!

112
00:07:34,104 --> 00:07:36,438
Let me ask you just one thing.

113
00:07:37,527 --> 00:07:41,946
Is the director aware of this?

114
00:07:42,994 --> 00:07:45,522
Or was Chief Oh behind this?

115
00:07:45,612 --> 00:07:47,531
Look... I ask the questions.

116
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,461
There are things you
can't say even at gunpoint!

117
00:07:52,273 --> 00:07:56,984
So if you really want to hear about
that, bring me the director first.

118
00:07:58,858 --> 00:08:01,602
Bear this in mind.

119
00:08:02,294 --> 00:08:08,575
The moment I reveal any
detail about this secret fund,

120
00:08:09,282 --> 00:08:12,687
anyone who ordered
you to investigate on this...

121
00:08:13,607 --> 00:08:17,128
will have to pay a
hefty price for what they did.

122
00:08:36,174 --> 00:08:38,334
A polygraph?!

123
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:43,794
Are you telling me they're
forcing a polygraph test on him?

124
00:08:44,051 --> 00:08:46,826
You don't need to worry about that.

125
00:08:47,034 --> 00:08:49,075
What's that supposed to mean?

126
00:08:51,819 --> 00:08:54,874
Is your name Lee Seongmo?

127
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,533
Yes.

128
00:09:00,023 --> 00:09:03,024
Do you have any family?

129
00:09:03,222 --> 00:09:04,976
No.

130
00:09:09,962 --> 00:09:13,872
The polygraph checks for any minute
alteration in breathing, skin responses,

131
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,592
pulse and blood pressure
occurring right as you lie.

132
00:09:19,706 --> 00:09:21,247
Any way to neutralize it?

133
00:09:21,346 --> 00:09:23,595
When forced by the situation to lie,

134
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:29,621
KGB and CIA agents reply while
thinking of times tables and the like.

135
00:09:29,748 --> 00:09:32,599
So they avoid any such alteration
by thinking of something else.

136
00:09:32,726 --> 00:09:35,074
- Is that it?
- That's right.

137
00:09:35,413 --> 00:09:38,638
Or else they stimulate a
meridian point under their feet...

138
00:09:38,751 --> 00:09:41,990
to deliberately lower their blood pressure.

139
00:09:42,188 --> 00:09:43,702
Let's give it another try, then.

140
00:09:43,956 --> 00:09:48,215
Do you want to get
revenge against Jo Pilyeon?

141
00:09:51,651 --> 00:09:53,928
I don't.

142
00:09:59,684 --> 00:10:01,254
I trained him extensively,

143
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:03,885
so most polygraph tests won't work.

144
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,251
Entrusting the account to me was a good move.

145
00:10:08,392 --> 00:10:11,900
Without any material evidence on
their hands, they can't do anything to him.

146
00:10:12,192 --> 00:10:15,450
Who is behind all this?

147
00:10:15,668 --> 00:10:19,354
It has to be Jo Pilyeon.

148
00:10:20,368 --> 00:10:24,003
I saw Go Jaechun in the
hallway of the ANSP offices.

149
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,482
Give me that account.

150
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:30,242
That's out of the question.

151
00:10:30,347 --> 00:10:33,263
If Jo Pilyeon is suspecting him,
my brother won't get out so easily.

152
00:10:33,404 --> 00:10:36,355
Not to mention that if they
even bugged your phones...

153
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:40,938
Do anything reckless and
you could get hurt as well.

154
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:47,511
The account is in a safe place,

155
00:10:47,699 --> 00:10:49,693
so don't worry.

156
00:10:51,221 --> 00:10:57,113
Should anything happen to
my brother, call me right away.

157
00:10:58,654 --> 00:11:00,451
You saw wrong.

158
00:11:00,677 --> 00:11:02,219
It wasn't Lee Seongmo.

159
00:11:02,374 --> 00:11:03,674
I'll just release him.

160
00:11:03,768 --> 00:11:05,146
Nah.

161
00:11:05,637 --> 00:11:07,334
You must get a confession out of him.

162
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,433
Even if all the allegations we
throw at him are unfounded?

163
00:11:09,504 --> 00:11:11,130
He's way too good at this.

164
00:11:11,286 --> 00:11:16,958
It almost feels as if someone
trained him on how to deceive polygraphs.

165
00:11:18,021 --> 00:11:22,530
Seongmo is an agent with years
of specialized training under his belt.

166
00:11:22,728 --> 00:11:26,028
Even if they brought him up north,
he wouldn't start talking so easily.

167
00:11:26,155 --> 00:11:28,503
You do have a point,

168
00:11:28,659 --> 00:11:29,705
but to be really honest,

169
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:33,749
this secret fund account is
way too big an issue for me to handle.

170
00:11:34,274 --> 00:11:38,305
Lee Seongmo earned the
respect of most ANSP agents.

171
00:11:38,446 --> 00:11:41,733
If people learn of this, we would
have to deal with plenty of headaches.

172
00:11:41,817 --> 00:11:45,099
What's wrong, Chief Oh?
This is a tug o' war.

173
00:11:45,226 --> 00:11:48,338
Are you already letting Lee
Seongmo gain the advantage?

174
00:11:48,847 --> 00:11:52,666
But should our guesses be wrong...

175
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:57,495
At times, intuition can beat reason.

176
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:00,705
This is like fishing.

177
00:12:01,413 --> 00:12:05,599
It's a fight requiring time and patience.

178
00:12:25,482 --> 00:12:29,308
- Manbo Construction Boiler Factory -

179
00:12:29,605 --> 00:12:34,032
Here is where Manbo Construction's
boiler factory will be built.

180
00:12:34,145 --> 00:12:41,543
Our negotiations with
subcontractors are proceeding smoothly.

181
00:12:42,911 --> 00:12:45,868
The most evident flaw of
ondol-based Korean-style boilers...

182
00:12:45,967 --> 00:12:48,399
is their inter-floor water pressure gap.

183
00:12:48,513 --> 00:12:51,912
Should water reach boiling
point between two floors,

184
00:12:51,997 --> 00:12:57,419
it would make the pipes expand, which
is one of the problems we must deal with.

185
00:12:58,566 --> 00:13:01,620
We already solved that problem.

186
00:13:03,432 --> 00:13:06,055
Because of the height of inter-floor
space in Korean apartments,

187
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:09,280
we developed a mechanism enabling
us to keep water at a uniform pressure.

188
00:13:09,506 --> 00:13:13,055
All we need to do is adding
an expansion tank to be used...

189
00:13:13,151 --> 00:13:14,427
whenever water reaches the boiling point.

190
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,970
That's impressive.

191
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:17,441
That's all good,

192
00:13:17,568 --> 00:13:19,652
but you should also research
some kind of mechanism...

193
00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:22,647
set up like a sprinkler,
activating itself in case of gas leaks.

194
00:13:22,725 --> 00:13:24,730
All right, Chairman.

195
00:13:29,854 --> 00:13:33,633
Manbo Construction already found
a building lot for their boiler factory.

196
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:34,753
What?!

197
00:13:34,851 --> 00:13:37,286
If they're already at that stage,

198
00:13:37,391 --> 00:13:38,959
doesn't it mean they're proceeding
at a much faster pace than us?

199
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,742
Like it would be that easy?!

200
00:13:40,826 --> 00:13:44,588
Even someone like Director Yang is
having trouble finding a solution.

201
00:13:44,692 --> 00:13:48,933
But if they stole our core
technology, it is more than likely.

202
00:13:49,048 --> 00:13:51,760
If only Factory Manager
Lee Seonggu was still with us...

203
00:13:51,851 --> 00:13:54,224
Why look for someone who stole
our own technology on his way out?

204
00:13:54,323 --> 00:13:55,935
I ought to just beat
that sorry-ass cunt to a pulp...

205
00:13:56,091 --> 00:13:59,160
Did Lee Seonggu join Manbo Construction?

206
00:13:59,273 --> 00:14:03,714
I think he is still unemployed
to avoid any suspicion.

207
00:14:08,535 --> 00:14:09,851
Aren't you being excessive now?

208
00:14:09,921 --> 00:14:13,259
How many times do I have to
tell you to wait until the factory is complete?

209
00:14:13,387 --> 00:14:17,406
I already spent all the money
you gave me for my son's surgery.

210
00:14:17,616 --> 00:14:21,152
If you could only help me out
with the rest of his hospital bills...

211
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,743
Hello?

212
00:14:22,838 --> 00:14:24,534
Hello?

213
00:14:45,372 --> 00:14:47,619
Where have you been?

214
00:14:47,744 --> 00:14:48,602
Why?

215
00:14:48,743 --> 00:14:52,588
Someone came earlier on, and
settled all hospital bills for this month.

216
00:14:52,694 --> 00:14:53,613
Who was that?

217
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:57,228
He just said you know him well...

218
00:15:01,152 --> 00:15:02,396
That's right.

219
00:15:02,538 --> 00:15:04,249
Now that's more like it.

220
00:15:04,376 --> 00:15:07,771
Manbo Construction
would never abandon me.

221
00:15:26,318 --> 00:15:29,698
- Cha Soojeong Earrings/Necklaces -

222
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:35,900
- Cha Soojeong -

223
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:39,961
Open it.

224
00:15:41,992 --> 00:15:46,097
Wow... Almost looks real.

225
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,094
Even if a fake, it's still pretty.

226
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,471
Don't you even know what a man
giving you a ring means?

227
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:54,045
I don't think I can accept it.

228
00:15:54,144 --> 00:15:55,049
Give me your hand.

229
00:15:55,148 --> 00:15:59,463
Are you telling me you're just going to
forsake your parents because of me?

230
00:16:00,644 --> 00:16:02,469
Minwoo...

231
00:16:04,562 --> 00:16:06,655
See? Why force it...

232
00:16:06,783 --> 00:16:08,904
That's a real diamond.

233
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:10,644
What?!

234
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:13,553
Why are you only telling me now?

235
00:16:15,529 --> 00:16:16,901
Have you lost something?

236
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,244
Stay away!

237
00:16:18,386 --> 00:16:20,819
Please, don't come here.

238
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:27,809
Hey... Is a diamond
more important than...

239
00:16:27,964 --> 00:16:30,058
I found it!

240
00:16:30,412 --> 00:16:33,891
If I lost it,
I don't know what I'd have done...

241
00:16:51,003 --> 00:16:57,269
So you chose Soojeong
as model for your new opening?

242
00:16:57,467 --> 00:16:59,008
Yes.

243
00:16:59,192 --> 00:17:03,330
Here are the conditions we can offer.

244
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,598
When will the final decision be made?

245
00:17:10,711 --> 00:17:15,704
With your consent, we'll have a board
meeting and decide by the end of the week.

246
00:17:15,817 --> 00:17:18,476
So you will give me ten percent of proceeds?

247
00:17:18,605 --> 00:17:19,395
Yes.

248
00:17:19,494 --> 00:17:21,409
When the final decision is made,

249
00:17:21,523 --> 00:17:24,388
I'd like to be paid sixty
million won upfront...

250
00:17:24,515 --> 00:17:25,626
Would that be possible?

251
00:17:25,722 --> 00:17:28,009
Yes, I'm sure there will be no problems.

252
00:17:28,135 --> 00:17:30,120
Then I will sign.

253
00:17:42,483 --> 00:17:43,741
Thank you.

254
00:17:43,848 --> 00:17:46,966
We will inform you
once the final decision is made.

255
00:17:50,368 --> 00:17:52,752
This is great, Miju.

256
00:17:52,877 --> 00:17:58,342
Only a week, and you'll be able
to pay Manbo Construction.

257
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:01,821
I'm so happy.

258
00:18:10,734 --> 00:18:13,605
These days,
you're hitting the jackpot.

259
00:18:13,789 --> 00:18:16,921
We owe all this to you.

260
00:18:17,374 --> 00:18:20,109
Excuse me, you are...

261
00:18:22,243 --> 00:18:25,075
Di... Di... Director Moon...

262
00:18:25,183 --> 00:18:28,115
I am Moon Seongjoong
of Manbo Construction.

263
00:18:28,225 --> 00:18:29,505
What brings you here?

264
00:18:29,615 --> 00:18:32,577
We have a meeting to
discuss concepts for our ad,

265
00:18:32,687 --> 00:18:35,703
and we require your presence as well.

266
00:18:35,807 --> 00:18:39,177
I've already paid part of the signing fee.

267
00:18:39,276 --> 00:18:41,643
But because the contract
hasn't been resolved yet,

268
00:18:41,756 --> 00:18:44,590
you will have to fulfill our requests.

269
00:18:44,718 --> 00:18:46,416
I will pay you the rest in a week.

270
00:18:46,529 --> 00:18:48,425
- If you could only wait...
- Soon...

271
00:18:48,637 --> 00:18:51,541
Our sale will begin,

272
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:54,840
and should we incur
any losses because of you,

273
00:18:54,949 --> 00:18:56,322
you will not only have to pay the signing fee,

274
00:18:56,421 --> 00:18:59,999
but you will also be sued for damages.

275
00:19:00,608 --> 00:19:02,451
This is all because of you.

276
00:19:02,569 --> 00:19:06,058
Why did you hear their name
wrong and caused all this?

277
00:19:06,183 --> 00:19:07,788
Soojeong, I'm sorry.

278
00:19:07,902 --> 00:19:10,645
Even if this gets me fired, I'll just...

279
00:19:10,773 --> 00:19:13,785
Nevermind, that won't be necessary.

280
00:19:14,121 --> 00:19:16,388
Can I come right now?

281
00:19:19,768 --> 00:19:24,386
If what I said sounded
intimidating, allow me to apologize.

282
00:19:25,648 --> 00:19:30,033
If meeting the chairman personally
is too much of a burden,

283
00:19:30,157 --> 00:19:34,754
he told me you won't be
forced to abide by that clause.

284
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:40,456
He sincerely wants to help you.

285
00:19:40,973 --> 00:19:45,384
As someone who's been serving
under him for years, Miss Soojeong...

286
00:19:45,586 --> 00:19:46,595
No...

287
00:19:46,694 --> 00:19:51,305
I hope you will try to
understand that, Miss Lee Miju.

288
00:20:01,047 --> 00:20:02,545
Chairman.

289
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,681
I brought Miss Cha.

290
00:20:06,826 --> 00:20:09,832
I'd like to have a word with you.

291
00:20:09,953 --> 00:20:11,809
Director Moon, have you explained everything?

292
00:20:11,925 --> 00:20:12,809
Yes.

293
00:20:12,941 --> 00:20:15,726
So I'm sure we have
nothing else to talk about.

294
00:20:23,818 --> 00:20:25,631
Let's go.

295
00:20:31,918 --> 00:20:34,805
The concept of this ad is
emphasizing the major strengths...

296
00:20:34,928 --> 00:20:37,788
of our ondol gas
boilers under development.

297
00:20:37,912 --> 00:20:41,232
After coming in, Cha Soojeong
will remove the thick coat she's wearing,

298
00:20:41,331 --> 00:20:43,541
to reveal light clothing instead.

299
00:20:43,697 --> 00:20:45,281
Then she will look at the camera and say,

300
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,841
"This is how you want
to dress at home, right?"

301
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:50,910
And with that comment,
the ad will conclude.

302
00:20:56,384 --> 00:21:00,170
Chairman, these were
the concepts we prepared.

303
00:21:00,283 --> 00:21:02,137
They all have merit.

304
00:21:02,233 --> 00:21:04,136
Miss Cha.

305
00:21:05,069 --> 00:21:07,558
Which one do you prefer?

306
00:21:12,608 --> 00:21:14,043
I apologize.

307
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:15,773
I...

308
00:21:18,842 --> 00:21:21,996
don't really know much about ads.

309
00:21:28,531 --> 00:21:34,947
This ad will only be
effective if it suits your image.

310
00:21:35,258 --> 00:21:37,931
So there's no need to make it
complicated, just speak your mind.

311
00:21:38,469 --> 00:21:43,758
I liked Mister Seo's concept the most.

312
00:21:44,098 --> 00:21:45,597
Director Moon.

313
00:21:45,726 --> 00:21:49,509
Add snow to Mister Seo's concept.

314
00:21:49,665 --> 00:21:53,229
It would be better to add traces
of snow to Miss Cha's hair and clothes.

315
00:21:53,385 --> 00:21:55,082
All right, Chairman.

316
00:21:55,426 --> 00:21:58,515
Ahh... Director Moon,
please drive Miss Cha home.

317
00:21:58,623 --> 00:21:59,254
Certainly, Chairman.

318
00:21:59,339 --> 00:22:02,184
That won't be necessary.

319
00:22:08,831 --> 00:22:10,575
Fine, then.

320
00:22:36,943 --> 00:22:39,232
Here, let's wrap this up.

321
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:41,942
Good job, everyone.

322
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,208
Director Moon.

323
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:59,045
Could you find out how Lee Miju
has been living the last four years?

324
00:22:59,341 --> 00:23:01,025
Her manager doesn't seem to know much,

325
00:23:01,153 --> 00:23:04,577
but I'll hire a pro to dig into this.

326
00:23:04,931 --> 00:23:06,251
I'll be counting on you.

327
00:23:06,348 --> 00:23:08,278
Yes, Chairman.

328
00:23:18,668 --> 00:23:19,947
Soojeong!

329
00:23:20,059 --> 00:23:21,352
How did it go?

330
00:23:21,476 --> 00:23:23,100
When is the shoot?

331
00:23:23,223 --> 00:23:24,658
This weekend.

332
00:23:24,776 --> 00:23:26,113
What now...

333
00:23:26,257 --> 00:23:29,564
We won't be able to
pay all the rest by then.

334
00:23:32,308 --> 00:23:37,078
Forget that, how about you
tell this to your brother Gangmo?

335
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,595
I don't want him
to get involved in this.

336
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:45,923
I'll just have to find
a way to delay that shoot.

337
00:23:54,674 --> 00:23:56,292
How is Lee Seongmo?

338
00:23:56,447 --> 00:23:58,866
He's just looking for you.

339
00:24:06,256 --> 00:24:07,522
Seongmo.

340
00:24:07,649 --> 00:24:08,574
Congressman.

341
00:24:08,683 --> 00:24:10,566
I just heard the news.

342
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:13,592
I asked to see you.

343
00:24:16,831 --> 00:24:19,703
I'd like to have a
word with him in private,

344
00:24:20,101 --> 00:24:23,281
don't tell me you
don't trust me either?!

345
00:24:23,423 --> 00:24:25,879
I'll take full responsibility.

346
00:24:40,737 --> 00:24:43,015
I really can't figure this out.

347
00:24:43,375 --> 00:24:47,541
Why is the ANSP trying to dig
into the secret presidential fund?

348
00:24:47,682 --> 00:24:52,915
Seems like opposition party
members have talked about its existence.

349
00:24:53,043 --> 00:24:55,094
Wasn't it a well known rumor by now?

350
00:24:55,193 --> 00:25:01,380
The problem is that they talked of
an account regarding that fund.

351
00:25:01,503 --> 00:25:02,970
An account?!

352
00:25:03,593 --> 00:25:06,181
Is there such a thing?

353
00:25:07,736 --> 00:25:13,199
Was anyone other than
me involved in the fund-raising?

354
00:25:13,468 --> 00:25:14,797
No.

355
00:25:14,997 --> 00:25:16,522
No one.

356
00:25:16,975 --> 00:25:20,073
It was just you and I.

357
00:25:20,738 --> 00:25:23,170
This has to be some kind of conspiracy.

358
00:25:23,404 --> 00:25:24,684
Is that what you think?

359
00:25:24,825 --> 00:25:28,543
Unless that wasn't the case,
how could such an account even exist?

360
00:25:29,193 --> 00:25:31,626
Were there any witnesses?

361
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:35,912
Seongmo.

362
00:25:36,275 --> 00:25:40,551
How about you
just give us that account?

363
00:25:45,372 --> 00:25:48,031
So you're suspecting me.

364
00:25:48,816 --> 00:25:52,275
Anyone could write an account.

365
00:25:52,456 --> 00:25:57,320
Not to mention the fact that for someone
who's been spending so long in this trade,

366
00:25:57,429 --> 00:25:59,322
writing one would be a habit by now.

367
00:25:59,506 --> 00:26:00,354
Congressman.

368
00:26:00,453 --> 00:26:05,531
Unless that account is found,
they won't let you get out of here.

369
00:26:05,715 --> 00:26:07,780
Am I making myself clear?

370
00:26:08,558 --> 00:26:12,844
Only if that account comes
out will all this pass us by,

371
00:26:13,028 --> 00:26:15,669
and you'll be able
to safely walk out of here.

372
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:26,815
Don't tell me that you showed
that account to someone else?!

373
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:31,581
For instance, someone like Min Honggi.

374
00:26:31,779 --> 00:26:35,244
Should this rumor reach the president,

375
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:39,940
you would be the one
most affected by this all.

376
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:53,188
It is all a complot by someone
who is trying to bring you harm.

377
00:26:53,823 --> 00:26:58,365
Should we fail to find him,

378
00:26:58,846 --> 00:27:02,510
I will take all the blame instead.

379
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,358
That would be much wiser.

380
00:27:06,895 --> 00:27:10,148
Just say I was the one
who wrote that account.

381
00:27:12,402 --> 00:27:13,925
Seongmo.

382
00:27:14,151 --> 00:27:16,372
I know what you're feeling.

383
00:27:16,869 --> 00:27:22,946
However, how could I let you sacrifice
yourself just for my sake?

384
00:27:23,214 --> 00:27:25,152
Conspiracy or not,

385
00:27:25,322 --> 00:27:27,585
the culprit will soon be caught.

386
00:27:27,987 --> 00:27:30,456
And I will be the
one who catches him.

387
00:27:38,783 --> 00:27:42,456
If you need any help,
don't hesitate to call me.

388
00:27:42,824 --> 00:27:46,303
Chief Oh gave us his consent.

389
00:28:09,017 --> 00:28:12,636
Sitting face to face like
that is not going to work.

390
00:28:12,763 --> 00:28:14,132
Change the cards.

391
00:28:14,226 --> 00:28:15,464
What's that supposed to mean?

392
00:28:15,552 --> 00:28:17,445
There's that certain
something you folks are good at.

393
00:28:17,544 --> 00:28:20,217
You want me to torture Lee Seongmo?

394
00:28:20,892 --> 00:28:23,808
If psychological coercion doesn't work,
you need to get physical.

395
00:28:23,914 --> 00:28:26,078
Don't you know in what kind
of atmosphere we work these days?

396
00:28:26,276 --> 00:28:29,261
If things go wrong,
I'll be blamed for everything.

397
00:28:29,576 --> 00:28:33,603
I'll talk to Director Kim.

398
00:28:34,536 --> 00:28:37,392
I can introduce you to a team
that can handle Lee Seongmo.

399
00:28:37,501 --> 00:28:42,802
The Seobinggo Anti-Communist
unit is perfect. They're pro's at this.

400
00:28:45,789 --> 00:28:47,490
Look, Chief Oh.

401
00:28:47,581 --> 00:28:52,306
It's not for me that you're
working, but for the president's sake.

402
00:28:52,414 --> 00:28:56,511
It's a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity for you.

403
00:29:10,479 --> 00:29:12,097
Here.

404
00:29:13,381 --> 00:29:16,991
You'll have to give
these fellas special treatment.

405
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:18,858
Is that clear?

406
00:29:19,152 --> 00:29:20,993
Don't you worry, President.

407
00:29:21,107 --> 00:29:23,398
We should be the ones treating you...

408
00:29:23,483 --> 00:29:25,471
Aigoo... Don't even say that.

409
00:29:25,568 --> 00:29:30,635
I've found myself such esteemed
new customers, so I should be the one.

410
00:29:36,944 --> 00:29:39,900
Director Yoo, what brings you here?

411
00:29:46,711 --> 00:29:52,864
So President Noh was the reason
why you refuse to deal with us again?

412
00:29:57,908 --> 00:30:03,037
It is thanks to the late Baekpa's
money that you made it this big!

413
00:30:03,146 --> 00:30:05,532
How can you end a twenty year
long partnership in a matter of...

414
00:30:05,616 --> 00:30:08,346
Why do people call it "currency"?!

415
00:30:10,648 --> 00:30:13,590
Because it can change course
depending on the tide, don't you think?

416
00:30:13,817 --> 00:30:18,018
These gentlemen are now my clients.

417
00:30:18,387 --> 00:30:21,695
Is that how you're going to fight me off?

418
00:30:21,944 --> 00:30:24,722
I'm just running a business here.

419
00:30:25,863 --> 00:30:29,273
I hear you've been hit
by some heavy taxes...

420
00:30:30,273 --> 00:30:33,375
So should you need any assistance,
I'd be more than glad to help you.

421
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:38,325
I would never ignore your pleas.

422
00:30:51,827 --> 00:30:56,140
Ohh... I guess we ruined the mood.

423
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,956
Here... Let's have a drink.

424
00:31:22,194 --> 00:31:28,323
Find anything you
can about that Noh Gapsoo.

425
00:31:28,997 --> 00:31:31,146
All right, Oppa.

426
00:31:42,755 --> 00:31:45,432
I said just lie down.

427
00:31:46,167 --> 00:31:47,976
It's just a little fatigue, I'm all right.

428
00:31:48,117 --> 00:31:49,631
Ehh Ehh... You really.

429
00:31:49,715 --> 00:31:52,502
Come here, I'll massage your shoulders.

430
00:31:52,817 --> 00:31:54,694
I said I'm all right.

431
00:31:55,316 --> 00:31:57,990
I said come here.

432
00:32:05,533 --> 00:32:14,437
I know all the hardships you're going
through because of your business.

433
00:32:16,312 --> 00:32:21,006
You've brought me back to life,

434
00:32:22,223 --> 00:32:26,593
but this is all I can do for you...

435
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:31,557
This is more than enough for me.

436
00:32:45,595 --> 00:32:47,360
Director.

437
00:32:47,703 --> 00:32:49,863
It's me.

438
00:32:52,534 --> 00:32:55,375
Director, are you sleeping?

439
00:32:55,672 --> 00:32:57,588
Co... Come on in.

440
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:04,157
Dad...

441
00:33:04,303 --> 00:33:06,163
What are you doing here so early?

442
00:33:06,262 --> 00:33:11,142
Ohh... I... well... had something
to talk about with her.

443
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,476
What brings you here?

444
00:33:17,973 --> 00:33:19,728
Have a seat.

445
00:33:30,182 --> 00:33:35,343
I will host the upcoming
Olympic Games event in Seoul.

446
00:33:36,216 --> 00:33:39,181
- Business Plan -
88 Seoul Olympics Funding Committee's
"A Night for Blue Seoul"

447
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:43,721
I thought this was a really important event?!

448
00:33:43,925 --> 00:33:45,701
So they entrusted this to you?

449
00:33:45,808 --> 00:33:46,874
Yes.

450
00:33:46,978 --> 00:33:50,440
A who's who of our
country's financial world will be there.

451
00:33:50,906 --> 00:33:53,085
Will politicians be there as well?

452
00:33:53,625 --> 00:33:55,548
I'd like to,

453
00:33:55,655 --> 00:33:58,369
but Deputy Mayor Han
Myeongseok is against it.

454
00:33:58,553 --> 00:34:02,386
Considering how delicate
the political situation is as of late...

455
00:34:02,643 --> 00:34:07,327
To establish your credit institution,
securing a clientele is paramount.

456
00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:13,122
Which is why I plan to use this
event to raise at least five billion.

457
00:34:16,291 --> 00:34:18,964
You haven't had lunch yet, right?

458
00:34:19,091 --> 00:34:22,066
There's this fine traditional
restaurant down the street...

459
00:34:22,173 --> 00:34:24,829
Let's go there.
Let's have lunch together.

460
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:28,535
I'm hungry, Dad.

461
00:34:50,317 --> 00:34:52,632
Jeong...shik...

462
00:34:53,622 --> 00:34:56,337
You must live...

463
00:34:57,133 --> 00:34:59,754
a better life than Jeongyeon.

464
00:35:00,574 --> 00:35:03,729
Don't you ever let
them look down on you,

465
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:12,187
and live a much
better life than Jeongyeon.

466
00:35:19,675 --> 00:35:21,916
You smile?!

467
00:35:22,577 --> 00:35:27,898
After causing my mother's death,
you have the courage to smile?

468
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:35,814
I will make you pay for forcing
my mother to cry on her last moments.

469
00:35:37,031 --> 00:35:42,391
Only then she will be
able to smile in the afterlife.

470
00:36:10,304 --> 00:36:13,124
Where are you taking me?

471
00:36:14,076 --> 00:36:15,590
I told you.

472
00:36:15,889 --> 00:36:18,758
Chief Oh said he wants
to have a drink with you.

473
00:36:18,857 --> 00:36:21,742
Spare me all this, Park Seonbae.

474
00:36:21,898 --> 00:36:24,401
I might not be the
sharpest knife in the drawer,

475
00:36:24,854 --> 00:36:28,857
but I can certainly
sense when things smell fishy.

476
00:36:28,942 --> 00:36:32,873
Chief Lee, why don't you quietly follow us?

477
00:36:32,984 --> 00:36:35,305
Before you force us to carry you there.

478
00:36:36,043 --> 00:36:37,653
Don't act all haughty with me, you prick!

479
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:40,432
Who said you could order me around?

480
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:43,028
Don't make a scene and cooperate.

481
00:36:58,586 --> 00:37:00,665
Don't resent us.

482
00:37:00,962 --> 00:37:03,720
We didn't want this, either.

483
00:37:10,768 --> 00:37:17,231
If they can't prove anything, then I'm
afraid I'll ignore the fact you're my colleague.

484
00:37:49,394 --> 00:37:53,402
All the top fifty corporations
in our country will be invited.

485
00:37:53,541 --> 00:37:55,922
And Hangang Construction will be top of the list.

486
00:37:56,064 --> 00:37:57,733
Can you really do that?

487
00:37:58,019 --> 00:38:00,095
We probably won't even make the Top 100?

488
00:38:00,752 --> 00:38:03,447
I'm the host, so I decide.

489
00:38:03,885 --> 00:38:08,126
You will be the first to be invited.

490
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:11,667
And I bet you'll cast aside some
very prominent people...

491
00:38:11,766 --> 00:38:14,369
and end up sitting right in front?!

492
00:38:15,086 --> 00:38:17,226
That's an honor?!

493
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:23,078
Just our being invited
there will be of great help to us.

494
00:38:25,213 --> 00:38:30,281
So now I paid it back, just a little.

495
00:38:30,814 --> 00:38:32,978
The debt I had with you.

496
00:38:35,001 --> 00:38:35,895
Gangmo.

497
00:38:36,004 --> 00:38:37,674
Gangmo.

498
00:38:39,479 --> 00:38:42,068
Hurry up and call this number.

499
00:38:43,539 --> 00:38:44,429
What is it?

500
00:38:44,538 --> 00:38:45,561
It's Chanseong.

501
00:38:45,689 --> 00:38:48,001
It seemed really urgent.

502
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,750
Can I use the phone?

503
00:39:03,094 --> 00:39:05,145
Things have taken
a turn for the worse.

504
00:39:05,413 --> 00:39:09,982
The chief was taken to
the Seobinggo underground bunker.

505
00:39:12,611 --> 00:39:14,507
Tell me what happened.

506
00:39:20,136 --> 00:39:23,785
Where is that account?
Tell me.

507
00:39:25,398 --> 00:39:29,052
If we don't do anything,
my brother could die!

508
00:39:30,381 --> 00:39:32,588
The 1st Yeongdeungpo subway line,

509
00:39:32,687 --> 00:39:35,105
safety box number 14.

510
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,944
And the key?

511
00:39:38,641 --> 00:39:39,971
All right.

512
00:39:40,185 --> 00:39:42,537
I'll call again if I need your help.

513
00:39:43,471 --> 00:39:44,900
Your brother might die?!

514
00:39:44,984 --> 00:39:45,946
What's that supposed to mean?

515
00:39:46,059 --> 00:39:48,643
There is no time.
See you later.

516
00:39:49,213 --> 00:39:50,882
Gangmo!

517
00:40:37,892 --> 00:40:41,296
Are you going to save
your brother with those?

518
00:40:41,834 --> 00:40:43,276
Gangmo...

519
00:40:43,432 --> 00:40:47,423
If we were dealing with gangsters,
we could have helped you.

520
00:40:47,549 --> 00:40:50,281
But I don't think this is going to work.

521
00:40:51,247 --> 00:40:55,642
I mean... I'm not saying we
should ignore your brother's situation.

522
00:40:56,213 --> 00:40:58,315
Still, there are things you just can't do...

523
00:40:58,428 --> 00:41:02,028
You just worry about the company.

524
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:04,069
I'll handle this.

525
00:41:04,164 --> 00:41:07,110
How can you say that?
We're in this together.

526
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:11,013
Why don't we
give this to some politician?

527
00:41:11,141 --> 00:41:14,687
- Wouldn't they handle it...
- Then, my brother will die!

528
00:41:47,543 --> 00:41:49,620
So how about it...

529
00:41:50,235 --> 00:41:55,393
Do we finally remember
where that account has gone?

530
00:41:56,471 --> 00:41:59,619
Aren't you a pro yourself?

531
00:42:00,058 --> 00:42:04,074
So let's not waste
each other's time, shall we?

532
00:42:04,243 --> 00:42:10,919
You will give up before I do.

533
00:42:13,227 --> 00:42:16,195
And I will remember...

534
00:42:16,565 --> 00:42:19,604
all your faces.

535
00:42:53,176 --> 00:42:54,891
Let me help you.

536
00:42:55,172 --> 00:42:57,536
Just tell me what I can do.

537
00:42:58,017 --> 00:43:00,478
Have you been listening?

538
00:43:00,702 --> 00:43:02,130
I told you it's dangerous.

539
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:05,160
But you're still planning to do it.

540
00:43:05,471 --> 00:43:08,191
- Jeongyeon...
- If we're dealing with Jo Pilyeon,

541
00:43:08,309 --> 00:43:09,774
then I just can't ignore this.

542
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:14,098
You're mistaken.
This is not Jo Pilyeon's doing.

543
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:16,672
What's that supposed to mean?

544
00:43:18,341 --> 00:43:21,283
Wasn't that money connected to him?

545
00:43:22,661 --> 00:43:24,750
That secret fund...

546
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:29,220
belongs to the most
powerful man in this country.

547
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:34,920
And a complicated web
of political connections is behind it.

548
00:43:35,174 --> 00:43:39,703
Not to mention the fact that
anyone involved with it might die.

549
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:44,031
- So, all the more reason why...
- Knowing it could kill you,

550
00:43:45,559 --> 00:43:48,190
you still came to my rescue.

551
00:43:49,519 --> 00:43:52,207
When they were holding me hostage,

552
00:43:53,205 --> 00:43:56,061
you put your life on the
line and still came there.

553
00:43:56,401 --> 00:43:59,909
If whom you're dealing
with is as scary as you say,

554
00:44:00,262 --> 00:44:03,020
then I don't want
you to fight by yourself.

555
00:44:04,237 --> 00:44:06,556
I'll never allow that.

556
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:08,734
You still can't.

557
00:44:09,173 --> 00:44:11,688
Not this time.

558
00:44:23,018 --> 00:44:25,253
- 88 Seoul Olympics Support Committee -

559
00:44:36,384 --> 00:44:40,003
Didn't we agree we
wouldn't invite politicians?

560
00:44:40,194 --> 00:44:42,931
This entire event is my responsibility.

561
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:47,346
So if you entrusted it to me,
I'd like you to let me decide on my own.

562
00:44:48,412 --> 00:44:50,288
I mean,

563
00:44:50,519 --> 00:44:53,994
these days the strife between ruling
and opposition party is reaching the limit.

564
00:44:54,376 --> 00:44:57,053
Haven't you entertained the
thought that inviting them here...

565
00:44:57,219 --> 00:44:59,984
could have an adverse
effect on the entire event?

566
00:45:00,083 --> 00:45:03,237
I'll take full responsibility for that.

567
00:45:03,887 --> 00:45:07,749
Let me hear why you're
insisting to do this, then.

568
00:45:07,905 --> 00:45:11,172
You need flowers to attract butterflies.

569
00:45:11,439 --> 00:45:13,328
Without powerful politicians participating,

570
00:45:13,435 --> 00:45:17,411
a good number of businessmen
might not show up at all.

571
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:22,432
I think the pivotal point of
this event is public acceptance.

572
00:45:22,779 --> 00:45:26,548
We must increase the scope of our
funding committee as much as possible.

573
00:45:28,783 --> 00:45:32,358
There is even a singer on the list?!

574
00:45:33,405 --> 00:45:35,823
I thought we could invite Jo Yongpil.

575
00:45:36,121 --> 00:45:39,897
A top singer like him suits
this kind of event perfectly.

576
00:45:40,434 --> 00:45:44,069
About the singer to invite...

577
00:45:44,381 --> 00:45:46,675
Could you leave that decision to me?

578
00:45:46,933 --> 00:45:50,359
Do you happen to be familiar
with a certain Cha Soojeong?

579
00:45:50,563 --> 00:45:52,511
Cha... Soojeong?

580
00:45:52,672 --> 00:45:53,959
Yes...

581
00:45:54,154 --> 00:45:57,990
You know, she's one of the
hottest newcomers these days.

582
00:45:58,674 --> 00:46:02,632
I actually think someone like
her would fit our event a lot more.

583
00:46:02,844 --> 00:46:08,063
Then, you'll let me invite
politicians as well, right?

584
00:46:08,471 --> 00:46:11,387
Well... Let's give it a try.

585
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:15,503
There is a way to save my brother?!

586
00:46:15,857 --> 00:46:21,964
I will invite members of both
parties at this fund-raising event I'm hosting.

587
00:46:22,727 --> 00:46:25,195
I will have to leave concrete plans to you,

588
00:46:25,292 --> 00:46:28,003
but wouldn't that help?

589
00:46:36,929 --> 00:46:37,876
It's me.

590
00:46:38,018 --> 00:46:39,399
Go ahead.

591
00:46:39,508 --> 00:46:43,219
Was Min Honggi the politician
who was helping my brother?

592
00:46:43,330 --> 00:46:44,842
It's not him.

593
00:46:44,956 --> 00:46:47,203
It was Chairman Hwang Taeseop.

594
00:46:49,333 --> 00:46:52,334
Why would he join forces with Chairman Hwang?

595
00:46:52,533 --> 00:46:56,534
It would be better for you not to know.

596
00:47:00,616 --> 00:47:03,833
Keep informing me of any new development.

597
00:47:03,974 --> 00:47:07,257
We'll have to find another
way to get in touch.

598
00:47:18,898 --> 00:47:22,501
Many of our mountaineering club
members are becoming agitated.

599
00:47:22,657 --> 00:47:27,746
There are even rumors that the ruling party is
trying to find all sympathizers of the amendment.

600
00:47:27,837 --> 00:47:30,613
Isn't that the reason I asked to meet you?

601
00:47:30,726 --> 00:47:35,629
- Let's begin by calming them down...
- Why don't we just forget all this?

602
00:47:35,749 --> 00:47:37,370
What's wrong with
you, Congressman Park?

603
00:47:37,441 --> 00:47:40,482
In this atmosphere, I'm not going
to approve any amendment, either.

604
00:47:40,581 --> 00:47:41,387
Congressman Kang!

605
00:47:41,472 --> 00:47:43,071
The longer your tail, the easier to find you.

606
00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:47,696
How about we just
break up this club altogether...

607
00:47:49,177 --> 00:47:51,599
What did I miss?

608
00:47:51,684 --> 00:47:54,702
I... I better go.

609
00:48:00,204 --> 00:48:03,825
These days, whenever you see
groups of two-three people talking,

610
00:48:03,938 --> 00:48:07,135
they always seem to
criticize the government.

611
00:48:07,219 --> 00:48:10,646
I'm sure ruling party members
aren't joining in on the fun?!

612
00:48:10,759 --> 00:48:13,970
Forget everyone else, but if I
have any complaints, I don't hide them!

613
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,992
Need to mention it...

614
00:48:17,945 --> 00:48:23,970
Seems like Lee Seongmo is
being investigated by the ANSP.

615
00:48:24,842 --> 00:48:25,783
For what?

616
00:48:25,884 --> 00:48:31,736
Certain ruling party members
have tried approaching the opposition.

617
00:48:31,848 --> 00:48:36,299
And looks like Seongmo
found that out from someone.

618
00:48:38,324 --> 00:48:41,443
It's too late for me to help him.

619
00:48:41,952 --> 00:48:47,539
Seongmo is at the Seobinggo
bunker as we speak.

620
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:52,730
As you well know, once you enter
that place, there are only two options.

621
00:48:52,843 --> 00:48:56,244
Either you confess, or come out crippled.

622
00:48:56,605 --> 00:48:58,337
I'm betting on the former.

623
00:48:58,450 --> 00:49:00,756
As if he was some kind of patriot,

624
00:49:00,883 --> 00:49:03,203
why resist when your flesh is burning?

625
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:06,908
And why would you tell me that?

626
00:49:07,050 --> 00:49:11,593
Because I thought you could
be the one who gave him the tip.

627
00:49:11,692 --> 00:49:12,866
Hey... Jo Pilyeon!!

628
00:49:12,951 --> 00:49:19,542
{\a6}[*From Han Dynasty poem Junzi Xing]

629
00:49:12,951 --> 00:49:19,542
Don't fix your shoes in a melon field or
tidy your hat under plum trees*, they say.

630
00:49:20,568 --> 00:49:24,534
And that means you shouldn't
do anything that would arouse suspicion.

631
00:49:24,676 --> 00:49:26,826
Is that clear?

632
00:49:38,377 --> 00:49:40,250
What are you trying to say?

633
00:49:40,358 --> 00:49:43,162
You want me to give up on them?

634
00:49:43,317 --> 00:49:46,899
Just give me the account
and those signatures instead.

635
00:49:47,004 --> 00:49:48,348
And why?

636
00:49:48,457 --> 00:49:52,854
With that in my hands, I could
at least try to change their mind.

637
00:49:53,897 --> 00:49:54,914
I can't do that.

638
00:49:55,011 --> 00:49:56,272
Chairman Hwang!

639
00:49:56,389 --> 00:49:58,944
Don't you realize in
what kind of situation we are?

640
00:49:59,043 --> 00:50:04,919
Our deal was that I would give it
to you if you convinced them to cooperate.

641
00:50:05,023 --> 00:50:09,920
Lee Seongmo has been taken
to the Seobinggo underground bunker.

642
00:50:10,585 --> 00:50:12,107
What?

643
00:50:12,526 --> 00:50:15,643
Seeing how surprised you
are, I must have guessed right.

644
00:50:15,883 --> 00:50:20,141
So Lee Seongmo is the
source of that account, right?

645
00:50:20,593 --> 00:50:24,950
And he must have been the one who
informed you of what the ANSP planned.

646
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:29,197
Well... Believe whatever you want.

647
00:50:29,318 --> 00:50:35,233
If Lee Seongmo can't resist
and ends up confessing,

648
00:50:35,761 --> 00:50:39,179
you will be the first
to pay the consequences.

649
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:44,512
So hurry up and give me that account.

650
00:50:44,621 --> 00:50:47,371
It is the only way we can survive!

651
00:50:48,678 --> 00:50:53,891
By the way, weren't
you and Min Honggi close?

652
00:50:54,127 --> 00:50:56,875
I don't trust Congressman Min.

653
00:50:57,133 --> 00:51:01,192
I've seen enough over the years
to convince me not to.

654
00:51:02,047 --> 00:51:05,294
I said give me that
account, Chairman Hwang!

655
00:51:06,588 --> 00:51:08,462
It's not in my possession.

656
00:51:08,652 --> 00:51:10,004
It's not?!

657
00:51:10,301 --> 00:51:13,455
Then, who has it?

658
00:51:14,615 --> 00:51:18,383
I'll have to get going.

659
00:51:19,514 --> 00:51:21,155
Chairman Hwang!

660
00:51:39,178 --> 00:51:42,017
How did it go?
Did you find out?

661
00:51:42,765 --> 00:51:44,534
I couldn't reach him.

662
00:51:44,704 --> 00:51:49,983
Something happened to Lee
Seongmo right as Min Honggi suggested.

663
00:51:50,295 --> 00:51:52,251
If I knew this would happen,

664
00:51:52,354 --> 00:51:55,684
I would have kept that account for myself.

665
00:51:55,927 --> 00:51:59,593
If they get it from Lee Seongmo,
we're as good as dead.

666
00:51:59,702 --> 00:52:02,516
Shouldn't we run away?

667
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:05,525
If the ANSP starts looking for us...

668
00:52:08,992 --> 00:52:10,661
Who is it?

669
00:52:14,508 --> 00:52:15,527
Gangmo.

670
00:52:15,611 --> 00:52:16,993
What are you doing here?

671
00:52:17,091 --> 00:52:18,949
I had something to talk about.

672
00:52:19,039 --> 00:52:21,929
Here... Have a seat.

673
00:52:29,171 --> 00:52:30,359
Aren't you busy?

674
00:52:30,458 --> 00:52:35,049
I might have had all the time in the past,
but things have become a little complicated.

675
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:37,524
I'm sure they're not just complicated.

676
00:52:37,636 --> 00:52:39,923
Since your life is at stake.

677
00:52:40,456 --> 00:52:43,361
And perhaps not only a few lives,

678
00:52:43,471 --> 00:52:46,317
but our country's future as well.

679
00:52:46,873 --> 00:52:48,398
Gangmo, you...

680
00:52:48,521 --> 00:52:50,187
How much do you know about this?

681
00:52:50,286 --> 00:52:55,095
All I care about is one man's life.

682
00:52:55,704 --> 00:52:57,033
Lee Seongmo.

683
00:52:57,217 --> 00:53:01,291
How can you know...

684
00:53:02,196 --> 00:53:07,312
Because he's the older brother
I lost in my childhood.

685
00:53:07,962 --> 00:53:09,348
What?!

686
00:53:09,721 --> 00:53:11,640
Lee Seongmo...

687
00:53:17,877 --> 00:53:18,924
That's my son.

688
00:53:19,023 --> 00:53:23,058
So you're Daesoo's eldest?!

689
00:53:23,185 --> 00:53:26,150
- Look at him!
- Seongmo.

690
00:53:26,274 --> 00:53:28,715
This is Dad's friend,
who runs a business in Seoul.

691
00:53:28,815 --> 00:53:31,389
- That's me!
- How are you?

692
00:53:31,502 --> 00:53:36,099
Daesoo's son can only be
like a son to me.

693
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:37,980
He sure is handsome.

694
00:53:38,093 --> 00:53:41,134
Here you go.

695
00:53:44,613 --> 00:53:46,608
Go ahead and spend it.

696
00:53:47,733 --> 00:53:50,568
Quite a son you have!

697
00:53:52,790 --> 00:53:55,352
Right... That's him.

698
00:53:55,552 --> 00:53:57,658
I saw him once.

699
00:53:57,983 --> 00:54:01,929
Lee Seongmo...
was that boy?!

700
00:54:22,277 --> 00:54:23,645
Pull him out.

701
00:54:32,849 --> 00:54:35,159
The situation is critical.

702
00:54:35,365 --> 00:54:37,719
All the ruling party members
who pledged their support...

703
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:40,477
have suddenly started
hesitating and pulling out of this.

704
00:54:41,194 --> 00:54:44,409
Was Min Honggi really behind all this?

705
00:54:44,539 --> 00:54:46,686
That's indeed the case,

706
00:54:46,796 --> 00:54:51,688
but it didn't feel like
Seongmo really trusted him.

707
00:54:54,078 --> 00:55:00,145
To help out my brother, we first need
to find out what Min Honggi is all about.

708
00:55:03,469 --> 00:55:06,043
Aren't you being excessive?

709
00:55:06,249 --> 00:55:11,277
Ever since Baekpa passed away,
you practically stopped coming.

710
00:55:11,856 --> 00:55:17,351
So didn't we answer your
call and came right away?

711
00:55:17,872 --> 00:55:21,014
Let's have a drink for
good old times' sake, then.

712
00:55:21,383 --> 00:55:23,235
Is anything the matter?

713
00:55:25,866 --> 00:55:28,709
The moment Baekpa passed away,

714
00:55:28,965 --> 00:55:32,302
many core members
sided with Jo Pilyeon.

715
00:55:32,767 --> 00:55:36,460
Are you telling me the cartel
is falling into Jo Pilyeon's hands?

716
00:55:36,574 --> 00:55:37,695
Yes.

717
00:55:37,804 --> 00:55:41,310
And Jo is using their money to
find out all opposition party members...

718
00:55:41,550 --> 00:55:44,735
who approve of the constitutional amendment.

719
00:55:44,868 --> 00:55:49,154
That Jo Pilyeon is quite resourceful, all right.

720
00:55:49,519 --> 00:55:51,050
Director Yoo.

721
00:55:51,177 --> 00:55:54,634
I'd like a word in
private with Congressman Oh,

722
00:55:54,759 --> 00:55:56,725
will you leave us alone just a moment?

723
00:55:56,818 --> 00:55:58,578
Certainly, go ahead.

724
00:55:58,909 --> 00:56:01,749
When you're done
talking, come tell me.

725
00:56:10,954 --> 00:56:13,132
Congressman.

726
00:56:13,667 --> 00:56:15,992
I have something to discuss with you.

727
00:56:16,102 --> 00:56:21,395
Didn't I warn you on
more than one occasion?

728
00:56:21,502 --> 00:56:22,798
You knew already?

729
00:56:22,902 --> 00:56:25,949
Know how long I've been in congress?

730
00:56:26,057 --> 00:56:28,518
Jo Pilyeon might be suspecting you,

731
00:56:28,631 --> 00:56:33,158
but without any evidence,
there is nothing he can do.

732
00:56:33,574 --> 00:56:38,207
So break up that club as soon
as possible, and forget all this.

733
00:56:38,648 --> 00:56:45,322
But forget that... Were you aware of the existence
of an account for the secret presidential fund?

734
00:56:47,005 --> 00:56:48,869
Look, Congressman Min.

735
00:56:49,053 --> 00:56:51,443
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

736
00:56:51,881 --> 00:56:53,296
Congressman Oh!

737
00:56:53,513 --> 00:56:56,068
With that account in our hands,
there's nothing we can't do!

738
00:56:56,179 --> 00:56:58,232
Keep it up, will you?

739
00:56:59,596 --> 00:57:02,348
Change the subject, this is no fun.

740
00:57:02,659 --> 00:57:09,832
Min Honggi's obsession over that
account makes me feel a little uneasy.

741
00:57:14,962 --> 00:57:17,031
Scene 1, take 2.

742
00:57:38,095 --> 00:57:40,678
This is how you want to...

743
00:57:41,043 --> 00:57:42,686
Cut.

744
00:57:44,185 --> 00:57:45,694
I apologize.

745
00:57:45,801 --> 00:57:48,655
It's all right.
Soojeong, don't be nervous.

746
00:57:48,796 --> 00:57:51,385
Let's do it again.

747
00:57:53,515 --> 00:57:58,160
This is how you want
to dress at home, right?

748
00:57:58,443 --> 00:57:59,546
Cut.

749
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:02,805
- That's not bad?!
- I don't like her expression.

750
00:58:02,914 --> 00:58:04,695
Let's do it again.

751
00:58:07,674 --> 00:58:12,357
This is how you want
to dress at home, right?

752
00:58:12,541 --> 00:58:14,210
Miss Cha.

753
00:58:14,309 --> 00:58:17,067
You don't look comfortable at all now.

754
00:58:18,869 --> 00:58:20,235
Let's take a break.

755
00:58:20,367 --> 00:58:21,607
All right.

756
00:58:21,755 --> 00:58:23,307
Let's have a 30 minute break.

757
00:58:23,406 --> 00:58:25,839
30 minutes, everyone.

758
00:58:29,305 --> 00:58:32,525
- Why are you trembling?
- I kind of feel cold...

759
00:58:32,628 --> 00:58:35,485
Did you catch a cold or something?

760
00:58:37,174 --> 00:58:38,933
She's got fever.

761
00:58:39,056 --> 00:58:40,336
It's all right.

762
00:58:40,450 --> 00:58:43,773
All right?! How can you say that?

763
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:50,775
It's hot water.

764
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,614
At least have that.

765
00:58:57,749 --> 00:59:00,578
The shoe company hasn't called yet, right?

766
00:59:00,677 --> 00:59:04,198
They're still a few days
away from making that decision.

767
00:59:04,439 --> 00:59:07,635
All those NG's are
on purpose, isn't it?

768
00:59:07,763 --> 00:59:10,457
You're trying to delay things.

769
00:59:12,593 --> 00:59:15,705
So that's why you even caught a cold.

770
00:59:16,525 --> 00:59:20,132
I'll find someone who
can give you cold medicine.

771
00:59:20,287 --> 00:59:23,668
Or if we can't find
it, I'll go buy it myself.

772
00:59:48,476 --> 00:59:50,030
Seonhwa.

773
00:59:50,228 --> 00:59:53,665
Go find out if Minwoo's gone.

774
00:59:55,269 --> 00:59:58,571
Is there a reason
why I shouldn't be here?

775
01:00:16,233 --> 01:00:19,302
Open your eyes... Open them!

776
01:00:19,442 --> 01:00:21,786
Open those damned eyes, you prick!

777
01:00:30,269 --> 01:00:32,079
Speak.

778
01:00:32,291 --> 01:00:35,290
Where did you hide that account?

779
01:00:36,324 --> 01:00:38,812
I said speak, you bastard!

780
01:00:39,391 --> 01:00:45,186
If I do, will you let me live?

781
01:00:46,528 --> 01:00:48,993
'Course...

782
01:00:49,893 --> 01:00:52,402
So go ahead and tell us.

783
01:00:55,344 --> 01:00:57,833
That account...

784
01:01:03,453 --> 01:01:05,419
That's right.

785
01:01:05,589 --> 01:01:09,167
Where is that account?

786
01:01:17,356 --> 01:01:19,974
It's under...

787
01:01:20,257 --> 01:01:22,379
your wife's skirt.

788
01:01:34,432 --> 01:01:36,412
Get him out of here.

789
01:01:48,612 --> 01:01:51,379
Even if you have to kill him,

790
01:01:52,499 --> 01:01:54,448
you must find that account.

791
01:01:54,562 --> 01:01:56,457
All right.

800
01:02:29,070 --> 01:02:30,953
Seongmo, are you all right?

801
01:02:31,045 --> 01:02:33,855
You said it wasn't
because of my father, so why?

802
01:02:33,951 --> 01:02:36,914
There is no reason
why people stop liking someone.

803
01:02:37,019 --> 01:02:38,067
Please, take me under your wings.

804
01:02:38,152 --> 01:02:39,722
I want to defeat Hwang Jeongyeon.

805
01:02:39,835 --> 01:02:42,325
I will mercilessly trample on all of them.

806
01:02:42,396 --> 01:02:44,166
Where is Seongmo Oppa?

807
01:02:44,274 --> 01:02:46,105
What is happening to him?

808
01:02:46,194 --> 01:02:48,958
I received all the
data about Cha Soojeong.

809
01:02:49,086 --> 01:02:52,022
Isn't this President Lee Gangmo?

810
01:02:52,137 --> 01:02:55,964
