~ Episode 13 ~

5
00:00:23,776 --> 00:00:28,909
So you promised each other you would
meet here at the end of the month?

6
00:00:29,206 --> 00:00:30,822
My sister came here?

7
00:00:30,945 --> 00:00:34,171
If I knew this, I would at least 
have asked her phone number.

8
00:00:34,279 --> 00:00:36,236
Aigoo... What now?!

9
00:00:40,406 --> 00:00:44,278
<i>I'm sure Oppa is looking for me.</i>

10
00:00:44,414 --> 00:00:48,347
<i>Will it be Gangmo Oppa, 
or Seongmo Oppa?</i>

11
00:00:51,776 --> 00:00:59,126
<i>The sole thought that my family
could be in Seoul makes my heart throb.</i>

12
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,882
<i>You'll come to 31 Building 
next time, right?</i>

13
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:07,559
<i>Oppa...</i>

14
00:01:15,778 --> 00:01:18,486
Good shot... Good shot!

15
00:01:19,233 --> 00:01:22,344
Wow... You're quite good at this.

16
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,537
How long have you 
been practicing this?

17
00:01:25,768 --> 00:01:29,789
<i>It's been so long, I don't even
know if I can do this anymore.</i>

18
00:01:37,862 --> 00:01:39,924
<i>Ahh... Dammit.</i>

19
00:01:40,101 --> 00:01:44,842
I wonder why people spend
all that money to play this.

20
00:01:44,964 --> 00:01:46,502
Give it another try.

21
00:01:46,771 --> 00:01:47,627
No.

22
00:01:47,736 --> 00:01:51,243
I'll just think of this as 
a nice walk, so let's go ahead.

23
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,882
Ehh... Really...

24
00:01:56,093 --> 00:01:59,476
<i>By now, Hong Gipyo must be losing it.</i>

25
00:01:59,639 --> 00:02:01,038
I bet.

26
00:02:01,147 --> 00:02:05,243
Since all that land he bought from me
for top dollar is not worth a penny now.

27
00:02:05,352 --> 00:02:09,523
The government is planning
to move elite private schools from...

28
00:02:09,604 --> 00:02:11,329
Gangbuk to Gangnam soon.

29
00:02:11,425 --> 00:02:13,096
That's good to hear.

30
00:02:13,191 --> 00:02:17,361
There's nothing like education
to pump up estate prices.

31
00:02:17,524 --> 00:02:22,379
When that happens, we can build 
all the apartments we want,

32
00:02:22,529 --> 00:02:25,314
and there will be no problems
selling them at the new subway lot.

33
00:02:32,622 --> 00:02:35,238
Why do you keep following me around?

34
00:02:35,465 --> 00:02:39,087
That one down there is my ball.

35
00:03:06,244 --> 00:03:07,793
What do you think, Chairman Hwang?

36
00:03:07,942 --> 00:03:11,787
Seeing them sit side by side,
they sure look good together.

37
00:03:11,895 --> 00:03:13,526
Yes...

38
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:19,253
So how about we wrap things up, 
since we're here?

39
00:03:20,222 --> 00:03:23,780
I mean regarding Minwoo
and Jeongyeon's marriage.

40
00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:26,747
<i>Chairman.
That's something...</i>

41
00:03:26,856 --> 00:03:30,415
For starters, it would be
best to have an engagement,

42
00:03:30,524 --> 00:03:32,670
what are your thoughts, Jeongyeon?

43
00:03:33,485 --> 00:03:35,495
You'll pardon me, Director.

44
00:03:35,685 --> 00:03:38,280
But this is all news to me.

45
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:43,631
You didn't even mention it to her?

46
00:03:44,302 --> 00:03:47,165
I didn't get the chance, so...

47
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:52,988
I trust it's not because you 
don't want to become in-laws with me?!

48
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:01,628
The recommendation 
will soon be announced.

49
00:04:01,751 --> 00:04:06,016
Congressman Oh Byeongtak
told me to wait for good news.

50
00:04:06,518 --> 00:04:08,315
And if we manage to get them together,

51
00:04:08,451 --> 00:04:13,588
wouldn't that be the best possible
partnership between finance and politics?

52
00:04:14,483 --> 00:04:20,447
<i>Let's get together with our wives,
and make this official.</i>

53
00:04:33,505 --> 00:04:36,894
Yes, 400,000 won so far.
Anyone wishes to raise?

54
00:04:37,002 --> 00:04:39,420
- 450.
- Yes, 450,000 won to the lady over there.

55
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,210
Any other bids?

56
00:04:41,429 --> 00:04:43,808
- 550.
- Yes, 550,000 won.

57
00:04:43,904 --> 00:04:46,675
- 600.
- 600,000 won!

58
00:04:46,811 --> 00:04:50,058
- 650.
- 650,000 won.

59
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,601
- 700.
- 700,000 won!

60
00:04:52,723 --> 00:04:55,603
<i>Does anyone want to raise that?</i>

61
00:04:59,529 --> 00:05:02,612
- 800.
- Here... 800,000 won.

62
00:05:02,692 --> 00:05:05,331
<i>800... Any other bids?</i>

63
00:05:07,817 --> 00:05:09,733
For 800,000 won, going once...

64
00:05:09,841 --> 00:05:11,852
One million won.

65
00:05:15,174 --> 00:05:17,734
<i>One million won.
One million.</i>

66
00:05:17,857 --> 00:05:20,074
<i>No other bids?</i>

67
00:05:20,269 --> 00:05:27,048
Congratulations to no. 37, winning 
the Python Ruby set for a million won.

68
00:05:36,723 --> 00:05:38,958
Mrs. Jo?

69
00:05:42,704 --> 00:05:46,824
If I knew you wanted it so bad, 
I would have just let you buy it cheaper.

70
00:05:46,987 --> 00:05:50,461
A million won is 
just pocket money, anyway.

71
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:51,670
Ahh... Right,

72
00:05:51,805 --> 00:05:54,018
which college did you graduate from?

73
00:05:56,509 --> 00:05:57,892
And why are you asking that?

74
00:05:58,014 --> 00:06:01,166
We have a membership slot 
available at our club,

75
00:06:01,247 --> 00:06:03,530
but you need to be a college
graduate to be accepted.

76
00:06:03,638 --> 00:06:04,847
Forget it.

77
00:06:04,956 --> 00:06:08,491
I can't stand getting together with
women and wasting time with gossip.

78
00:06:08,844 --> 00:06:13,251
My... Think people of our status 
would bother with gossip?

79
00:06:13,357 --> 00:06:18,571
We just do some charity on our
husbands' behalf, so no need to worry.

80
00:06:18,693 --> 00:06:23,413
I've been raising an orphan,
and do enough charity as it is?!

81
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,736
Then, all the better.

82
00:06:25,858 --> 00:06:28,277
Join our club, I will vouch for you.

83
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:30,753
I'll see you later, then.

84
00:06:34,415 --> 00:06:36,334
What now, Ma'am?!

85
00:06:36,457 --> 00:06:39,052
You only graduated 
from middle school, didn't you?

86
00:06:39,133 --> 00:06:41,375
Shut your mouth! You brat...

87
00:06:41,538 --> 00:06:44,757
Think she doesn't know
I didn't go to college?

88
00:06:46,034 --> 00:06:49,675
That sly old fox...
She goes straight for my weak spot?

89
00:06:55,452 --> 00:06:59,672
What do you think?
About getting engaged with Minwoo.

90
00:07:00,623 --> 00:07:02,515
I don't want to.

91
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:06,976
This is nothing but
a strategic marriage.

92
00:07:07,099 --> 00:07:10,005
I don't want to become
a mere pawn in your power games.

93
00:07:11,236 --> 00:07:15,969
Still, you didn't say it's 
because you don't like Jo Minwoo.

94
00:07:27,538 --> 00:07:30,578
Have a seat.

95
00:07:34,138 --> 00:07:38,578
I'll have to convey to you the bad news.

96
00:07:40,798 --> 00:07:43,125
Jeongyeon...

97
00:07:43,736 --> 00:07:46,453
ended up rejecting your proposal.

98
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:49,917
You don't want me as your son-in-law?

99
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,095
- It was Jeongyeon who...
- As for Jeongyeon,

100
00:07:53,289 --> 00:07:55,629
I'll make sure she changes her mind.

101
00:07:55,755 --> 00:07:57,822
Would that be enough?

102
00:07:58,531 --> 00:08:00,403
Afraid it won't be that easy.

103
00:08:00,553 --> 00:08:03,732
Jeongyeon's stubbornness is something
even I can't do a thing about.

104
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,522
Then, I will take care of that.

105
00:08:35,857 --> 00:08:38,128
I've heard the news from the chairman.

106
00:08:38,406 --> 00:08:41,612
You knew they were talking
about our marriage, weren't you?

107
00:08:41,734 --> 00:08:44,505
I was the first 
to mention it to my father.

108
00:08:44,694 --> 00:08:46,992
That I wanted to marry you.

109
00:08:48,092 --> 00:08:52,277
You said you dreamed of being
kissed by me at the hotel, right?

110
00:08:52,412 --> 00:08:56,216
Do you still think of it as just a dream?

111
00:08:56,352 --> 00:08:58,240
What?

112
00:09:05,292 --> 00:09:07,084
You didn't...

113
00:09:15,923 --> 00:09:18,324
Will you think again...

114
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:21,548
that this is just a dream, a nightmare?

115
00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:23,428
What's wrong with you?

116
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:26,200
Don't you know the answer already?

117
00:09:29,379 --> 00:09:30,153
Let go.

118
00:09:30,234 --> 00:09:31,756
Let me go!

119
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:35,057
You're driving me crazy.

120
00:09:35,302 --> 00:09:37,513
What can I do...

121
00:09:38,206 --> 00:09:41,059
to make you like me?

122
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,513
Do I look like a naive little lamb 
waiting to be slaughtered?

123
00:09:56,663 --> 00:10:00,793
Think I don't get that it's all an act
to make your strategic marriage happen?

124
00:10:02,314 --> 00:10:05,656
Don't mention the word marriage 
in my presence again.

125
00:10:25,694 --> 00:10:27,705
Gangmo.

126
00:10:28,838 --> 00:10:31,852
Ever loved someone before?

127
00:10:35,142 --> 00:10:37,234
Then again...

128
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:40,831
I've known you since middle school,

129
00:10:41,402 --> 00:10:44,608
and I've never seen you 
date anyone before.

130
00:10:50,932 --> 00:10:52,882
Is it indigestion?

131
00:10:53,263 --> 00:10:55,847
I feel all stuffy inside.

132
00:11:01,822 --> 00:11:11,105
<i>{\a6}~ Patty Kim's Mist ~</i>

132
00:11:01,822 --> 00:11:11,105
That shadow of yours...

133
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:20,822
I always cherished.

134
00:11:21,239 --> 00:11:25,748
What would be the point of reminiscing,

135
00:11:25,829 --> 00:11:30,868
When all they are 
is nothing but bygones?

136
00:11:31,005 --> 00:11:41,022
But I still so fervently
miss those memories.

137
00:11:50,618 --> 00:11:57,372
Where could that man be?

138
00:11:58,072 --> 00:12:04,083
She's really a good singer.
I'm glad we came here tonight.

139
00:12:07,983 --> 00:12:10,526
Are those two dating now?

140
00:12:10,599 --> 00:12:12,900
What the hell...

141
00:12:53,454 --> 00:12:57,962
I enjoyed the song,
you really look great on the stage.

142
00:13:01,117 --> 00:13:02,644
Thank you.

143
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:05,279
<i>Let's go, Ma'am.</i>

144
00:13:18,492 --> 00:13:21,048
Is that woman the owner of this place?

145
00:13:57,578 --> 00:13:59,778
Why are you drinking so much?

146
00:13:59,928 --> 00:14:01,653
I feel stuffy.

147
00:14:02,265 --> 00:14:04,791
Feel as if my chest 
is just about to burst.

148
00:14:10,568 --> 00:14:12,901
Bring some drinks to that table.

149
00:14:13,037 --> 00:14:16,012
<i>Will you drink in the hall?</i>

150
00:14:29,992 --> 00:14:34,597
If I inherit the company from Dad,

151
00:14:35,725 --> 00:14:38,320
my mother will be glad, right?

152
00:14:44,496 --> 00:14:50,773
<i>I wonder if she's even alive, 
living somewhere...</i>

153
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:56,473
I'm sure she's doing fine.

154
00:14:56,677 --> 00:15:02,532
When she gave birth to me, 
she was even younger than I am now.

155
00:15:03,496 --> 00:15:08,632
And she was betrayed by the
man she loved, at that young age.

156
00:15:09,556 --> 00:15:12,395
Will she really be doing fine?

157
00:15:17,774 --> 00:15:21,375
<i>That's what men call "love."</i>

158
00:15:23,234 --> 00:15:24,784
<i>They completely swallow it 
when it's sweet,</i>

159
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,678
<i>then spit it out at the
first sign of bitterness.</i>

160
00:15:28,343 --> 00:15:33,316
Marriage?!
I don't need any of that.

161
00:15:34,718 --> 00:15:39,157
I'll only look forward to the day
I can run that company on my own.

162
00:15:56,102 --> 00:15:58,672
Sure tastes nice.

163
00:15:59,423 --> 00:16:02,988
So what's the occasion?
Paying me a visit.

164
00:16:03,434 --> 00:16:05,573
Your sister.

165
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,301
Jeongyeon.
What kind of person is she?

166
00:16:11,561 --> 00:16:15,544
Are you coveting our company?

167
00:16:16,887 --> 00:16:18,831
Think I don't know you?

168
00:16:19,021 --> 00:16:22,581
There's no way you'd be interested 
in someone like Jeongyeon.

169
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:25,094
And why is that?

170
00:16:25,586 --> 00:16:29,529
Her mother...
She was a bar girl,

171
00:16:29,597 --> 00:16:31,743
and that explains 
that brat's personality.

172
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:33,292
Jeongshik.

173
00:16:33,781 --> 00:16:35,588
Watch what you say, will you?

174
00:16:35,853 --> 00:16:36,903
What?

175
00:16:38,507 --> 00:16:42,726
I'm thinking of marrying Jeongyeon.

176
00:16:43,037 --> 00:16:47,082
Wh...What? Marry her?!

177
00:16:48,685 --> 00:16:50,723
<i>Hey, you...</i>

178
00:16:52,346 --> 00:16:57,548
Fine, make her your wife or whatever, 
it's none of my business.

179
00:16:57,684 --> 00:17:01,923
But Manbo Construction, that's mine.
Are we clear?

180
00:17:03,785 --> 00:17:04,966
You little...

181
00:17:05,101 --> 00:17:06,650
Did you just laugh at me?

182
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,169
You're not concerned in the
slightest about me, is that it?

183
00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:16,987
You know? It's funny.

184
00:17:18,101 --> 00:17:21,171
You don't concern me one bit,

185
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:26,171
so why is Lee Gangmo
always getting on my nerves?

186
00:17:26,823 --> 00:17:29,610
You little prick, I just ought to...

187
00:17:29,787 --> 00:17:30,982
Listen, Hwang Jeongshik.

188
00:17:31,145 --> 00:17:32,979
You're my friend.

189
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:37,721
Do I look like the kind of creep who 
would fight with a friend over a company?

190
00:17:43,347 --> 00:17:45,694
Must be out of money, I bet?

191
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:50,398
When you inherit the company,

192
00:17:50,726 --> 00:17:52,966
then you'll be thankful to me.

193
00:17:53,273 --> 00:17:58,464
Because I'll help our Manbo 
Construction to the very top.

194
00:18:05,435 --> 00:18:07,403
I'll get going.

195
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:21,432
Then again...

196
00:18:21,807 --> 00:18:26,486
Having someone like him 
under you is not too bad.

197
00:18:27,407 --> 00:18:29,479
The stairs...

198
00:18:30,023 --> 00:18:31,761
Where are we?

199
00:18:31,925 --> 00:18:33,759
I asked you where...

200
00:18:33,854 --> 00:18:37,316
Be quiet.
You'll wake everyone up.

201
00:18:37,834 --> 00:18:40,402
Gangmo!

202
00:18:40,551 --> 00:18:42,711
Lee Gangmo...

203
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,199
I'm not going anywhere.

204
00:18:44,322 --> 00:18:47,202
Here... Go in.

205
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:55,163
If you abandon me,

206
00:18:55,754 --> 00:18:57,839
you're dead.

207
00:19:01,469 --> 00:19:04,580
I won't let you get away with it.

208
00:19:05,884 --> 00:19:08,791
If you do that...

209
00:19:39,897 --> 00:19:45,173
You asked me if I ever
loved anyone before, right?

210
00:19:49,727 --> 00:19:52,156
The one I loved...

211
00:19:54,706 --> 00:19:56,843
is none other than you.

212
00:19:57,101 --> 00:19:59,599
<i>Hwang Jeongyeon.</i>

213
00:20:02,048 --> 00:20:04,462
It's the first time I confess it,

214
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:13,782
but I'm sorry to have done it
while you were sleeping, like a coward.

215
00:20:18,619 --> 00:20:21,829
But one day,
I'll tell you right before you.

216
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,033
I'll say that I love you 
with confidence.

217
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:33,655
Until that day comes...

218
00:20:37,259 --> 00:20:39,673
Until that day,

219
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,764
don't ever let anyone else
take you away from me,

220
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:47,250
and wait for me.

221
00:21:03,905 --> 00:21:08,137
<i>Think I don't get that it's all an act
to make your strategic marriage happen?</i>

222
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:12,351
Don't mention the word marriage 
in my presence again.

223
00:21:33,117 --> 00:21:35,781
Why are those damned meetings 
always so long?

224
00:21:35,876 --> 00:21:38,104
Ohh... Have a seat.

225
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,097
Look, Director Jo.

226
00:21:46,249 --> 00:21:47,771
Yes, Congressman.

227
00:21:48,043 --> 00:21:55,189
I'm afraid you'll have to concede to
Director Min at the upcoming elections.

228
00:21:57,236 --> 00:21:59,319
What are you trying to say?

229
00:21:59,481 --> 00:22:06,213
The party's top brass decided
to push for Director Min.

230
00:22:07,137 --> 00:22:08,564
Thank you.

231
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:09,827
Congressman!

232
00:22:09,949 --> 00:22:13,617
I'll make a personal effort to guarantee
you're next in line for a recommendation.

233
00:22:13,726 --> 00:22:17,247
And based on what kind of standards 
was this recommendation assigned?

234
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:21,282
Why should we keep
beating around the bush?!

235
00:22:21,567 --> 00:22:26,988
This recommendation was strictly
based upon performance on the field.

236
00:22:27,173 --> 00:22:28,482
Performance?!

237
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:33,808
If we consider all the money Director Min
donated to the national development fund...

238
00:22:33,957 --> 00:22:37,707
through the construction committee, 
your contributions pale in comparison.

239
00:22:37,842 --> 00:22:39,717
<i>Don't let this disappoint you.</i>

240
00:22:39,853 --> 00:22:43,562
You have my support 
at the next elections.

241
00:22:45,776 --> 00:22:47,410
Ahh... What is he doing?

242
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:49,842
Don't mind him.

243
00:22:51,024 --> 00:22:52,736
That's that.

244
00:22:52,973 --> 00:22:54,502
How did the subway matter go?

245
00:22:54,624 --> 00:22:59,039
Yes... Daeryuk Construction is currently
undergoing severe financial pressure.

246
00:22:59,175 --> 00:23:01,104
Barring any unforeseen occurrence,

247
00:23:01,226 --> 00:23:04,343
Manbo Construction 
will be put in charge.

248
00:23:04,506 --> 00:23:07,549
Being recommended is
not the end of your worries.

249
00:23:07,685 --> 00:23:09,437
If you truly want to win the elections,

250
00:23:09,573 --> 00:23:13,010
you need to cut your ties with damaged 
goods like Hong Gipyo once and for all!

251
00:23:13,209 --> 00:23:15,967
I'm well aware of that, Congressman.

252
00:23:22,288 --> 00:23:25,694
So first they set me loose 
on the hunt for their own good,

253
00:23:25,891 --> 00:23:27,908
and now that they don't 
need me anymore, I'm abandoned?

254
00:23:28,058 --> 00:23:34,782
I was surprised to hear
you weren't recommended.

255
00:23:34,959 --> 00:23:41,996
Considering the situation, 
you'll have to push my candidacy for real.

256
00:23:43,627 --> 00:23:47,054
I'm not taking this lying down.

257
00:23:47,938 --> 00:23:53,018
If that's what it takes, I'll even run
against Min Honggi as an independent.

258
00:23:53,174 --> 00:23:54,227
Director.

259
00:23:54,363 --> 00:23:56,917
That fool sure can't
have solid financial backing,

260
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:00,191
so even if I have to cover
the four corners in gold,

261
00:24:00,327 --> 00:24:05,971
I'll bring ruin to that prick 
once and for all.

262
00:24:07,492 --> 00:24:11,323
I'm a businessman.

263
00:24:11,956 --> 00:24:13,850
And what are you implying with that?

264
00:24:14,026 --> 00:24:20,887
That I can't throw money at a venture 
that is not worth investing in.

265
00:24:21,911 --> 00:24:23,865
What did you just say?

266
00:24:24,002 --> 00:24:25,360
I'm not worth investing in?!

267
00:24:25,455 --> 00:24:30,278
To be honest, if you end up 
losing at these elections,

268
00:24:30,685 --> 00:24:33,598
wouldn't that spell
the end for the both of us?

269
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:38,530
Have you already forgotten
who is behind all your success?

270
00:24:38,638 --> 00:24:42,469
Seems like you 
misunderstood what I meant.

271
00:24:42,928 --> 00:24:47,956
Rather than wasting money so unwisely,
planning for the future would be...

272
00:24:48,065 --> 00:24:50,198
Chairman Hwang!

273
00:24:53,173 --> 00:24:58,634
So all your day-by-day reservations
about our kids' marriage...

274
00:24:58,757 --> 00:25:01,528
were all because of this?

275
00:25:03,489 --> 00:25:05,448
Seems like you had a drink 
too many tonight.

276
00:25:05,651 --> 00:25:09,306
Let's talk again soon.

277
00:25:09,673 --> 00:25:11,602
Let's go.

278
00:25:23,667 --> 00:25:27,498
What?! Cover the four corners in gold?!

279
00:25:27,661 --> 00:25:34,155
What does he think my hard-earned
money is, manure from his latrine?

280
00:25:34,332 --> 00:25:38,299
Will it be all right?
Seems like you riled him up real nice?!

281
00:25:38,475 --> 00:25:41,152
If the republicans don't
vouch for him, it's game over.

282
00:25:41,247 --> 00:25:43,764
How would he possibly...

283
00:25:47,038 --> 00:25:49,333
You're already leaving?

284
00:25:49,493 --> 00:25:50,909
Right.

285
00:25:51,411 --> 00:25:57,090
You'll have to bring
some consolation to your father.

286
00:26:07,288 --> 00:26:09,407
What's the matter, Dad?

287
00:26:10,954 --> 00:26:15,086
Both your marriage and
my recommendation, it's all over!

288
00:26:15,222 --> 00:26:15,928
<i>Honey!</i>

289
00:26:15,996 --> 00:26:19,288
- You're drunk, just...
- Let go!

290
00:26:19,508 --> 00:26:21,108
Minwoo, you!

291
00:26:21,296 --> 00:26:24,124
Act on Daeryuk Construction
behind Chairman Hwang's back.

292
00:26:24,301 --> 00:26:27,860
I want them filing for
bankruptcy in no time!

293
00:26:28,349 --> 00:26:31,909
Director, do you have some kind of plan?

294
00:26:32,072 --> 00:26:36,820
To all the people who plotted against me,
Hong Gipyo is just a time bomb.

295
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,464
If my guess is right,

296
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:44,780
he must carry some kind of account
listing all their bribes and dealings so far.

297
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,920
So you want to use Chairman Hong's 
secret account against them?

298
00:26:49,002 --> 00:26:51,922
I know the type 
like the palm of my hands.

299
00:26:52,371 --> 00:26:58,049
Push them into a corner, 
and they'll spell their own demise.

300
00:26:58,144 --> 00:27:00,671
But we could bear the grunt as well.

301
00:27:00,753 --> 00:27:04,115
It's the last card on the table for me!

302
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:08,272
Jaechun, you start spying
on Hong Gipyo's every move!

303
00:27:08,666 --> 00:27:10,120
I will, Director.

304
00:27:10,242 --> 00:27:12,810
Min Honggi, Hwang Taeseop...

305
00:27:12,919 --> 00:27:18,044
Just wait and see 
the end that awaits you.

306
00:27:31,956 --> 00:27:33,024
This is serious, Chairman.

307
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,195
Our checks are bouncing.

308
00:27:35,842 --> 00:27:36,631
What?

309
00:27:36,767 --> 00:27:41,889
Someone is purposely spreading rumors
about us among financial circles.

310
00:27:45,636 --> 00:27:49,502
<i>~ Seoul Subway Route Changed ~
Stopping Excessive Speculation the Reason</i>

311
00:28:04,231 --> 00:28:05,614
How about him...

312
00:28:05,791 --> 00:28:09,641
If there is anything you wish
to say, go ahead and tell me.

313
00:28:11,358 --> 00:28:15,070
I just wanted to ask
for your help one more time.

314
00:28:15,233 --> 00:28:17,909
If we manage to 
keep the subway contract,

315
00:28:18,072 --> 00:28:19,546
we can get back 
on our feet in no time.

316
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:22,725
Daeryuk Construction's deadline
is at the end of the month.

317
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:25,103
Look, Miss Yoo...

318
00:28:25,361 --> 00:28:26,991
You know my answer.

319
00:28:27,086 --> 00:28:29,892
That his business policy
is to be a generous lender...

320
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:32,670
and a very thorough exacter.

321
00:28:32,948 --> 00:28:33,906
Where is he now?

322
00:28:33,987 --> 00:28:37,896
- I'll just have a talk with him, and...
- If you fail to pay interests on time,

323
00:28:38,469 --> 00:28:42,805
you will lose every single square inch 
of land you used as collateral.

324
00:28:43,023 --> 00:28:45,412
Can you do this to me?

325
00:28:46,612 --> 00:28:48,851
Have a nice day.

326
00:29:12,636 --> 00:29:17,237
So you really have no
intention of saving that man?

327
00:29:18,419 --> 00:29:20,150
He broke our rules.

328
00:29:20,286 --> 00:29:23,831
But you're still 
helping Hwang Taeseop...

329
00:29:24,891 --> 00:29:27,635
Daughters sure can be scary.

330
00:29:28,423 --> 00:29:33,819
I heard you crying 
all night by yourself.

331
00:29:34,129 --> 00:29:36,890
Was it Jeongyeon?

332
00:29:37,736 --> 00:29:42,025
<i>If those ties were meant to be broken, 
better not linger on.</i>

333
00:29:42,745 --> 00:29:47,894
Those wounds time so painfully 
cured might open up again.

334
00:29:57,141 --> 00:29:58,864
Have you been able to reach 
Director Min Honggi?

335
00:29:58,973 --> 00:30:01,255
He hasn't been answering our calls.

336
00:30:01,418 --> 00:30:03,429
He really...

337
00:30:03,864 --> 00:30:06,096
We're heading to Namsan right away.

338
00:30:06,272 --> 00:30:07,400
Namsan?!

339
00:30:07,468 --> 00:30:10,090
Are you saying we're going
straight to KCIA headquarters?

340
00:30:11,272 --> 00:30:12,807
KC...IA?

341
00:30:12,915 --> 00:30:14,736
<i>Ahh... You really are something.</i>

342
00:30:14,872 --> 00:30:17,032
<i>How many times do I have to tell you?</i>

343
00:30:17,168 --> 00:30:19,328
<i>If you say it's Daeryuk Construction's
Hong Gipyo, he'll let me in.</i>

344
00:30:19,423 --> 00:30:21,752
Let me get in contact with him!

345
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:23,872
If you keep this up,
things will get serious.

346
00:30:23,994 --> 00:30:27,567
Until I meet Director Min,
I'm not moving a foot.

347
00:30:27,675 --> 00:30:29,034
Just take him out.

348
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:30,229
Look...

349
00:30:30,365 --> 00:30:31,928
If you tell him it's
Chairman Hong, he'll know.

350
00:30:32,023 --> 00:30:34,291
Uh? Let me get in touch!

351
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,637
<i>Come on, listen to me!</i>

352
00:30:55,154 --> 00:30:56,387
Director!

353
00:30:58,477 --> 00:31:00,343
Are you out of your mind?

354
00:31:00,863 --> 00:31:02,612
How can you show up here?

355
00:31:02,857 --> 00:31:04,786
Help me out.

356
00:31:05,046 --> 00:31:09,456
If this keeps up,
my company will collapse.

357
00:31:11,351 --> 00:31:13,872
Listen well, Chairman Hong.

358
00:31:14,035 --> 00:31:16,820
I'm in no position to help anyone now.

359
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:20,037
I myself am walking on
thin ice because of you.

360
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:22,314
Because of me?!

361
00:31:22,579 --> 00:31:25,615
Do you know why the subway route 
was changed so suddenly?

362
00:31:25,778 --> 00:31:27,735
Because you're running amuck 
all over the place,

363
00:31:27,843 --> 00:31:29,922
so Director Jo and 
Hwang Taeseop put a stop to it.

364
00:31:30,017 --> 00:31:31,484
Is that clear?

365
00:31:31,634 --> 00:31:35,397
So that's supposed to be my fault?

366
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:39,630
You...

367
00:31:39,929 --> 00:31:44,113
Keep prancing around like this,
and your downfall won't be so pretty.

368
00:31:44,263 --> 00:31:45,689
<i>Are we square?</i>

369
00:31:45,838 --> 00:31:48,433
<i>Let's show some prudence,
that's what I mean.</i>

370
00:31:51,958 --> 00:31:55,798
Also, don't ever come 
looking for me again.

371
00:32:01,113 --> 00:32:02,781
Prudence?!

372
00:32:05,059 --> 00:32:06,873
You tell me that?

373
00:32:08,163 --> 00:32:11,357
So should I just quietly go belly up?!

374
00:32:31,954 --> 00:32:34,976
Here's a draft for our apartment ads.

375
00:32:36,077 --> 00:32:38,318
Leave it there.

376
00:32:38,836 --> 00:32:43,425
We have a meeting with a reporter.

377
00:32:43,724 --> 00:32:46,169
You go ahead as you see fit.

378
00:32:46,454 --> 00:32:48,329
By myself?!

379
00:32:51,425 --> 00:32:53,546
All right.

380
00:33:06,049 --> 00:33:09,267
I don't care whether 
you believe me or not.

381
00:33:11,557 --> 00:33:14,108
And that's because I love you.

382
00:33:18,469 --> 00:33:21,607
I'm never going to give up on you.

383
00:33:44,286 --> 00:33:45,864
<i>Agasshi.</i>

384
00:33:48,486 --> 00:33:50,239
It's this, right?

385
00:33:52,575 --> 00:33:54,192
Sorry.

386
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:57,514
I'm so busy with everything,
I even left behind this draft.

387
00:33:57,745 --> 00:34:00,054
But hasn't the reporter arrived yet?

388
00:34:00,217 --> 00:34:02,265
Aigoo... I apologize.

389
00:34:02,355 --> 00:34:03,668
I'm a little late.

390
00:34:03,817 --> 00:34:05,896
<i>No, I just got here myself.</i>

391
00:34:06,005 --> 00:34:08,362
<i>- Have a seat.
- Yes.</i>

392
00:34:10,228 --> 00:34:12,978
It's the draft for our apartment ads.

393
00:34:13,087 --> 00:34:16,083
I see.
Let's take a look.

394
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:21,890
Seonsaengnim.

395
00:34:24,683 --> 00:34:26,523
It's me, Gangmo.

396
00:34:26,782 --> 00:34:28,630
Lee Gangmo.

397
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:32,148
You!

398
00:34:32,645 --> 00:34:34,050
Hey!

399
00:34:34,376 --> 00:34:36,428
Lee Gangmo!

400
00:34:37,447 --> 00:34:38,751
I'm so happy to meet you!

401
00:34:38,846 --> 00:34:40,734
Seonsaengnim!

402
00:34:44,464 --> 00:34:47,004
Never been here before, have you?

403
00:34:49,561 --> 00:34:51,175
Have a seat.

404
00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:56,296
I'd heard you became a journalist.

405
00:34:56,625 --> 00:34:59,833
I always felt so guilty, as I thought
you quit at our school because of me.

406
00:34:59,955 --> 00:35:02,454
Never know when they might 
fire me here as well.

407
00:35:02,713 --> 00:35:06,503
The higher-ups don't seem
to like the articles I write.

408
00:35:07,304 --> 00:35:10,039
Haven't changed a bit, Seonsaengnim.

409
00:35:12,198 --> 00:35:14,200
Yes, Goryeo Ilbo speaking.

410
00:35:14,363 --> 00:35:17,715
<i>Can I speak to Reporter Yoon Gihoon?</i>

411
00:35:17,979 --> 00:35:19,485
That would be me?!

412
00:35:19,621 --> 00:35:20,640
Who is it?

413
00:35:20,775 --> 00:35:25,245
<i>I'm a businessman in the construction
sector, my name is Hong Gipyo.</i>

414
00:35:25,435 --> 00:35:27,372
Hong Gipyo...

415
00:35:27,575 --> 00:35:31,189
Ahh... Chairman Hong Gipyo
of Daeryuk Construction?

416
00:35:36,543 --> 00:35:39,829
I'd like to have a meeting with you.

417
00:35:40,006 --> 00:35:41,296
Yes.

418
00:35:42,465 --> 00:35:44,962
Yes, of course.
Don't you worry.

419
00:35:45,288 --> 00:35:48,127
I'll see you then.

420
00:35:49,996 --> 00:35:51,714
Sorry.

421
00:35:52,115 --> 00:35:54,159
What did Chairman Hong Gipyo call for?

422
00:35:54,349 --> 00:35:55,816
You know Chairman Hong?

423
00:35:55,939 --> 00:35:59,603
Ahh... You said you work for 
Manbo Construction, right?!

424
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:03,421
Seeing as he wants to meet, 
he'll probably give me a good lead or two.

425
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:05,255
Lead?!

426
00:36:06,578 --> 00:36:07,904
That's that.

427
00:36:08,121 --> 00:36:10,077
How are you doing these days?

428
00:36:14,818 --> 00:36:18,731
I'll return to the Inspection
Department, if you don't mind.

429
00:36:18,989 --> 00:36:20,415
It's still not the time.

430
00:36:20,537 --> 00:36:23,472
Continue sticking to Min Honggi.

431
00:36:23,621 --> 00:36:26,501
We have no more reason
to keep an eye on him.

432
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:32,162
Are you implying that it's already
game over between him and me?

433
00:36:33,672 --> 00:36:35,704
I bet everyone thinks so.

434
00:36:35,827 --> 00:36:38,965
But this game is still far from over.

435
00:36:39,087 --> 00:36:41,546
The tide will soon turn.

436
00:36:43,778 --> 00:36:45,395
Director.

437
00:36:46,385 --> 00:36:49,117
Hong Gipyo is meeting with
a Goryeo Ilbo reporter.

438
00:36:49,267 --> 00:36:50,313
Goryeo Ilbo?!

439
00:36:50,435 --> 00:36:51,495
Who's the reporter?

440
00:36:51,644 --> 00:36:53,791
Political Editor Yoon Gihoon.

441
00:36:53,966 --> 00:36:55,285
Yoon Gihoon?

442
00:36:55,435 --> 00:36:57,241
He sometimes writes 
problematic articles,

443
00:36:57,364 --> 00:37:00,529
so we've had our eyes on him 
for a while already.

444
00:37:01,879 --> 00:37:04,767
Bring in that reporter without
letting Hong Gipyo suspect anything.

445
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:06,329
Yes, Director.

446
00:37:09,565 --> 00:37:11,682
What is the matter?

447
00:37:12,001 --> 00:37:14,652
Know "catching two birds with a stone"?

448
00:37:14,964 --> 00:37:17,409
There are two people who've been 
belittling my every move.

449
00:37:17,545 --> 00:37:20,113
Min Honggi and Hwang Taeseop.

450
00:37:21,037 --> 00:37:29,567
The stone I'm about to throw will 
make a bloody mess out of those rats.

451
00:37:33,607 --> 00:37:35,341
Go ahead and tell me.

452
00:37:35,504 --> 00:37:38,302
What is this important information 
you wanted to disclose?

453
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:40,408
By any chance,

454
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:46,361
have you heard of a certain
"national development fund"?

455
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:51,225
I'll get straight to the point.

456
00:37:52,608 --> 00:37:56,034
During the six years I presided
over the construction committee,

457
00:37:56,319 --> 00:38:04,052
the government received secret funding 
from me at the end of every fiscal quarter.

458
00:38:06,706 --> 00:38:08,657
Who made those transactions?

459
00:38:08,834 --> 00:38:12,828
Director Min Honggi of the KCIA.

460
00:38:13,955 --> 00:38:16,921
It's much more serious than I thought.

461
00:38:18,188 --> 00:38:20,847
Is there any evidence
or anyone willing to testify?

462
00:38:21,445 --> 00:38:25,262
I have an account 
listing all our dealings.

463
00:38:26,407 --> 00:38:28,577
<i>Once that account 
is exposed to the public,</i>

464
00:38:28,781 --> 00:38:34,779
not only those involved, but the 
current regime would fall as well.

465
00:38:35,744 --> 00:38:38,773
But you won't be safe, either.

466
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:43,705
I openly admit I helped those
people corrupt our society,

467
00:38:44,031 --> 00:38:47,054
and I plan to face the
repercussions without reserves.

468
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:54,648
<i>You must let the 
people know about this.</i>

469
00:38:55,137 --> 00:38:57,786
All the people who took money from me.

470
00:38:58,492 --> 00:39:03,443
All those parasites using
authority for their own means.

471
00:39:03,742 --> 00:39:07,791
Our society must be rid of 
all those cancers.

472
00:39:09,042 --> 00:39:11,377
Did you bring the account with you?

473
00:39:11,595 --> 00:39:13,089
No.

474
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:17,804
I'm keeping it in a safe place.

475
00:39:20,195 --> 00:39:22,002
Let's do this.

476
00:39:22,178 --> 00:39:27,545
Even with that account, no article on it
would get through this regime's censorship.

477
00:39:27,749 --> 00:39:30,753
<i>I'll ask the opposition's cooperation,
and see if they can help us.</i>

478
00:39:30,916 --> 00:39:34,286
And that is when I'll publish the news.

479
00:39:34,598 --> 00:39:35,861
Yes.

480
00:39:36,378 --> 00:39:39,801
I know a congressman
from the opposition party.

481
00:39:39,951 --> 00:39:42,573
I'll discuss this with him as well.

482
00:39:42,763 --> 00:39:47,476
Then, we'll exchange
the account here, tomorrow.

483
00:39:47,842 --> 00:39:49,514
All right.

484
00:40:15,058 --> 00:40:17,001
Reporter Yoon, I believe?

485
00:40:17,385 --> 00:40:18,672
And you are?

486
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:20,071
Take him in.

487
00:40:20,492 --> 00:40:22,326
Who are you? Let me go!

488
00:40:22,421 --> 00:40:25,402
Let go! What are you doing?

489
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:36,614
Confess.

490
00:40:37,294 --> 00:40:40,350
What did you talk about with Hong Gipyo?

491
00:40:41,342 --> 00:40:42,714
Listen.

492
00:40:42,931 --> 00:40:44,738
I am a reporter.

493
00:40:44,901 --> 00:40:50,291
Being a KCIA agent doesn't give you the 
right to oppress innocent people, does it?

494
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:52,790
What did you say?

495
00:40:52,925 --> 00:40:56,240
Do you have a death wish?

496
00:40:56,417 --> 00:40:59,188
How can you be so rude to a reporter?

497
00:41:11,853 --> 00:41:14,869
Do you recognize me?

498
00:41:15,833 --> 00:41:20,403
If I hadn't seen your photo,
I almost wouldn't have recognized you.

499
00:41:20,671 --> 00:41:23,487
Jo Minwoo's... father?!

500
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:25,823
I see you remember me.

501
00:41:26,095 --> 00:41:27,902
You were my son's respected teacher,

502
00:41:28,065 --> 00:41:31,263
so I truly feel sorry for
bringing you to such a place.

503
00:41:32,362 --> 00:41:35,202
I think there was some
kind of misunderstanding.

504
00:41:35,691 --> 00:41:37,308
I ask you to let me out of here.

505
00:41:37,417 --> 00:41:41,832
If you cooperate with our investigation,
you'll be free to leave in no time.

506
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:45,065
I already told them everything I know.

507
00:41:45,188 --> 00:41:46,974
Yoon Seonsaengnim.

508
00:41:48,074 --> 00:41:50,057
No... Reporter Yoon.

509
00:41:51,153 --> 00:41:53,861
I'll ask you again from the beginning.

510
00:41:54,103 --> 00:41:59,024
Did Chairman Hong Gipyo
mention a certain account?

511
00:42:02,593 --> 00:42:04,791
An account?!

512
00:42:06,254 --> 00:42:09,678
Did he, or did he not?

513
00:42:10,065 --> 00:42:12,748
I don't know what you're talking...

514
00:42:20,428 --> 00:42:21,906
Hang him upside down.

515
00:42:22,002 --> 00:42:23,999
If he doesn't confess within an hour, 
question him with water,

516
00:42:24,094 --> 00:42:26,648
and if he still refuses,
move onto electroshock.

517
00:42:30,805 --> 00:42:32,750
I guarantee you.

518
00:42:32,872 --> 00:42:34,570
Only a night spent here,

519
00:42:34,692 --> 00:42:39,421
and you'll feel the consequences
for the rest of your days.

520
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:41,023
Mister Jo!

521
00:42:41,104 --> 00:42:42,409
Mister Jo!!

522
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:44,387
Mister Jo...

523
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:50,167
He still hasn't come back?!

524
00:42:50,289 --> 00:42:51,906
That's right.

525
00:42:52,791 --> 00:42:55,982
Seems like they were looking for him 
all day at the office, too.

526
00:42:56,429 --> 00:42:59,256
This has never happened before.

527
00:43:03,213 --> 00:43:04,602
Look at me...

528
00:43:04,757 --> 00:43:06,433
Please, come on in.

529
00:43:06,528 --> 00:43:07,805
No.

530
00:43:08,022 --> 00:43:11,446
We'll come again when he's back.

531
00:43:11,555 --> 00:43:12,750
Yes...

532
00:43:13,062 --> 00:43:16,103
Have a good night, then.

533
00:43:21,431 --> 00:43:22,971
Something feels strange.

534
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:25,932
He said he was going to
meet Chairman Hong today.

535
00:43:26,054 --> 00:43:29,410
They're probably out somewhere, drinking.

536
00:43:30,158 --> 00:43:32,276
Will he recognize me?

537
00:43:37,159 --> 00:43:39,765
Is... Isn't that him?

538
00:43:42,378 --> 00:43:43,976
<i>Right?</i>

539
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:54,838
If you had confessed earlier,

540
00:43:54,961 --> 00:43:58,873
you wouldn't have forced all this 
onto yourself, don't you agree?

541
00:44:03,847 --> 00:44:08,712
It's a relief the boys
didn't mess with your face.

542
00:44:08,902 --> 00:44:11,700
Meet Hong Gipyo as planned, tomorrow.

543
00:44:11,809 --> 00:44:14,476
We'll take care of all the rest.

544
00:44:14,676 --> 00:44:18,991
Did I make myself clear,
Yoon Seonsaengnim?

545
00:44:43,951 --> 00:44:45,614
Seonsaengnim!

546
00:44:46,255 --> 00:44:47,578
<i>Seonsaengnim.</i>

547
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,739
Seonsaengnim...

548
00:44:58,283 --> 00:44:59,411
Bring him inside!

549
00:44:59,507 --> 00:45:01,082
No...

550
00:45:02,291 --> 00:45:06,363
Let's go somewhere else,
I need to take a breather.

551
00:45:18,773 --> 00:45:23,174
I know those were KCIA agents.

552
00:45:26,295 --> 00:45:29,257
It involves Chairman Hong, doesn't it?

553
00:45:29,651 --> 00:45:31,268
What on earth is going on?

554
00:45:31,376 --> 00:45:34,830
Don't try to get involved in this.

555
00:45:34,936 --> 00:45:36,181
Seonsaengnim.

556
00:45:36,344 --> 00:45:39,699
Don't risk your life for nothing!

557
00:45:41,289 --> 00:45:46,152
Is it serious enough that
people might risk their lives?

558
00:45:46,261 --> 00:45:48,410
Please!

559
00:45:49,715 --> 00:45:53,677
Please... 
Enough with this.

560
00:46:05,014 --> 00:46:08,797
We've heard Lee Hajeong is about to finalize
her contract with Hyeseong Construction.

561
00:46:09,015 --> 00:46:11,310
Whatever it takes, we must
convince her to change her mind.

562
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:16,065
She fits the image of 
our apartments just right.

563
00:46:21,648 --> 00:46:25,912
Manbo Construction's Chief 
of Planning is looking for you.

564
00:46:27,622 --> 00:46:29,186
How bothersome...

565
00:46:29,434 --> 00:46:30,974
Send him packing.

566
00:46:31,210 --> 00:46:32,609
Yes.

567
00:46:35,236 --> 00:46:38,403
How can you come here just like that?

568
00:46:38,578 --> 00:46:40,045
I'll just have a talk with Hajeong.

569
00:46:40,167 --> 00:46:42,531
<i>Ahh... She said no...</i>

570
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,389
- Tell them to come in.
- What?!

571
00:46:54,795 --> 00:46:58,137
So you wanted me to be the
model for your apartment ads?

572
00:46:58,368 --> 00:46:59,753
Yes.

573
00:47:11,731 --> 00:47:13,905
<i>Here... Cheers.</i>

574
00:47:22,672 --> 00:47:24,999
I'm not really much of a drinker.

575
00:47:25,916 --> 00:47:27,644
Chief Jo.

576
00:47:27,875 --> 00:47:32,005
Do you know it's only because of you
that I signed with Manbo Construction?

577
00:47:32,168 --> 00:47:33,377
Is that so?

578
00:47:33,513 --> 00:47:34,952
It's an honor.

579
00:47:35,238 --> 00:47:37,328
Let's drink the night away.

580
00:47:38,164 --> 00:47:44,263
You'll take good care of me
to the very end, won't you?

581
00:47:47,565 --> 00:47:48,706
Of course.

582
00:47:48,893 --> 00:47:50,999
Don't worry and just drink.

583
00:47:51,719 --> 00:47:55,686
Then, will you pour me one?

584
00:48:03,449 --> 00:48:05,019
Here...

585
00:48:16,427 --> 00:48:19,280
So Jo Minwoo knows how to smile?!

586
00:48:20,464 --> 00:48:23,921
"Of course, don't worry and just drink."

587
00:48:32,643 --> 00:48:36,223
Can't you send your colleague home?

588
00:48:43,257 --> 00:48:48,346
I wanted to drink alone with you...

589
00:48:51,009 --> 00:48:53,981
Shall we go somewhere else?

590
00:48:54,851 --> 00:48:58,056
I'm afraid that's out of the question.

591
00:48:59,031 --> 00:49:03,776
That colleague of mine 
is the woman I love.

592
00:49:04,237 --> 00:49:05,871
What?

593
00:49:07,759 --> 00:49:10,761
<i>And the only reason
I'm acting so kindly with you...</i>

594
00:49:12,259 --> 00:49:16,100
is because she insisted on
having you as our model.

595
00:49:16,290 --> 00:49:19,361
I could easily do without you.

596
00:49:20,322 --> 00:49:22,364
What did you say?

597
00:49:50,528 --> 00:49:55,101
Guess I ruined the mood.
Should we have a drink by ourselves?

598
00:50:08,295 --> 00:50:14,272
<i>{\a6}~ National Development Fund ~

<i>- Committee Members -

600
00:50:24,212 --> 00:50:26,008
Were you looking for me, Chairman?

601
00:50:26,157 --> 00:50:28,168
Have a seat.

602
00:50:37,052 --> 00:50:38,154
Miju.

603
00:50:38,290 --> 00:50:39,662
Yes, Chairman.

You're the only one 
who can help me now.

605
00:50:44,512 --> 00:50:45,381
What?

606
00:50:45,517 --> 00:50:49,141
Listen well to what I'm about to say.

607
00:50:49,673 --> 00:50:54,402
You're smart, so you'll understand 
what I mean right away.

608
00:50:54,555 --> 00:50:57,484
What is the matter?

609
00:51:05,462 --> 00:51:08,731
You must bear in mind what I told you.

610
00:51:08,962 --> 00:51:11,948
Miju, you can do it, right?

611
00:51:12,195 --> 00:51:13,445
Yes, Chairman.

612
00:51:13,594 --> 00:51:15,972
Don't worry about it.

613
00:51:19,694 --> 00:51:21,705
Have a nice day.

00:51:38,231 --> 00:51:40,908
Yes, Hannam-Dong.

615
00:51:42,188 --> 00:51:44,834
The chairman left?

616
00:51:44,989 --> 00:51:46,478
When did he leave?

<i>Just now.</i>

We're one step too late.

00:51:52,550 --> 00:51:54,309
We must go and stop Chairman Hong.

620
00:51:54,445 --> 00:51:56,442
Agents from the Inspection
Department might be there already.

621
00:51:56,577 --> 00:52:01,427
If we leave now, we might
stop him before he gets there.

622
00:52:05,659 --> 00:52:07,065
Just who I was looking for.

623
00:52:07,255 --> 00:52:10,697
Let's have lunch together,
for good old times' sake.

624

You'll have to follow us.

Who are you people?

627
00:52:48,812 --> 00:52:50,240

What are you doing?

00:52:51,639 --> 00:52:52,658
Look!

630
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:54,621
Reporter Yoon!
What is all this about?

631
00:52:54,716 --> 00:52:57,107
Reporter Yoon!

632
00:53:13,634 --> 00:53:15,532
Gangmo...

633
00:53:16,297 --> 00:53:19,014
Tell me everything, now.

What is going on?

635
00:53:22,587 --> 00:53:24,897
I told you, didn't I?

636
00:53:25,087 --> 00:53:29,774
If you get embroiled in all this,
you'll be in danger.

637

Seonsaengnim!

638
00:53:37,064 --> 00:53:38,754
<i>What's that supposed to mean?</i>

639
00:53:38,903 --> 00:53:41,578
Hong Gipyo was arrested by the KCIA?

640
00:53:41,687 --> 00:53:45,287
A secret account of his dealings
with the committee was found.

641
00:53:45,491 --> 00:53:47,583
Secret account?!

642
00:53:47,773 --> 00:53:51,319
He was keeping one?

643
00:53:51,536 --> 00:53:52,718
Yes, Chairman.

644
00:53:52,868 --> 00:53:57,030
If the committee is involved,
then wouldn't you be in danger as well?

645
00:53:57,193 --> 00:54:04,189
After pocketing all that money,
would they possibly come for us?

646
00:54:06,417 --> 00:54:08,088
Open that briefcase.

647
00:54:08,265 --> 00:54:12,856
Let's first hear the reason
why you're doing all this.

648
00:54:13,725 --> 00:54:16,836
Open it right now, you prick!

649
00:54:56,276 --> 00:54:58,409
What is all this?

650
00:54:58,939 --> 00:55:01,181
Can't you see for yourself?

651
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:04,658
It's information and prices
regarding the land around the subway.

652
00:55:04,917 --> 00:55:05,677
What?

653
00:55:05,827 --> 00:55:08,381
He was writing a special
on real estate speculation,

654
00:55:08,517 --> 00:55:11,232
and asked me to help him out 
with some research data,

655
00:55:11,327 --> 00:55:13,773
so is there anything wrong with that?

656
00:55:17,930 --> 00:55:19,198
Director...

657
00:55:21,317 --> 00:55:22,535
Where's the account?

658
00:55:22,657 --> 00:55:24,288
Account?!

659
00:55:24,926 --> 00:55:29,581
I trust you don't mean
our housekeeping account?!

660
00:55:30,756 --> 00:55:34,784
So you want to play
hard to get, is that it?

661
00:55:36,659 --> 00:55:38,737
Search every inch of this fella's house.

662
00:55:38,846 --> 00:55:40,758
Yes, Director.

663
00:55:52,169 --> 00:55:54,533
What are you doing here?

664
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:57,206
- Search every corner.
- Yes.

665
00:56:01,837 --> 00:56:02,982
Who are you people?

666
00:56:03,063 --> 00:56:05,889
What are you doing in
someone else's house?

667
00:56:10,648 --> 00:56:12,617
Where is my husband?

668
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:15,207
Where is he?

669
00:56:20,681 --> 00:56:22,271
Ma'am!

670
00:56:24,423 --> 00:56:26,506
Are you all right, Ma'am?

671
00:56:26,629 --> 00:56:29,074
Seems like it's not here.

672
00:56:38,448 --> 00:56:40,119
Where did you hide that account?

673
00:56:40,241 --> 00:56:42,612
I know nothing about that.

674
00:56:43,771 --> 00:56:48,450
Without that account,
your husband is dead! Got it?

675
00:56:50,253 --> 00:56:52,494
If you want to see him again,

676
00:56:52,590 --> 00:56:55,723
find that account and bring it to us.

677
00:56:57,826 --> 00:56:59,375
My husband...

678
00:56:59,551 --> 00:57:03,070
You didn't harm him, did you?

679
00:57:28,948 --> 00:57:34,342
Unless you want to die here,
I suggest you start talking.

680
00:57:36,529 --> 00:57:38,826
Didn't I tell you...

681
00:57:39,584 --> 00:57:42,281
that there is no account?

682
00:57:54,297 --> 00:57:55,166
Speak!

683
00:57:55,289 --> 00:57:57,805
Where did you hide it?

684
00:58:14,177 --> 00:58:16,242
<i>He fainted.</i>

685
00:58:24,325 --> 00:58:27,951
S...Spare me!

686
00:58:29,481 --> 00:58:33,234
Ever heard of this account before?

687
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:37,890
Want a taste of that as well, 
or will you wake up and confess?

688
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:44,477
The chairman talked about one
regarding dealings with the government.

689
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:46,569
And you don't know where he hid it.

690
00:58:46,678 --> 00:58:51,161
I swear to God, I don't know.

691
00:58:51,311 --> 00:58:53,362
- Tie him up.
- Yes.

692
00:58:54,191 --> 00:58:56,582
I really don't know.

693
00:58:57,234 --> 00:58:59,505
Please, don't do this!

694
00:58:59,614 --> 00:59:02,020
<i>Spare me, Director!</i>

695
00:59:02,821 --> 00:59:05,198
<i>Spare me...</i>

696
00:59:11,366 --> 00:59:12,018
Get out of the way!

697
00:59:12,154 --> 00:59:13,705
I was ordered not to let anyone in.

698
00:59:13,873 --> 00:59:15,634
Ordered?!

699
00:59:15,933 --> 00:59:18,283
Who gave that order, you idiot?

700
00:59:18,419 --> 00:59:20,280
<i>I did.</i>

701
00:59:24,885 --> 00:59:25,959
Chairman Hong...

702
00:59:26,108 --> 00:59:27,059
Why did you arrest him?

703
00:59:27,168 --> 00:59:30,209
Exposing acts of corruption is our
Inspection Department's jurisdiction.

704
00:59:30,318 --> 00:59:34,991
Worry about intelligence gathering,
why interfere in our duties?

705
00:59:36,789 --> 00:59:38,265
What's wrong with you?

706
00:59:38,428 --> 00:59:40,548
What do you plan to accomplish, 
looking for an account that doesn't exist?

707
00:59:40,656 --> 00:59:43,963
We'll see if it exists or not.

708
00:59:44,085 --> 00:59:45,607
And if it does?

709
00:59:45,933 --> 00:59:48,432
- Don't you know the answer?
- You're out of your mind.

710
00:59:48,826 --> 00:59:50,769
You're digging your own grave.

711
00:59:50,878 --> 00:59:55,429
And we'll see who gets buried
inside that grave, won't we?

712
00:59:55,551 --> 01:00:00,295
Be my guest, then.

713
01:00:07,156 --> 01:00:10,905
We searched his house all over,
but no traces of it.

714
01:00:11,041 --> 01:00:13,691
He might have hidden it 
outside somewhere.

715
01:00:13,895 --> 01:00:17,223
Arrest all the committee
members immediately.

716
01:00:17,604 --> 01:00:18,365
What?

717
01:00:18,514 --> 01:00:22,725
All of them, including Hwang Taeseop.

718
01:00:22,978 --> 01:00:24,569
Yes, Sir.

719
01:00:40,815 --> 01:00:43,546
Gangmo, let's go.
