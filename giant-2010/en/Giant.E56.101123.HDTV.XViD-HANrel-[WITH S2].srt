Episode 56

4
00:00:22,969 --> 00:00:24,368
What's the matter?

5
00:00:24,531 --> 00:00:26,053
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:26,236 --> 00:00:29,319
I think we'll have to stop a moment.

7
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:31,937
Really? So pull over.

8
00:00:45,376 --> 00:00:47,969
What?! Isn't that Jo Pilyeon?

9
00:00:54,862 --> 00:00:56,079
Hang tight.

10
00:00:56,175 --> 00:00:57,671
Go faster!

11
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:06,999
They're a little late?

12
00:01:34,249 --> 00:01:35,604
Hello.

13
00:01:35,782 --> 00:01:36,848
Chanseong, where are you?

14
00:01:36,936 --> 00:01:38,118
I...

15
00:01:38,619 --> 00:01:39,901
I can't see...

16
00:01:39,972 --> 00:01:41,423
What?

17
00:01:42,354 --> 00:01:44,348
- Jo Pilyeon...
- Chanseong, where are you?

18
00:01:44,561 --> 00:01:46,152
Jo Pilyeon!

19
00:01:47,198 --> 00:01:48,516
Chanseong!

20
00:01:48,824 --> 00:01:50,651
Chanseong, where... Hello?

21
00:01:50,838 --> 00:01:52,069
He...

22
00:01:54,133 --> 00:01:55,692
What's the matter, Hyung?

23
00:01:57,981 --> 00:02:00,101
I think something might
have happened to Chanseong.

24
00:02:00,259 --> 00:02:02,494
Wait there a moment, will be right back.

25
00:02:16,738 --> 00:02:18,501
What's wrong with you?

26
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:19,954
Wake up.

27
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,358
If you stop here,
Jo Pilyeon will kill us!

28
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,579
Step on it!

29
00:02:30,858 --> 00:02:32,990
Listen to me!

30
00:03:04,436 --> 00:03:06,405
Do you want me
to go down and check?

31
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:09,193
If anyone sees us,
it'll only bring trouble.

32
00:03:09,371 --> 00:03:10,740
Just leave.

33
00:03:10,927 --> 00:03:12,603
All right.

34
00:03:45,631 --> 00:03:48,397
Chanseong... Chanseong!!

35
00:03:58,293 --> 00:03:59,858
Chanseong!

36
00:04:08,604 --> 00:04:09,771
Chanseong.

37
00:04:09,863 --> 00:04:11,256
Chanseong.

38
00:04:12,301 --> 00:04:14,264
Chanseong, are you all right?

39
00:04:14,374 --> 00:04:15,653
Open your eyes!

40
00:04:15,732 --> 00:04:17,316
Chanseong!

41
00:04:19,823 --> 00:04:21,067
Chanseong.

42
00:04:21,175 --> 00:04:23,079
Can you see me?

43
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,548
Hyung...

44
00:04:34,637 --> 00:04:36,793
Don't talk.

45
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:42,123
Chanseong...

46
00:05:51,067 --> 00:05:54,564
- Congressman Oh Byeongtak
Dies in Car Accident -

47
00:07:24,746 --> 00:07:26,647
You really want to run an orchard?

48
00:07:26,852 --> 00:07:29,016
That would be the plan, I guess.

49
00:07:29,566 --> 00:07:32,053
But I don't really know
how much that would cost me.

50
00:07:32,784 --> 00:07:35,724
And would you happen to have
a job for me, if I came there?

51
00:07:36,569 --> 00:07:38,020
Why, want to quit as well?

52
00:07:38,118 --> 00:07:40,696
Honestly, I've had
it with all this myself.

53
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:42,702
So hand your resignation
and come right away.

54
00:07:43,017 --> 00:07:45,381
You can always raise pigs next to me.

55
00:07:47,273 --> 00:07:49,911
I really will!

56
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,081
Goodbye.

57
00:08:26,126 --> 00:08:28,662
Goodbye, Chanseong...

58
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,297
Chanseong was murdered.

59
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:02,035
In his last call to me, he
mentioned the name Jo Pilyeon.

60
00:09:03,464 --> 00:09:05,216
There is no doubt, Gangmo.

61
00:09:05,322 --> 00:09:07,047
It was Jo Pilyeon.

62
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:12,402
He was the one who killed
Chanseong and Congressman Oh.

63
00:09:12,515 --> 00:09:14,587
If what you say is right,

64
00:09:14,842 --> 00:09:16,418
then they shouldn't
have cremated their bodies.

65
00:09:16,504 --> 00:09:23,382
All this was a stratagem by
Jo Pilyeon to avoid any autopsy.

66
00:09:38,515 --> 00:09:41,310
Congressman Oh Byeongtak wrote it.

67
00:09:42,317 --> 00:09:43,260
Hyung, this...

68
00:09:43,357 --> 00:09:45,995
He wrote in detail about
the connection between...

69
00:09:46,745 --> 00:09:50,915
Manbo Construction, Jo Pilyeon
and the private lending cartel.

70
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:30,741
According to reports
written by that Ji Yeonsoo,

71
00:10:30,866 --> 00:10:34,298
the report Yoo Chanseong
wrote dealt with the torture case.

72
00:10:34,408 --> 00:10:39,679
And the Catholic Priests' Association
for Justice got their hands on it.

73
00:10:39,881 --> 00:10:43,535
While Hwang Taeseop played the messenger.

74
00:10:43,692 --> 00:10:46,793
- That's what we can speculate.
- Arrest and put the squeeze on him.

75
00:10:46,892 --> 00:10:47,861
That's the quickest way.

76
00:10:47,951 --> 00:10:50,203
We can't do that anymore.

77
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:52,894
If we arrest someone without evidence,
we'll only get into trouble.

78
00:10:52,971 --> 00:10:57,368
You know how much the president
agonized over that torture case?

79
00:10:57,526 --> 00:10:58,385
Go take a look on the street.

80
00:10:58,443 --> 00:11:01,004
Seditious individuals are about to riot.

81
00:11:01,084 --> 00:11:05,893
I see we got a little cocky
ever since Congressman Oh died.

82
00:11:06,107 --> 00:11:07,111
What do you mean by that?

83
00:11:07,239 --> 00:11:11,052
Be honest, didn't that benefit you?

84
00:11:12,197 --> 00:11:16,065
And it will become the opportunity
of a lifetime for you as well.

85
00:11:16,252 --> 00:11:21,513
I know how to draw a line
between allies and foes.

86
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:35,520
Seongmo.

87
00:11:38,056 --> 00:11:42,349
Don't you think you're
neglecting me a little these days?

88
00:11:42,698 --> 00:11:45,808
A colleague of mine passed away,
so I couldn't spare the time.

89
00:11:45,994 --> 00:11:51,797
Yoo Chanseong was actually
bearing a grudge against me.

90
00:11:52,298 --> 00:11:56,826
All that has happened to us at
the ANSP was plotted by him.

91
00:11:57,514 --> 00:12:01,987
And you were unfairly
accused because of him.

92
00:12:03,202 --> 00:12:04,736
I see.

93
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:09,966
Is that the reason
why you killed Chanseong?

94
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,513
- Hey... Seongmo!
- I was just asking.

95
00:12:14,709 --> 00:12:19,274
Because if Yoo Chanseong was
indeed a traitor, he had it coming.

96
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:23,973
Well said.
He deserved to die.

97
00:12:25,964 --> 00:12:27,454
But...

98
00:12:28,443 --> 00:12:30,787
It's too bad that he died in an accident...

99
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:33,988
before I could deal with him firsthand.

100
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:43,180
Come by my house one of these evenings.

101
00:12:43,753 --> 00:12:50,316
My wife is really
disappointed that you never visit.

102
00:13:05,813 --> 00:13:11,001
Do you still suspect
Seongmo, by any chance?

103
00:13:11,273 --> 00:13:15,199
He lied to me twice.

104
00:13:15,357 --> 00:13:17,107
What are you trying to say?

105
00:13:17,334 --> 00:13:21,364
First he told me Lee Gangmo
died at the Samcheong camp,

106
00:13:21,575 --> 00:13:24,728
and then he lied about
that Miju getting an abortion.

107
00:13:24,857 --> 00:13:29,006
Yes... Now that I think
about it, it's strange.

108
00:13:29,106 --> 00:13:34,029
If Yoo Chanseong was the
one who leaked the account,

109
00:13:34,387 --> 00:13:38,413
then there is no doubt
that Lee Seongmo wrote it.

110
00:13:39,431 --> 00:13:41,336
So don't you ever let your guard down.

111
00:13:41,441 --> 00:13:43,329
All right, Congressman.

112
00:13:44,461 --> 00:13:49,075
So this has something to
do with Congressman Oh's death?

113
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:52,084
The corrupt connections
involving Jo Pilyeon are two.

114
00:13:52,815 --> 00:13:54,778
With a certain Noh Gapsoo
and his private lending operation,

115
00:13:54,864 --> 00:13:57,654
and Manbo Construction.

116
00:13:58,346 --> 00:14:03,115
Congressman Oh tried to bring
an end to Jo's political career by revealing that.

117
00:14:04,161 --> 00:14:07,878
There is no doubt that this
would be a formidable scoop,

118
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:11,397
but the fact we're dealing
with Jo Pilyeon bothers me.

119
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:15,633
Because of press guidelines
they are forcing on us,

120
00:14:15,777 --> 00:14:19,173
every article has to go through
an examination before it can be published.

121
00:14:19,502 --> 00:14:23,228
Then, is there no way
to publish that article?

122
00:14:25,492 --> 00:14:28,384
Congressman Oh's death
wasn't a simple car accident.

123
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:30,406
It was a first degree murder
plotted by a partnership...

124
00:14:30,507 --> 00:14:32,672
between corrupt
politicians and the underworld.

125
00:14:33,962 --> 00:14:37,874
There might be a way after all...

126
00:14:40,252 --> 00:14:44,623
We'd go straight to printing
without passing through the editor's room.

127
00:14:46,213 --> 00:14:48,083
Is that possible?

128
00:14:50,601 --> 00:14:53,499
Reporter Yoon,
what are you doing here?

129
00:14:53,814 --> 00:14:55,333
I came to see you, what else?

130
00:14:55,434 --> 00:14:57,182
It's going to take some
money to convince me?!

131
00:14:57,268 --> 00:15:00,005
At least a nice bottle of makgeolli...

132
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:01,765
Let's go, that will be my pleasure.

133
00:15:01,953 --> 00:15:03,982
But, this fella?

134
00:15:04,219 --> 00:15:06,068
Allow me to introduce myself.

135
00:15:08,905 --> 00:15:10,338
I'm Lee Gangmo.

136
00:15:11,298 --> 00:15:13,278
Ahh... You're a president?!

137
00:15:13,388 --> 00:15:16,758
I suddenly feel the
urge to eat samgyeopsal?!

138
00:15:16,853 --> 00:15:20,653
Here... We'll go for makgeolli
and samgyeopsal, then.

139
00:15:22,387 --> 00:15:23,519
What are you saying?

140
00:15:23,619 --> 00:15:28,075
So you want to change that
article and publish it that way?

141
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,084
Here you go.

142
00:15:34,494 --> 00:15:36,603
- The Menage a Trois between Congressman
Jo Pilyeon, Private Lending and Manbo Construction -

143
00:15:44,057 --> 00:15:48,554
Seeing this, looks like you're
trying to scold a few bad apples...

144
00:15:48,661 --> 00:15:50,373
We're counting on you.

145
00:15:50,803 --> 00:15:54,108
I have three kids in college.

146
00:15:54,294 --> 00:15:58,815
Of course two of them were imprisoned
after joining the demonstrations,

147
00:15:58,994 --> 00:16:02,590
but if I publish this and get fired,

148
00:16:02,763 --> 00:16:06,001
how is my family going to survive?

149
00:16:06,116 --> 00:16:10,827
- Mister Park.
- How many years left until you retire?

150
00:16:10,938 --> 00:16:12,876
I'm about there?!

151
00:16:12,991 --> 00:16:14,244
But, why are you asking?

152
00:16:14,338 --> 00:16:16,057
If you end up getting fired,

153
00:16:16,215 --> 00:16:19,124
Hangang Construction will scout you.

154
00:16:19,324 --> 00:16:20,750
S....cout?!

155
00:16:20,848 --> 00:16:22,969
We also will pay you
double your current salary.

156
00:16:23,141 --> 00:16:27,081
And of course we'll employ you for
much longer than your retirement age.

157
00:16:32,798 --> 00:16:34,002
Let's suppose I do it,

158
00:16:34,102 --> 00:16:36,853
but how about you?

159
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,563
You'd be fired even
before they worry about me?!

160
00:16:41,366 --> 00:16:42,641
I...

161
00:16:43,615 --> 00:16:46,176
have already written
my letter of resignation.

162
00:16:46,309 --> 00:16:47,900
Seonsaengnim.

163
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,479
Don't worry, Gangmo.

164
00:16:50,722 --> 00:16:54,760
A few other dismissed reporters have
started a monthly current affairs magazine,

165
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:57,402
so I can just join them.

166
00:16:58,921 --> 00:17:02,173
I need to go back to work,
so let's have another drink and leave.

167
00:17:02,259 --> 00:17:04,394
Yes, sure.

168
00:17:33,449 --> 00:17:36,916
- The Menage a Trois between Congressman
Jo Pilyeon, Private Lending and Manbo Construction -

169
00:17:53,691 --> 00:18:00,754
- The Menage a Trois between Congressman
Jo Pilyeon, Private Lending and Manbo Construction -

170
00:18:13,048 --> 00:18:14,679
Yes, Chairman.

171
00:18:14,868 --> 00:18:16,217
Have you seen the paper?

172
00:18:16,413 --> 00:18:17,249
What?

173
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:18,499
The paper?

174
00:18:18,634 --> 00:18:20,476
Gather all the top executives
for an emergency meeting.

175
00:18:20,574 --> 00:18:22,045
Right now.

176
00:18:28,163 --> 00:18:31,299
Who the hell published this?

177
00:18:31,414 --> 00:18:35,000
That article was written
by a certain Yoon Gihoon.

178
00:18:35,113 --> 00:18:36,967
Yoon Gihoon?!

179
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:41,831
That Reporter Yoon was
Lee Gangmo's middle school teacher.

180
00:18:42,017 --> 00:18:46,750
Then, are you telling me
that Lee Gangmo is behind this?

181
00:18:46,926 --> 00:18:48,516
According to our
investigation, that's right.

182
00:18:48,631 --> 00:18:52,878
Arrest him immediately
and question him... Right now!!

183
00:18:52,988 --> 00:18:56,612
The entire country
has set its sights on this!

184
00:18:56,798 --> 00:18:59,167
How can we avoid all
those arrows coming our way?

185
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,534
So? Are you just going
to let him walk free?

186
00:19:02,628 --> 00:19:05,203
It's already spilt milk.

187
00:19:05,446 --> 00:19:09,415
Shouldn't you worry
about putting off your own fire?

188
00:19:14,201 --> 00:19:15,491
Yes.

189
00:19:16,694 --> 00:19:18,170
Yes, Sir.

190
00:19:19,187 --> 00:19:20,588
I will, Sir.

191
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,580
Yes, Sir.

192
00:19:24,241 --> 00:19:25,947
Who called?

193
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:30,231
The Blue House summoned you.

194
00:19:40,315 --> 00:19:42,737
I am mortified, Mister President.

195
00:19:47,107 --> 00:19:49,413
Now they even call
you to a meeting like this...

196
00:19:49,615 --> 00:19:53,781
I see joining Congressman
Noh's camp helped your career.

197
00:19:54,013 --> 00:19:57,237
He's soon going to announce
his candidacy for the next elections.

198
00:19:57,448 --> 00:19:59,260
As if I wasn't busy enough already,

199
00:19:59,472 --> 00:20:02,710
now I even have to deal
with your dirty laundry.

200
00:20:03,226 --> 00:20:06,100
Are we getting sarcastic?

201
00:20:08,754 --> 00:20:13,999
Congressman Oh was my political mentor.

202
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,125
And I plan to get to the bottom of this.

203
00:20:18,269 --> 00:20:21,149
Have you forgotten that the president
just asked us to handle this quietly?

204
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:26,582
If you end up having the
slightest involvement in that case,

205
00:20:26,717 --> 00:20:31,267
I'm sure the president is
not going to forgive you.

206
00:20:43,263 --> 00:20:47,805
Give us a comment on
Congressman Jo's suspected connections.

207
00:20:47,934 --> 00:20:49,968
Did you see the list of ailing
companies before it was published?

208
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,493
And how do you feel about the insinuations
of politics and finance as corrupt bedfellows?

209
00:20:53,565 --> 00:20:55,753
I'm sorry, please free the way.

210
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:08,473
Several shareholders are
requesting a meeting with you.

211
00:21:08,631 --> 00:21:10,059
Send them back.

212
00:21:10,264 --> 00:21:11,224
What?

213
00:21:11,709 --> 00:21:15,953
But, you should at least
say something to reassure them...

214
00:21:16,366 --> 00:21:19,355
Other than finding a solution,
why should I waste time on any of that?

215
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:21,467
All right, Chairman.

216
00:21:39,744 --> 00:21:41,741
Ahh.... Thank you.

217
00:21:41,881 --> 00:21:43,818
Thank you.

218
00:21:44,379 --> 00:21:45,704
How about it? Does it look good?

219
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:48,496
Wow... Miss Cha is really great?!

220
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:51,350
I think we'll have really cool ads.

221
00:21:51,822 --> 00:21:53,471
Oppa.

222
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:56,422
Good job.

223
00:21:56,938 --> 00:21:58,153
When is the shoot for the commercial?

224
00:21:58,264 --> 00:21:59,330
This Friday.

225
00:21:59,402 --> 00:22:01,892
Once the newspaper ad
and the commercial are out,

226
00:22:02,021 --> 00:22:03,956
we've got this sale covered.

227
00:22:04,171 --> 00:22:06,094
I'll be there to promote the sale as well.

228
00:22:06,263 --> 00:22:07,153
Really?

229
00:22:07,262 --> 00:22:09,974
If you can do that for us,
we'll just hit the jackpot!

230
00:22:10,088 --> 00:22:12,383
Of course.
It's Cha Soojeong, after all.

231
00:22:15,161 --> 00:22:16,500
Yes...

232
00:22:16,737 --> 00:22:21,490
Anyhow, leave no stone unturned
and thoroughly investigate everything.

233
00:22:22,755 --> 00:22:24,188
Yes.

234
00:22:24,475 --> 00:22:25,765
Yes.

235
00:22:26,495 --> 00:22:28,243
Come on in, Chief Lee.

236
00:22:28,329 --> 00:22:30,116
I see you're busy.

237
00:22:31,023 --> 00:22:35,722
Manbo Construction is soon going
to be hit with a massive tax audit.

238
00:22:36,467 --> 00:22:39,003
Have anything that could
help us, by any chance?

239
00:22:39,132 --> 00:22:41,281
Nothing concrete.

240
00:22:41,912 --> 00:22:44,568
It's not going to be easy,
if Jo Pilyeon is the target.

241
00:22:44,806 --> 00:22:46,605
He's not the type to
leave any evidence behind.

242
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:48,878
How about the prosecutors' side?

243
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:51,171
I've already hit that route.

244
00:22:51,357 --> 00:22:53,220
He will soon be summoned.

245
00:22:53,406 --> 00:22:55,957
They won't be able to
get much out of him, either.

246
00:22:56,544 --> 00:22:58,979
They'll stop at mere formalities.

247
00:22:59,209 --> 00:23:02,548
And that is why we
need stronger evidence.

248
00:23:02,677 --> 00:23:08,027
Would you be able to allow
the ANSP to investigate on him?

249
00:23:08,242 --> 00:23:11,409
You mean letting you
take over the investigation?

250
00:23:11,595 --> 00:23:16,043
Because I'm the only one who
knows Jo Pilyeon well enough to do it.

251
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:20,349
You do have a point.

252
00:23:20,967 --> 00:23:23,475
I will bring it up with Director Kim.

253
00:23:23,689 --> 00:23:26,183
Thank you, Congressman Min.

254
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:33,640
Who are you people?

255
00:23:33,738 --> 00:23:36,278
What are you doing here?

256
00:23:37,095 --> 00:23:38,352
Look!

257
00:23:38,465 --> 00:23:40,176
Hey!

258
00:23:42,726 --> 00:23:43,586
What is going on?

259
00:23:43,715 --> 00:23:45,664
We're from the National Tax Service.

260
00:23:46,108 --> 00:23:47,899
Proceed.

261
00:24:06,892 --> 00:24:08,446
Who are you people?

262
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:10,524
We come from the ANSP.

263
00:24:11,384 --> 00:24:12,847
The ANSP?!

264
00:24:13,046 --> 00:24:15,682
So not the prosecutor's
office, but you are here?

265
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,921
You'll have to forgive me,
but I must ask you to follow us.

266
00:24:19,637 --> 00:24:21,517
Chief Oh is smarter than I thought.

267
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:25,651
I was just thinking that
this would be much better for me.

268
00:24:25,761 --> 00:24:30,948
- Jaechun, give Chief Oh a call.
- All right, Congressman.

269
00:24:35,289 --> 00:24:36,604
Yeah...

270
00:24:39,932 --> 00:24:41,744
All right.

271
00:24:43,162 --> 00:24:44,409
Sure.

272
00:24:51,258 --> 00:24:55,328
Director Kim told me he hopes
that there are no seedy connections...

273
00:24:55,457 --> 00:24:58,603
between you and Jo Pilyeon.

274
00:25:01,053 --> 00:25:04,435
You can take a short leave
of absence if you want, Chief Oh.

275
00:25:15,622 --> 00:25:18,688
Seongmo, you came out to see me?

276
00:25:24,563 --> 00:25:25,394
What is this?

277
00:25:25,552 --> 00:25:27,099
I'm sorry.

278
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:30,663
I'm forced to
follow my superior's orders.

279
00:26:15,121 --> 00:26:17,280
Where did Chief Oh go?

280
00:26:17,524 --> 00:26:19,551
He's away on an assignment in the provinces.

281
00:26:19,687 --> 00:26:21,106
Who did this?

282
00:26:21,471 --> 00:26:23,456
Director Kim?

283
00:26:24,273 --> 00:26:26,302
Who ordered you to arrest me?

284
00:26:26,428 --> 00:26:29,116
There are plenty of eyes on us.

285
00:26:29,932 --> 00:26:33,345
If you don't collaborate,
this might take long.

286
00:26:34,018 --> 00:26:35,661
Lee Seongmo.

287
00:26:35,881 --> 00:26:38,116
Now you're starting as well?

288
00:26:40,567 --> 00:26:47,287
Don't tell me you're suspecting
that I killed Yoo Chanseong?!

289
00:26:50,722 --> 00:26:54,892
I once heard this from you.

290
00:26:56,755 --> 00:26:59,334
That suspecting someone
with the intent of saving him...

291
00:26:59,921 --> 00:27:03,389
or just to kill him are
two entirely different things.

292
00:27:05,487 --> 00:27:07,450
But what I see in your eyes...

293
00:27:08,671 --> 00:27:12,408
is nothing but suspicion with
the intent of killing someone?!

294
00:27:15,531 --> 00:27:17,050
I'm surely...

295
00:27:18,082 --> 00:27:21,285
seeing wrong, isn't it?!

296
00:27:24,223 --> 00:27:26,200
I will start.

297
00:27:30,513 --> 00:27:38,235
You once told me that Yoo Chanseong
was bearing a grudge against you.

298
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:43,537
Explain why he would bear
such feelings against you.

299
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:48,262
Seongmo, I thought you were clever.

300
00:27:48,437 --> 00:27:51,389
- Guess I was wrong.
- Please answer.

301
00:27:51,905 --> 00:27:59,333
Be it intentional or not,
you're making a big mistake.

302
00:28:00,808 --> 00:28:02,755
I'll ask again.

303
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:09,625
Is it true that you killed
Yoo Chanseong's older brother?

304
00:28:15,886 --> 00:28:17,477
Right...

305
00:28:19,354 --> 00:28:24,011
Why would I blame
it on someone like you?

306
00:28:25,405 --> 00:28:31,695
Only one man is capable of
plotting something like this against me.

307
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:37,284
Min Honggi!

308
00:28:37,714 --> 00:28:42,679
Stop forcing Seongmo to do
your dirty work and come forward.

309
00:28:44,456 --> 00:28:46,562
This is not going
to kill me, I'm afraid.

310
00:28:46,734 --> 00:28:48,805
The moment I get out of this room,

311
00:28:48,998 --> 00:28:55,260
you'll find out firsthand
how big a mistake all this was.

312
00:28:58,926 --> 00:29:03,053
I'll take responsibility,
so let's go all the way.

313
00:29:05,016 --> 00:29:07,538
Is that true?

314
00:29:07,782 --> 00:29:13,119
An impregnable fortress like Jo
Pilyeon was arrested by the ANSP?!

315
00:29:13,231 --> 00:29:16,506
Congressman Min Honggi
was convinced that...

316
00:29:16,621 --> 00:29:20,432
Jo Pilyeon was behind Congressman Oh's death.

317
00:29:21,564 --> 00:29:24,530
He joined Congressman Noh's camp,

318
00:29:24,745 --> 00:29:27,925
and now he's firing on all cylinders.

319
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:30,644
Well... Since barring any last minute change,

320
00:29:30,715 --> 00:29:33,681
Congressman Noh is going
to become the next president.

321
00:29:33,853 --> 00:29:38,066
Then, does it mean that Jo
Pilyeon's political career is over?

322
00:29:38,224 --> 00:29:40,215
Timing is the problem.

323
00:29:40,856 --> 00:29:42,594
No matter if it's Congressman Min,

324
00:29:42,866 --> 00:29:45,026
he won't be able to hold
Jo Pilyeon for much longer.

325
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:51,818
If he doesn't find any concrete evidence,
all this will have been in vain...

326
00:30:04,118 --> 00:30:05,485
What's wrong with you?

327
00:30:05,622 --> 00:30:06,775
Uh?!

328
00:30:06,926 --> 00:30:09,147
I'm a colleague of yours.

329
00:30:09,348 --> 00:30:12,578
Aren't you taking this too far?

330
00:30:31,321 --> 00:30:33,702
Hey... Seongmo!

331
00:30:33,917 --> 00:30:36,410
What were you waiting for, man...

332
00:30:36,662 --> 00:30:40,136
Take all these off of me.

333
00:30:42,744 --> 00:30:43,858
Go Seonbae.

334
00:30:44,033 --> 00:30:46,039
Yeah, Seongmo.

335
00:30:46,297 --> 00:30:50,332
How many people
have you killed so far?

336
00:30:51,924 --> 00:30:56,724
Did anyone instigate you to
commit these last two murders?

337
00:30:56,925 --> 00:30:59,389
Or did you order someone else to do it?

338
00:31:03,989 --> 00:31:06,713
The congressman was right...

339
00:31:07,582 --> 00:31:12,064
I still wanted to believe
you to the very end...

340
00:31:12,171 --> 00:31:13,588
Answer my question.

341
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,511
The congressman!

342
00:31:17,288 --> 00:31:19,981
Always treated you like a son.

343
00:31:21,357 --> 00:31:23,463
Why did you do it?

344
00:31:24,151 --> 00:31:24,977
Why?

345
00:31:25,069 --> 00:31:27,117
What is the reason?

346
00:31:44,164 --> 00:31:45,783
Chief!

347
00:31:46,356 --> 00:31:48,477
Chief! You're going to kill him!

348
00:31:48,591 --> 00:31:50,280
Out of the way.

349
00:31:52,483 --> 00:31:53,852
Chief!!

350
00:31:54,024 --> 00:31:57,348
My mother died because of you.

351
00:31:57,799 --> 00:32:02,034
I've been waiting for
this day ever since, Go Jaechun...

352
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:04,320
Chief!

353
00:32:19,903 --> 00:32:25,768
- My Home, The Most Comfortable Place on Earth -
Hangang Construction

354
00:32:29,411 --> 00:32:30,856
The moment the sale was opened,

355
00:32:30,945 --> 00:32:35,348
hordes of people filed applications
for Hangang Construction's apartments.

356
00:32:36,504 --> 00:32:40,524
I think we should follow
suit before it's too late.

357
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:44,167
You only start a fight when
you're 100 percent sure to win it.

358
00:32:44,564 --> 00:32:46,311
And now is not the time.

359
00:32:46,426 --> 00:32:50,514
- Still, just sitting back and watching...
- Just wait.

360
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:54,011
I'm thinking of a counterplan as we speak.

361
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:03,259
Watch the line, folks.

362
00:33:05,045 --> 00:33:08,248
Soojeong's help made a big difference.

363
00:33:08,684 --> 00:33:12,353
Hey... We'll have to
open another sales office.

364
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,799
Do that.

365
00:33:13,924 --> 00:33:17,215
- Shideok, look into it.
- All right.

366
00:33:17,371 --> 00:33:21,271
But we're so damn busy, why are
those two not coming back from the UK?

367
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:25,982
Hey... The way I see it,
Sotae made a move on her.

368
00:33:26,077 --> 00:33:30,476
I knew it the moment I
saw how he was staring at Gyeongja.

369
00:33:30,587 --> 00:33:32,776
What is that supposed to mean?

370
00:33:32,864 --> 00:33:35,985
Shouldn't his brother-in-law know better?!

371
00:33:36,085 --> 00:33:38,750
Don't even say that!

372
00:33:48,196 --> 00:33:49,830
Thank you.

373
00:34:12,531 --> 00:34:13,921
Yes.

374
00:34:16,142 --> 00:34:18,151
What's the matter, Mom?

375
00:34:19,044 --> 00:34:21,079
What on earth are you saying?

376
00:34:21,265 --> 00:34:23,553
Dad was arrested by the ANSP?!

377
00:34:27,297 --> 00:34:29,945
I'll look into it,
so don't worry too much.

378
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:32,144
All right, I get it!

379
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:35,262
What happened, Chairman?

380
00:34:43,085 --> 00:34:44,529
Chief...

381
00:34:44,747 --> 00:34:47,154
Aren't you having lunch?

382
00:34:49,934 --> 00:34:52,344
You didn't even eat breakfast...

383
00:34:52,438 --> 00:34:55,379
Should I go out
and buy you something?

384
00:35:09,496 --> 00:35:10,456
Yes.

385
00:35:10,771 --> 00:35:12,001
It's me, Hyung.

386
00:35:12,204 --> 00:35:14,282
What's going on with my father?

387
00:35:16,101 --> 00:35:17,423
It's nothing serious.

388
00:35:17,635 --> 00:35:20,128
Just a formality.

389
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,049
All right.

390
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:24,915
No need to worry.

391
00:35:25,345 --> 00:35:27,823
Still, I'm glad you're there.

392
00:35:28,941 --> 00:35:30,113
Need to go.

393
00:35:30,403 --> 00:35:31,964
I'm busy now.

394
00:35:40,163 --> 00:35:42,779
I've gathered all executives.

395
00:35:49,133 --> 00:35:52,887
Starting now, we're going to
accept applications for our apartments.

396
00:35:53,102 --> 00:35:55,300
As you're well aware,
Hangang Construction is...

397
00:35:55,416 --> 00:35:59,846
performing much better than
us in the Suseo apartment sale.

398
00:36:00,026 --> 00:36:05,094
So to turn the tide in our favor,
we will follow a new strategy.

399
00:36:05,328 --> 00:36:06,732
First,

400
00:36:07,377 --> 00:36:11,048
we will focus on upscale
buyers with higher prices.

401
00:36:11,378 --> 00:36:15,513
This will not only show that the
rumors about us are unfounded,

402
00:36:15,676 --> 00:36:19,989
but also help us differentiate
our offer from that of our competitor.

403
00:36:21,021 --> 00:36:25,048
During sales season, you often
see "birds of passage" trying to get their fill,

404
00:36:25,277 --> 00:36:28,663
real estate speculators
trying to drive up prices.

405
00:36:29,422 --> 00:36:33,387
We could use those middlemen
to spread rumors about...

406
00:36:33,527 --> 00:36:37,991
the price of our apartments going up
threefold a few years after buying them.

407
00:36:38,161 --> 00:36:43,096
Encouraging real estate speculation is
the best form of marketing we can undertake.

408
00:36:45,059 --> 00:36:49,143
We will hire a few hundred people
to stand in line at our sales offices,

409
00:36:49,358 --> 00:36:54,516
to make people buy into the idea
that our apartments are selling really well.

410
00:36:56,938 --> 00:37:01,744
And using TV exposure to our
advantage is another must.

411
00:37:02,268 --> 00:37:05,197
All right then, let's join forces.

412
00:37:05,269 --> 00:37:08,416
There's nothing as effective as TV...

413
00:37:08,539 --> 00:37:12,648
in convincing the same banking sector
which has been ignoring us.

414
00:37:13,968 --> 00:37:15,725
The bank is giving anyone
who applies for their apartments...

415
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:18,490
loans at very low interest rates.

416
00:37:18,576 --> 00:37:21,141
{\a6}- Manbo's Suseo Sale About to Reach the 60 Percent -

417
00:37:20,324 --> 00:37:21,901
According to our investigation,

418
00:37:22,058 --> 00:37:23,811
it seems like they're
using real estate speculators.

419
00:37:23,921 --> 00:37:24,921
Speculators?

420
00:37:25,029 --> 00:37:27,213
Aren't they manipulating the market, then?

421
00:37:27,307 --> 00:37:29,383
Should we go at it as well?

422
00:37:29,483 --> 00:37:31,027
No.

423
00:37:31,271 --> 00:37:34,982
No need to give people the image
that we're wrestling against each other.

424
00:37:35,254 --> 00:37:38,894
We'll just go at it our own way.

425
00:37:41,215 --> 00:37:42,677
How about the CF shoot?

426
00:37:42,831 --> 00:37:43,925
You saw, right?

427
00:37:44,032 --> 00:37:46,110
It was just awesome.

428
00:37:46,282 --> 00:37:48,277
They're going to start
airing it from next week.

429
00:37:48,369 --> 00:37:51,053
Spare no expense
and market it aggressively.

430
00:37:51,147 --> 00:37:54,177
- Yes, we will, President!
- Yes, Sir!

431
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:10,865
I think Jo Pilyeon
will have to be released.

432
00:38:11,104 --> 00:38:12,842
The investigation is not over yet.

433
00:38:12,942 --> 00:38:15,464
He'll be released in the afternoon.

434
00:38:18,272 --> 00:38:20,787
Asking Director Kim will be useless,

435
00:38:21,038 --> 00:38:24,376
since there have been
complaints from political circles.

436
00:38:26,196 --> 00:38:29,469
I feel just like you,
but what else can we do?

437
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:32,372
We'll have to find another way.

438
00:38:33,418 --> 00:38:38,183
I'm sure Jo Pilyeon
will resent you for this.

439
00:38:38,685 --> 00:38:40,247
Be careful out there.

440
00:38:54,836 --> 00:38:56,455
Chairman.

441
00:38:58,992 --> 00:39:00,840
Dad.

442
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:26,583
So even Seongmo
Hyung couldn't expose him.

443
00:39:30,437 --> 00:39:32,984
First, we'll have to go to the hospital.

444
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:35,921
I'm... just fine, Congressman.

445
00:39:36,111 --> 00:39:39,919
Who the hell did this to you?

446
00:39:40,506 --> 00:39:42,609
Lee Seongmo...

447
00:39:43,644 --> 00:39:46,228
Are you telling me Lee
Seongmo personally tortured you?

448
00:39:46,323 --> 00:39:51,296
It was as if he wanted to kill me.

449
00:39:52,095 --> 00:39:55,405
Even if still upset over
Yoo Chanseong's death,

450
00:39:55,636 --> 00:39:57,446
there is no way he
would do something like this.

451
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,632
I may not know the reason,

452
00:40:00,206 --> 00:40:02,813
but this is betrayal for sure.

453
00:40:03,031 --> 00:40:05,163
I'm sure he had his reasons.

454
00:40:05,751 --> 00:40:08,559
If it was for your sake,

455
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:11,048
Seongmo Hyung would do anything.

456
00:40:11,915 --> 00:40:15,290
I don't really like the fact you're
suspecting him without a single hesitation.

457
00:40:15,433 --> 00:40:17,697
There are things you don't know.

458
00:40:18,645 --> 00:40:23,013
We must find his true colors at all cost.

459
00:40:34,311 --> 00:40:36,336
Leave me alone a moment.

460
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:37,736
Uh?

461
00:40:37,927 --> 00:40:39,970
I said get the hell out!

462
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:42,201
Y...es, Chief.

463
00:41:18,219 --> 00:41:22,074
- 0830, Chief Lee Seongmo Arrives at the Office
- 0915, Morning Meeting (Director's Office)
- 1100, 2nd Division Meeting (Torture Case)

464
00:41:42,052 --> 00:41:42,883
Open this.

465
00:41:42,998 --> 00:41:45,935
- What?
- Hurry up and open it!

466
00:42:02,815 --> 00:42:04,070
- Ji Yeonsoo Files -

467
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,835
- 1000, Chief Yoo Chanseong
Interrogates Student Demonstrator -

468
00:42:13,428 --> 00:42:17,082
- 1000, Chief Yoo Chanseong Writes
Report (Namyoung-Dong Torture Case)

469
00:42:18,487 --> 00:42:20,598
What's the matter, Chief?

470
00:42:20,702 --> 00:42:22,855
Who's in charge of examining
the new recruits' reports?

471
00:42:22,946 --> 00:42:26,068
These days, Chief Yoon does it.

472
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:51,138
I knew this would happen.

473
00:42:51,475 --> 00:42:54,413
You like your new phone?

474
00:43:02,566 --> 00:43:04,801
What's the matter?

475
00:43:05,002 --> 00:43:08,491
You don't like the phone?

476
00:43:32,658 --> 00:43:35,108
How could I possibly blame it on you?!

477
00:43:36,226 --> 00:43:38,777
Like you'd know what was going on...

478
00:43:40,010 --> 00:43:42,202
Chief...

479
00:44:02,803 --> 00:44:05,379
- Isn't that Cha Soojeong?
- It's her, Eonni!

480
00:44:05,908 --> 00:44:09,149
- Cha Soojeong, how are you?
- Hi.

481
00:44:09,278 --> 00:44:09,665
Hi.

482
00:44:09,737 --> 00:44:11,614
You're so pretty!

483
00:44:11,771 --> 00:44:12,617
Thank you.

484
00:44:12,674 --> 00:44:14,666
Will you sign this?

485
00:44:14,795 --> 00:44:17,976
I like your songs so much.

486
00:44:34,643 --> 00:44:36,315
What's with him?

487
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:39,377
He looked at you and just left?!

488
00:44:42,258 --> 00:44:45,453
Seonhwa, let's just go.

489
00:44:46,958 --> 00:44:48,893
Thank you.

490
00:45:07,123 --> 00:45:08,786
Birthday?!

491
00:45:15,282 --> 00:45:18,878
Do you know what giving a man
a necktie pin really means?

492
00:45:20,154 --> 00:45:22,332
The way I've heard it,

493
00:45:22,613 --> 00:45:26,573
it's what women give to men
when they confess to them?!

494
00:45:27,089 --> 00:45:28,107
Really?

495
00:45:28,216 --> 00:45:31,346
I just bought it without knowing?!

496
00:46:09,325 --> 00:46:11,302
Keep it for the rest of your days.

497
00:46:12,104 --> 00:46:13,982
If you ever take it off, you're dead.

498
00:46:42,519 --> 00:46:43,947
Gangmo!

499
00:46:44,152 --> 00:46:46,242
Are you still busy at this hour?

500
00:46:46,387 --> 00:46:47,878
Aren't you leaving?

501
00:46:48,234 --> 00:46:50,547
We're soon getting our permit,

502
00:46:50,783 --> 00:46:52,711
so I was checking data
for the last screening.

503
00:46:52,904 --> 00:46:55,147
Really?
Can I help you with anything?

504
00:46:55,369 --> 00:46:56,972
Nah...

505
00:46:57,475 --> 00:47:01,215
So, what should we start from?

506
00:47:06,642 --> 00:47:08,089
Here.

507
00:47:09,063 --> 00:47:11,098
See if the calculations are right.

508
00:47:11,327 --> 00:47:13,462
Okay.

509
00:47:17,317 --> 00:47:18,893
Jeongyeon.

510
00:47:19,968 --> 00:47:25,617
Later... In what kind of
house would you like to live?

511
00:47:26,089 --> 00:47:27,987
What kind of house?!

512
00:47:28,697 --> 00:47:30,230
Just...

513
00:47:30,546 --> 00:47:32,451
You know...

514
00:47:32,810 --> 00:47:36,263
The kind of house people in their
40s or 50s dream of, and stuff.

515
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:40,214
I really have no ideal house?

516
00:47:40,549 --> 00:47:42,034
Still...

517
00:47:42,779 --> 00:47:44,455
Tell me.

518
00:47:45,029 --> 00:47:47,221
Let's see...

519
00:47:47,556 --> 00:47:49,857
I never really thought about it...

520
00:47:50,330 --> 00:47:54,168
Ohh... I'd like to
have a really big dog.

521
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:55,664
A dog?

522
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:58,169
Yeah... A white one.

523
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:03,643
My stepmother hated dogs,
so I could never have one.

524
00:48:07,211 --> 00:48:10,717
If you want a big dog,
you'll also need a very large yard.

525
00:48:10,848 --> 00:48:12,231
Right?

526
00:48:12,396 --> 00:48:15,863
With large front doors...
and a tiny gate.

527
00:48:16,436 --> 00:48:17,712
What else?

528
00:48:19,632 --> 00:48:22,254
I'll want to play the
piano every now and then,

529
00:48:22,465 --> 00:48:24,590
so the living room
should be really wide.

530
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,999
Which color for the piano?

531
00:48:27,228 --> 00:48:30,207
White, of course.
A Grand piano.

532
00:48:30,391 --> 00:48:32,888
Ahh... Grand.

533
00:48:34,407 --> 00:48:37,431
I'd like very large windows, and...

534
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:38,727
Right.

535
00:48:38,935 --> 00:48:42,439
A terrace where I could drink
coffee in the morning would be nice, too.

536
00:48:42,531 --> 00:48:45,503
Right where the sun shines.

537
00:48:46,676 --> 00:48:49,143
As for the roof...

538
00:48:49,917 --> 00:48:52,095
Red would be nice.

539
00:48:52,297 --> 00:48:57,352
And I'd put roses all
across the fence. Lilacs, too.

540
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,765
That's my favorite sce....

541
00:49:04,264 --> 00:49:07,674
I really have no big expectations...

542
00:49:08,391 --> 00:49:13,019
So if you really want to take care of all that,

543
00:49:13,345 --> 00:49:16,655
I don't think you'll be able to live alone?

544
00:49:25,147 --> 00:49:26,394
Go back in.

545
00:49:26,571 --> 00:49:28,551
After I see you go.

546
00:49:28,749 --> 00:49:30,761
It's cold, just go.

547
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:33,627
Thanks for helping me, Gangmo.

548
00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:36,249
Drive safely.

549
00:49:36,593 --> 00:49:38,012
Right.

550
00:49:59,261 --> 00:50:01,615
Just wait, Jeongyeon.

551
00:50:01,944 --> 00:50:05,125
I'll build you that house for sure.

552
00:50:12,347 --> 00:50:13,551
Yes?

553
00:50:14,296 --> 00:50:15,499
Hyung.

554
00:50:27,351 --> 00:50:29,157
It's you?

555
00:50:33,149 --> 00:50:36,285
Why did you drink so much?

556
00:50:38,856 --> 00:50:42,103
Because if I don't,

557
00:50:43,393 --> 00:50:46,903
I might just go crazy.

558
00:50:47,734 --> 00:50:49,932
We still have a chance.

559
00:50:50,248 --> 00:50:52,684
Don't let anxiety
get the better of you, Hyung.

560
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,535
Gangmo.

561
00:50:57,126 --> 00:51:01,267
If... And that's just a if.

562
00:51:03,158 --> 00:51:10,824
If I ended up dying, you'd
still be living happily with Miju, right?

563
00:51:11,669 --> 00:51:12,979
What do you mean by that?

564
00:51:13,088 --> 00:51:15,767
I can't take this anymore.

565
00:51:17,209 --> 00:51:21,827
I just want to put a bullet through
Jo Pilyeon's head and kill myself.

566
00:51:22,099 --> 00:51:23,590
Get a hold of yourself, Hyung!

567
00:51:23,733 --> 00:51:25,914
I mean it, Gangmo.

568
00:51:27,487 --> 00:51:31,248
I might even kill that bastard tonight.

569
00:51:31,442 --> 00:51:33,752
Hyung, you're the head of our family!

570
00:51:33,949 --> 00:51:38,653
If you die like that, think our
parents will welcome you with open hands?

571
00:51:41,662 --> 00:51:44,585
Chanseong died because of me.

572
00:51:46,054 --> 00:51:49,142
While I was letting Jo Pilyeon fool me...

573
00:51:50,145 --> 00:51:53,101
While I was acting
so foolishly, I got him killed.

574
00:51:54,190 --> 00:51:55,959
Tell me what happened.

575
00:51:56,154 --> 00:52:02,773
Jo Pilyeon sent a spy to our office.

576
00:52:05,123 --> 00:52:06,786
Neither the killed...

577
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:10,080
nor the killer knew anything about it.

578
00:52:10,625 --> 00:52:13,447
Jo Pilyeon plotted
all that from the beginning.

579
00:52:13,731 --> 00:52:17,460
He made sure a colleague would kill him!

580
00:52:21,586 --> 00:52:23,521
It's my fault.

581
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:27,247
I let him fool me.

582
00:52:28,236 --> 00:52:31,761
He died because of me!

583
00:52:39,713 --> 00:52:41,673
I know, Hyung.

584
00:52:42,805 --> 00:52:44,740
I know what you're feeling.

585
00:52:45,254 --> 00:52:47,348
But revenge is all we need.

586
00:52:48,035 --> 00:52:50,973
We can just all join forces, Hyung.

587
00:52:53,953 --> 00:52:56,833
But don't you ever
tell me you'll die, Hyung.

588
00:52:57,292 --> 00:53:05,071
We need to find Junmo
and live together happily, Hyung.

589
00:53:30,463 --> 00:53:34,195
Did he have that much to drink?

590
00:53:36,187 --> 00:53:39,479
There's nothing wrong with him, right?

591
00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:41,402
No need to worry.

592
00:53:41,508 --> 00:53:44,483
Just prepare him some
hangover soup tomorrow.

593
00:53:45,834 --> 00:53:49,745
He should get married, so that
someone can take care of him.

594
00:54:14,127 --> 00:54:16,294
Are you feeling better, Hyung?

595
00:54:22,370 --> 00:54:24,304
Where am I?

596
00:54:25,293 --> 00:54:27,184
Miju's bedroom.

597
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:35,173
And how did I end up here?
I don't remember a thing.

598
00:54:37,343 --> 00:54:40,546
About that spy you
talked about yesterday.

599
00:54:42,323 --> 00:54:46,020
She still doesn't know she's
being used to spy on you, does she?

600
00:54:46,149 --> 00:54:47,897
She's a naive girl.

601
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:49,272
And kind.

602
00:54:49,373 --> 00:54:54,211
I think we might actually
use her to ruin Jo Pilyeon.

603
00:54:57,077 --> 00:55:03,740
Since all we need is proof
that he killed Oh Byeongtak.

604
00:55:10,190 --> 00:55:15,061
So now you've been cleared of
any suspicion of murder?

605
00:55:15,425 --> 00:55:19,499
They've got nothing on their hands,
what could they possibly do?

606
00:55:19,690 --> 00:55:23,286
I almost risked getting
involved in all this because of you.

607
00:55:23,501 --> 00:55:25,822
This was a good opportunity to learn.

608
00:55:26,094 --> 00:55:26,782
Better yet,

609
00:55:26,911 --> 00:55:30,608
to recall things I've been
forgetting for much too long.

610
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:35,780
The fact that offense is
the best form of defense.

611
00:55:36,024 --> 00:55:38,025
Who's the target?

612
00:55:38,487 --> 00:55:41,677
Min Honggi will be the first.

613
00:55:41,785 --> 00:55:43,345
And the second?

614
00:55:44,133 --> 00:55:45,063
That bastard...

615
00:55:45,250 --> 00:55:46,752
That is...

616
00:55:47,027 --> 00:55:49,322
The one who's been going at
my throat from behind my back.

617
00:55:49,413 --> 00:55:53,189
Yoo Chanseong is already dead,

618
00:55:53,948 --> 00:55:55,985
so is it still Lee Seongmo?

619
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:03,307
So, what kind of offense
are you going to start with?

620
00:56:05,743 --> 00:56:07,835
No need to hesitate any longer.

621
00:56:08,071 --> 00:56:11,520
If we put the squeeze on Hwang
Taeseop, everything will be solved.

622
00:56:14,185 --> 00:56:15,904
Think about it.

623
00:56:16,263 --> 00:56:20,177
Min Honggi might have been
benefiting from his connections,

624
00:56:20,375 --> 00:56:23,381
but he was a sympathizer of
the amendment just a few months ago.

625
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:25,325
That's just an allegation.

626
00:56:25,438 --> 00:56:30,548
Isn't that the reason why we
should catch Hwang Taeseop?

627
00:56:31,235 --> 00:56:34,674
He holds all the keys.

628
00:56:35,104 --> 00:56:37,553
All we need is for him to speak.

629
00:56:37,755 --> 00:56:39,175
I see...

630
00:56:39,374 --> 00:56:41,424
Same goes for Lee Seongmo.

631
00:56:41,624 --> 00:56:45,186
If the man who got in touch with
Yoo Chanseong is Hwang Taeseop,

632
00:56:45,292 --> 00:56:48,307
I'm sure Lee Seongmo's
name will pop up as well.

633
00:56:55,789 --> 00:56:58,793
Yes... All right.

634
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:02,966
I'll be by your side, Sir.

635
00:57:03,278 --> 00:57:04,637
Yes.

636
00:57:05,743 --> 00:57:09,382
Ahh... I can't take this anymore.

637
00:57:09,511 --> 00:57:12,735
- Forgot it's your turn?
- All right.

638
00:57:15,010 --> 00:57:16,244
What's the matter?

639
00:57:16,415 --> 00:57:21,219
Looks like the direct elections that
congress couldn't bring to fruition...

640
00:57:21,716 --> 00:57:24,480
will be dragged into the streets.

641
00:57:24,826 --> 00:57:26,930
Are you going to participate as well?

642
00:57:27,176 --> 00:57:29,441
After all we've gone
through to get to this point,

643
00:57:29,532 --> 00:57:31,358
why would I possibly hesitate?

644
00:57:31,687 --> 00:57:35,058
Unless I'm given a second life,

645
00:57:35,167 --> 00:57:37,734
I'll have to take this to the end.

646
00:57:41,316 --> 00:57:43,523
Who are you people?

647
00:57:43,651 --> 00:57:45,185
Mister Hwang Taeseop?

648
00:57:45,342 --> 00:57:47,626
You'll have to follow us.

649
00:57:48,042 --> 00:57:49,455
Follow you where?

650
00:57:50,148 --> 00:57:51,825
You... What are you people?

651
00:57:51,982 --> 00:57:55,086
Ju Youngguk... Take him as well.

652
00:57:55,182 --> 00:57:57,473
- Yes.
- You really...

653
00:57:58,007 --> 00:58:00,374
Where are you taking him?

654
00:58:00,485 --> 00:58:02,517
Dad! Dad!!

655
00:58:04,131 --> 00:58:06,615
I told you to take a few days off,
what are you doing here?

656
00:58:06,896 --> 00:58:08,144
I'm all right, Sir.

657
00:58:08,315 --> 00:58:11,926
If not me, who would be by your side?

658
00:58:16,525 --> 00:58:18,589
What is all this?

659
00:58:19,147 --> 00:58:21,746
Why was my father arrested?

660
00:58:21,985 --> 00:58:23,933
Isn't that what you wanted?

661
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:26,670
You asked me for information
from the opposition party,

662
00:58:26,742 --> 00:58:29,751
we never talked of arresting my father.

663
00:58:31,413 --> 00:58:34,634
What will happen to him?

664
00:58:34,816 --> 00:58:35,991
Don't worry.

665
00:58:36,206 --> 00:58:39,795
If he tells us what we need,
he'll be released in no time.

666
00:58:40,104 --> 00:58:42,186
And how are you going to
get that confession out of him?

667
00:58:42,368 --> 00:58:45,162
Will you torture him?

668
00:58:46,365 --> 00:58:51,778
Now that his father is in danger,
seems like the prodigal son finally woke up?!

669
00:58:51,887 --> 00:58:54,686
This is not the kind of revenge I wished for.

670
00:58:54,916 --> 00:58:55,919
Release him.

671
00:58:56,076 --> 00:58:59,358
I couldn't care less what you wish for.

672
00:58:59,787 --> 00:59:02,295
What I need is intel,

673
00:59:02,696 --> 00:59:06,336
so if you want your father
to be released, bring it to me.

674
00:59:08,252 --> 00:59:11,261
I do have a photo.

675
00:59:11,763 --> 00:59:13,244
A photo?!

676
00:59:13,382 --> 00:59:15,020
It wasn't shot properly,

677
00:59:15,202 --> 00:59:17,522
so it won't be of much help.

678
00:59:17,996 --> 00:59:20,059
You have it on you?

679
00:59:23,585 --> 00:59:27,589
It's the man who's been
meeting in secret with my father.

680
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:39,412
Isn't this...

681
00:59:39,935 --> 00:59:42,091
Lee Seongmo?

682
00:59:46,146 --> 00:59:47,579
Yes...

683
00:59:48,310 --> 00:59:50,545
It does look like him.

684
01:00:02,056 --> 01:00:04,727
Sorry for treating
you that way all this time.

685
01:00:05,036 --> 01:00:06,613
Don't say that...

686
01:00:06,735 --> 01:00:11,805
You must be having it really hard,
and I'm not doing anything to help...

687
01:00:11,901 --> 01:00:13,225
I should apologize.

688
01:00:13,336 --> 01:00:16,846
Once your tenure as recruit is over,
where would you like to be assigned to?

689
01:00:16,943 --> 01:00:19,552
I'll work under you for sure.

690
01:00:19,656 --> 01:00:21,384
You'll take me, right?

691
01:00:21,508 --> 01:00:25,987
If you want to choose your
assignment, you need to win points.

692
01:00:27,148 --> 01:00:28,982
Are you working hard on those reports?

693
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:33,897
Don't you worry! I can write
reports like the best of them.

694
01:00:34,728 --> 01:00:36,562
Take it.

695
01:00:38,221 --> 01:00:39,302
I'm Lee Gangmo.

696
01:00:39,395 --> 01:00:41,348
Just a moment.

697
01:00:41,620 --> 01:00:45,056
It's a certain Lee Gangmo.

698
01:00:57,679 --> 01:00:59,856
Yes, go ahead.

699
01:01:01,232 --> 01:01:05,058
So you have found clear evidence?

700
01:01:06,863 --> 01:01:08,611
Write this down.

701
01:01:10,976 --> 01:01:13,612
Tell me time and place, please.

702
01:01:16,254 --> 01:01:17,887
This week.

703
01:01:18,172 --> 01:01:21,298
Wednesday night, at nine.

704
01:01:22,516 --> 01:01:24,665
Have you written it down?

705
01:01:25,539 --> 01:01:27,330
Be there on time.

706
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:29,021
All right.

707
01:01:30,110 --> 01:01:32,873
Was that spy fella next to him?

708
01:01:33,243 --> 01:01:34,496
It's a woman.

709
01:01:34,722 --> 01:01:36,097
A woman?

710
01:01:36,685 --> 01:01:39,995
You'll have to help
me with that, Shideok.

711
01:01:40,152 --> 01:01:42,474
All right.
Don't worry, Gangmo.

712
01:01:45,688 --> 01:01:47,879
Take good care of that memo.

713
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:49,727
Yes, Chief.

714
01:01:54,585 --> 01:01:55,548
Yes.

715
01:01:55,789 --> 01:01:56,983
It's me, Seongmo.

716
01:01:57,107 --> 01:01:59,013
Where are you now?

717
01:02:08,483 --> 01:02:15,413
I sometimes come here alone,
whenever my head hurts.

718
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:19,186
Seongmo.

719
01:02:22,453 --> 01:02:25,918
I still like you.

720
01:02:26,121 --> 01:02:27,870
Do you know that?

721
01:02:29,632 --> 01:02:35,020
Since we're here,
I guess I should agree.

722
01:02:35,621 --> 01:02:40,937
I know that things aren't what
they used to be anymore.

723
01:02:41,539 --> 01:02:45,036
I can't really figure out when
things started going downhill.

724
01:02:49,162 --> 01:02:54,836
Did you kill Chanseong?

725
01:02:58,304 --> 01:02:59,909
Right...
That's right.

726
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:05,468
I think misunderstandings
like this were to blame.

727
01:03:05,927 --> 01:03:08,703
If you didn't do it,
then that's all I need to know.

728
01:03:08,989 --> 01:03:11,483
I'll believe you, from now on.

729
01:03:23,643 --> 01:03:26,065
Seeing these autumn leaves,

730
01:03:26,538 --> 01:03:31,080
I get the feeling that growing
old is not that bad after all.

731
01:03:34,032 --> 01:03:37,127
I guess it's newfound
passion for one's final days.

732
01:03:52,265 --> 01:03:53,669
Right...

733
01:03:54,386 --> 01:03:56,089
Well said.

734
01:03:56,771 --> 01:04:00,946
Then, they fall to the ground.

735
01:04:03,554 --> 01:04:05,531
And die.

736
01:04:06,501 --> 01:04:09,510
