5
00:00:33,806 --> 00:00:35,181
Yes.

6
00:00:38,305 --> 00:00:39,964
<i>Shideok...</i>

7
00:00:40,277 --> 00:00:41,509
Gangmo!

8
00:00:41,677 --> 00:00:44,193
What's wrong with your voice?

9
00:00:48,233 --> 00:00:50,354
Listen well.

10
00:00:53,596 --> 00:00:56,922
Don't tell this to anyone,

11
00:00:58,223 --> 00:01:00,146
and come here alone.

12
00:01:01,551 --> 00:01:03,268
Quick.

13
00:01:07,282 --> 00:01:09,020
Jeongyeon.

14
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:13,400
How hurt was he?

15
00:01:13,504 --> 00:01:16,016
He sounded like he was about to die.

16
00:01:16,173 --> 00:01:18,058
Shideok, speed up, will you?

17
00:01:18,151 --> 00:01:19,322
Yes.

18
00:01:23,913 --> 00:01:25,208
Gangmo!

19
00:01:25,295 --> 00:01:27,553
Gangmo, where are you?

20
00:01:27,762 --> 00:01:29,636
- Gangmo!
- Gangmo!

21
00:01:29,746 --> 00:01:31,115
Gangmo...

22
00:01:31,587 --> 00:01:32,704
Gangmo!

23
00:01:32,852 --> 00:01:34,405
Gangmo.

24
00:01:34,676 --> 00:01:36,327
Gangmo.

25
00:01:37,046 --> 00:01:38,569
Gangmo!

26
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:40,826
What happened to you?

27
00:01:41,305 --> 00:01:43,154
I told you to come alone...

28
00:01:43,361 --> 00:01:44,423
Are you all right?

29
00:01:44,546 --> 00:01:46,309
What is all this about?

30
00:01:46,407 --> 00:01:48,651
Don't worry, Agasshi.

31
00:01:49,374 --> 00:01:50,990
I'm all r...

32
00:01:56,498 --> 00:01:57,746
Gangmo...

33
00:01:57,857 --> 00:01:59,710
<i>Gangmo!</i>

34
00:01:59,803 --> 00:02:01,814
<i>Gangmo!</i>

35
00:02:06,796 --> 00:02:11,737
Gangmo... Wake up.
We're here.

36
00:02:13,489 --> 00:02:14,978
Gangmo.

37
00:02:15,138 --> 00:02:18,266
Doctor... Doctor!

38
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:22,210
<i>This will hurt.</i>

39
00:02:32,201 --> 00:02:36,115
<i>There... It's done.
Here it is.</i>

40
00:03:00,131 --> 00:03:01,103
<i>Hello?</i>

41
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,525
Jeongshik. 
It's me, Minwoo.

42
00:03:03,619 --> 00:03:05,007
Has Jeongyeon come home?

43
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,978
<i>She's not here?</i>

44
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,617
She's not?

45
00:03:08,826 --> 00:03:12,000
<i>She went out to meet Gangmo,
and still hasn't come back.</i>

46
00:03:12,499 --> 00:03:14,514
Lee Gangmo?!

47
00:03:15,636 --> 00:03:17,664
Don't you know 
where she was headed?

48
00:03:17,752 --> 00:03:20,873
<i>No idea.
I'm tired, so let's hang up.</i>

49
00:03:37,328 --> 00:03:40,422
Gangmo.
How are you feeling?

50
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:42,539
Agasshi.

51
00:03:43,837 --> 00:03:46,619
We're at a hospital.

52
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:53,460
For gunfire wounds,
they'll surely notify the police.

53
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:56,273
The director is friends with my father.

54
00:03:56,372 --> 00:03:58,948
There's no need to worry.

55
00:04:01,215 --> 00:04:03,348
Still not curfew, right?

56
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:08,996
Just lie down.

57
00:04:09,132 --> 00:04:11,479
I'll sleep here tonight.

58
00:04:12,428 --> 00:04:13,539
Agasshi...

59
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:15,130
You can't sleep outside.

60
00:04:15,212 --> 00:04:16,841
<i>You fool.</i>

61
00:04:16,937 --> 00:04:19,830
Is it time to be worrying about me?

62
00:04:20,014 --> 00:04:23,254
You were shot, and risked death!

63
00:04:24,517 --> 00:04:27,487
Why are you always 
so foolish and reckless?

64
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:29,582
I told you I would
take care of my father.

65
00:04:29,693 --> 00:04:31,160
And how?

66
00:04:31,445 --> 00:04:33,706
By marrying Jo Minwoo?

67
00:04:36,206 --> 00:04:38,141
Just wait a little longer.

68
00:04:38,355 --> 00:04:43,330
- I'll find that account, and...
- My father's being released tomorrow.

69
00:04:48,444 --> 00:04:51,514
It's all been taken care of, now.

70
00:05:07,796 --> 00:05:11,696
Jeongyeon... No.
Where is Lee Gangmo?

71
00:05:12,767 --> 00:05:15,857
Why, they told you he was with her?

72
00:05:16,153 --> 00:05:17,986
I know everything already.

73
00:05:18,097 --> 00:05:19,552
Where is Lee Gangmo?

74
00:05:19,663 --> 00:05:23,902
I said I don't know!
Why are you doing this to me?

75
00:05:40,302 --> 00:05:42,212
Gangmo.

76
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,422
Are you sleeping?

77
00:06:00,787 --> 00:06:02,944
You are...

78
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,665
Gangmo.

79
00:06:09,883 --> 00:06:11,966
Thanks.

80
00:06:14,849 --> 00:06:17,339
For making it alive.

81
00:06:18,214 --> 00:06:19,606
<i>Also...</i>

82
00:06:20,642 --> 00:06:23,661
<i>for protecting me all this time.</i>

83
00:06:24,808 --> 00:06:31,821
I wish things could be 
a little easier for you.

84
00:06:34,914 --> 00:06:38,563
Wish I could see you
live in a nice house,

85
00:06:40,058 --> 00:06:43,378
your kids playing all around the yard,

86
00:06:44,331 --> 00:06:50,600
as your pretty wife is
preparing a tasty dinner for you,

87
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:53,377
<i>waiting for you to come home.</i>

88
00:06:54,676 --> 00:07:00,957
<i>You'd then arrive, your hands filled 
with candies for your children,</i>

89
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:09,012
<i>as your laughter of joy 
echoes all around.</i>

90
00:07:15,347 --> 00:07:17,028
I...

91
00:07:18,548 --> 00:07:25,925
want to see that kind of 
happiness stamped on your face.

92
00:07:29,245 --> 00:07:31,265
That's why...

93
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:39,819
I will no longer try
to keep you all for myself.

94
00:07:41,318 --> 00:07:47,600
<i>I'll no longer bother you,
asking you to remain by my side.</i>

95
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:51,778
Why are you fantasizing 
all on your own?

96
00:07:56,757 --> 00:07:58,951
You weren't sleeping?

97
00:07:59,358 --> 00:08:03,971
I'm not the kind of man...

98
00:08:04,211 --> 00:08:10,257
who will just leave or 
stay by your side as you wish.

99
00:08:12,865 --> 00:08:14,909
Gangmo...

100
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,175
Ever since I turned thirteen,

101
00:08:20,159 --> 00:08:23,191
you've been like family to me.

102
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,225
<i>After I lost my siblings and parents,</i>

103
00:08:28,668 --> 00:08:31,343
<i>do you know how much happiness...</i>

104
00:08:32,316 --> 00:08:36,458
<i>having a family to protect brought me?</i>

105
00:08:38,838 --> 00:08:45,013
Don't take that happiness 
away from me.

106
00:08:53,522 --> 00:08:55,490
<i>Go ahead and sleep.</i>

107
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:59,126
I'm the patient tonight,

108
00:09:00,802 --> 00:09:03,440
so you'll have to 
make do with the sofa.

109
00:10:00,054 --> 00:10:02,334
Same clothes you wore yesterday, I see.

110
00:10:03,588 --> 00:10:07,222
I'd prefer if you didn't concern
yourself with my fashion choices.

111
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:11,613
We're about to get married.

112
00:10:12,647 --> 00:10:14,639
It's not like we're 
doing that out of love.

113
00:10:14,732 --> 00:10:16,196
So, what...

114
00:10:16,592 --> 00:10:18,456
Let's not care about 
whatever the other is doing?

115
00:10:18,555 --> 00:10:21,081
Will be much less trouble 
for the both of us.

116
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:25,124
If that's your wish, fine with me.

117
00:10:43,777 --> 00:10:45,621
Dad.

118
00:10:46,367 --> 00:10:48,579
Are you feeling okay?
No injuries at all?

119
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,874
Mom is waiting for you with
all your favorite dishes.

120
00:10:50,982 --> 00:10:53,114
Let's hurry up home, Dad.

121
00:11:10,563 --> 00:11:15,452
So you're going to 
get married with Minwoo?

122
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:19,482
I also promised them we'd
support his father's candidacy.

123
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:22,908
It wasn't for me to decide,

124
00:11:23,258 --> 00:11:25,678
but I had no other choice.

125
00:11:26,609 --> 00:11:29,776
Are you confident 
you'll be happy with him?

126
00:11:31,514 --> 00:11:38,564
That you won't regret marrying him,
and you will lead a happy life?

127
00:11:42,033 --> 00:11:44,092
I really don't know.

128
00:11:44,878 --> 00:11:47,851
What "leading a happy life" means.

129
00:11:49,749 --> 00:11:52,892
Don't answer your father 
that way, you silly.

130
00:11:54,486 --> 00:12:00,155
When it comes to business,
I never had any scruples.

131
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:05,297
But with one's children,
that's another story.

132
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,261
This marriage is nothing but business.

133
00:12:12,938 --> 00:12:15,343
That's what led me to that decision.

134
00:12:18,966 --> 00:12:23,222
I'm happy you got out safe.

135
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:26,684
If your mother were here,

136
00:12:28,367 --> 00:12:31,380
she'd have been against this marriage.

137
00:12:35,225 --> 00:12:39,724
I wonder how angry she will be,

138
00:12:40,305 --> 00:12:46,751
when we meet again in the afterlife.

139
00:12:53,222 --> 00:12:55,507
I won't regret this.

140
00:12:57,812 --> 00:13:02,853
I'll marry Jo Minwoo, 
and live a happy life.

141
00:13:04,738 --> 00:13:07,749
If I think of marriage as
just another business venture,

142
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:11,397
then I'm confident I can do well.

143
00:13:38,448 --> 00:13:40,370
So what do I owe the occasion to?

144
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:44,178
Are the committee members
still under investigation?

145
00:13:44,278 --> 00:13:46,376
One was released,

146
00:13:46,485 --> 00:13:48,920
and as for the rest
of the suspected, not yet.

147
00:13:49,016 --> 00:13:53,741
Release them all,
and wrap up the investigations.

148
00:13:54,136 --> 00:13:55,038
Congressman.

149
00:13:55,129 --> 00:13:58,378
I released Hong Gipyo and
cleared him of all accusations.

150
00:13:58,467 --> 00:13:59,657
What are you saying?

151
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:01,576
You released Hong Gipyo?!

152
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:05,135
We found his account.

153
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:25,108
If we only get rid of that account,

154
00:14:25,306 --> 00:14:29,903
all the obstacles threatening Gangnam's
redevelopment will go away with it.

155
00:14:31,201 --> 00:14:33,493
And how are you going
to deal with the opposition?

156
00:14:33,604 --> 00:14:35,194
They have no evidence,

157
00:14:35,317 --> 00:14:37,351
what could they possibly do?

158
00:14:37,672 --> 00:14:40,161
The press already 
has set its eyes on this.

159
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:43,441
- If we wrap up investigations...
- As for the press, no need to worry.

160
00:14:43,552 --> 00:14:47,434
Manipulate things a little, and it will
fly out of people's radar in no time.

161
00:14:47,557 --> 00:14:50,404
<i>Right... That's your specialty, isn't it?</i>

162
00:14:50,527 --> 00:14:54,804
I've had it with this damned account,
so burn it to ashes.

163
00:15:21,999 --> 00:15:24,292
<i>What the hell have you been doing?</i>

164
00:15:24,489 --> 00:15:28,796
What were you doing while
Min Honggi got hold of that account?

165
00:15:29,154 --> 00:15:33,142
I apologize. I couldn't 
catch wind of the situation.

166
00:15:33,443 --> 00:15:36,795
How did he manage 
to find that account?

167
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:41,791
In exchange for his release, 
it seems like Hong Gipyo confessed.

168
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:44,860
Where is Hong Gipyo?

169
00:15:45,052 --> 00:15:46,771
They transferred him
straight to the hospital.

170
00:15:46,907 --> 00:15:50,641
Stick a few of our boys
outside his room, day and night.

171
00:15:50,838 --> 00:15:54,127
By now, Director Min must have
already gotten rid of the account.

172
00:15:54,235 --> 00:15:56,388
He even survived electroshock.

173
00:15:56,511 --> 00:15:59,839
Why do you think someone like him 
would confess only now?

174
00:16:00,246 --> 00:16:01,762
Then...

175
00:16:02,637 --> 00:16:06,643
I'm sure he made a copy of it.

176
00:16:07,261 --> 00:16:09,636
Trail him thoroughly.

177
00:16:09,812 --> 00:16:11,932
Yes, Director.

178
00:16:25,562 --> 00:16:26,955
Honey.

179
00:16:27,214 --> 00:16:29,420
Can you hear me?

180
00:16:29,667 --> 00:16:31,688
Chairman!

181
00:16:56,126 --> 00:16:57,560
Honey!

182
00:16:57,651 --> 00:16:59,663
What's the matter, Chairman?

183
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:02,252
There... Take a look at that clock.

184
00:17:02,387 --> 00:17:04,778
Look at that fool.

185
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:11,818
What's wrong, Honey?

186
00:17:11,907 --> 00:17:14,376
Get a hold of yourself!

187
00:17:14,702 --> 00:17:16,960
Chairman...

188
00:17:21,502 --> 00:17:24,047
You have some visitors...

189
00:17:26,697 --> 00:17:28,336
Chairman Hong.

190
00:17:28,509 --> 00:17:30,848
How are you feeling?

191
00:17:35,643 --> 00:17:37,319
I apologize.

192
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:38,847
Help me out.

193
00:17:38,983 --> 00:17:40,906
Chairman Hong, what's wrong with you?

194
00:17:41,016 --> 00:17:43,124
It's us, Chairman Hong.

195
00:17:43,901 --> 00:17:45,495
I didn't do it.

196
00:17:45,588 --> 00:17:46,936
I apologize.

197
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,430
Help me out.

198
00:17:48,506 --> 00:17:51,530
I beg you, help me out!
Help me... Help me!

199
00:17:51,629 --> 00:17:54,020
- Help... Help...
- Chairman Hong!

200
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:55,955
<i>Chairman Hong!</i>

201
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:00,593
This is serious.

202
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:05,387
What's the matter, all of a sudden?
The patient is acting strange?!

203
00:18:05,498 --> 00:18:07,779
Seems like he suffered
some kind of head trauma.

204
00:18:16,408 --> 00:18:22,644
So are the rumors that 
Hong Gipyo has gone mad true?

205
00:18:22,804 --> 00:18:23,926
That's what I've heard.

206
00:18:24,115 --> 00:18:25,511
Thank you, Director.

207
00:18:25,603 --> 00:18:29,464
My father getting out safely 
is all thanks to you.

208
00:18:31,621 --> 00:18:36,306
There are also instances of 
imaginary maladies, from time to time.

209
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:38,261
Imaginary?!

210
00:18:38,353 --> 00:18:41,264
Be it because of fear
of being investigated again,

211
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:44,358
or as a result of ulterior purposes.

212
00:18:44,506 --> 00:18:48,815
Wasn't all this case wrapped up?

213
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:53,573
Hong Gipyo might 
still have that account.

214
00:18:54,214 --> 00:18:59,230
Because he's more than capable 
of having made a copy.

215
00:19:05,013 --> 00:19:08,162
With the kids' engagement
and the subway construction,

216
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:10,615
you have a lot on 
your plate, these days.

217
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:15,040
<i>Don't worry about a thing,
and take good care of yourself.</i>

218
00:19:15,809 --> 00:19:18,158
Here, let me pour you one.

219
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:21,488
Let's drink the night away.

220
00:19:31,102 --> 00:19:33,430
Hey... Hey... Jeongshik!
Get a hold of yourself.

221
00:19:33,517 --> 00:19:35,366
I said I'm all right...

222
00:19:35,513 --> 00:19:37,707
Dad. Are you just going?

223
00:19:37,831 --> 00:19:39,020
Don't you want another few drinks?

224
00:19:39,098 --> 00:19:40,320
You fool.

225
00:19:40,518 --> 00:19:43,919
Who the hell are you,
to accept drinks from anyone?

226
00:19:44,005 --> 00:19:46,379
Ahh... Really, Dad.

227
00:19:46,472 --> 00:19:51,592
My sister is getting married,
can't I even accept drinks from my in-laws...

228
00:19:52,664 --> 00:19:54,604
I've had it with this fool.

229
00:19:54,709 --> 00:19:57,742
- Send him home right away.
- Let's get going.

230
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:01,875
<i>Ahh... I'm not drunk at all...</i>

231
00:20:02,466 --> 00:20:06,041
Dad. Wonder if 
Myeongwol is doing fine?!

232
00:20:06,201 --> 00:20:08,284
I'll get going!

233
00:20:12,425 --> 00:20:14,310
Ohh... Gangmo.

234
00:20:14,837 --> 00:20:16,936
Let's have a word.

235
00:20:17,663 --> 00:20:21,497
Are you telling me Chairman Hong 
might have another account?

236
00:20:21,608 --> 00:20:24,701
We might be about to become in-laws,

237
00:20:24,836 --> 00:20:28,358
but I don't trust Director Jo.

238
00:20:28,467 --> 00:20:33,541
We can't allow him to get
his hands on that account.

239
00:20:34,336 --> 00:20:36,505
I'll find it.

240
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:39,389
Don't you worry, Chairman.

241
00:20:40,043 --> 00:20:45,785
I've heard you risked your life.

242
00:20:53,148 --> 00:21:00,737
I know how much you go 
through every day for my sake.

243
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:05,704
I will make up for that,
whatever it takes.

244
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:10,836
Chairman.

245
00:21:12,315 --> 00:21:14,755
You're like a father to me.

246
00:21:17,048 --> 00:21:19,722
That's what has guided me 
all this time.

247
00:21:20,853 --> 00:21:25,051
And it's something 
that will never change.

248
00:21:25,244 --> 00:21:26,973
Right...

249
00:21:27,466 --> 00:21:32,557
Thank you for 
seeing it that way, Gangmo.

250
00:21:34,849 --> 00:21:39,082
Ehh... Look at this,
what is happening to this world...

251
00:21:43,075 --> 00:21:45,294
Where is his guardian?

252
00:21:47,217 --> 00:21:50,598
She's not feeling well, 
so she went home.

253
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:55,293
We will either have to discharge him,
or transfer him to a mental institution.

254
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:58,917
I'll discuss it with his wife.

255
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,778
Then...

256
00:22:06,381 --> 00:22:09,796
You're reading it upside down.

257
00:22:27,449 --> 00:22:29,409
Where's the account?

258
00:22:30,654 --> 00:22:32,151
That copy I gave you.

259
00:22:32,274 --> 00:22:34,012
Where did you put it?

260
00:22:34,468 --> 00:22:36,341
Chairman...

261
00:22:38,338 --> 00:22:41,284
There are still people spying on me.

262
00:22:45,622 --> 00:22:49,211
Then, are you just 
acting like this on purpose?

263
00:22:49,384 --> 00:22:50,789
Miju.

264
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:55,275
Can you help me out one more time?

265
00:22:55,956 --> 00:22:59,717
First, have them discharge me.

266
00:22:59,852 --> 00:23:05,990
After that, bring me the account. 
Got it?

267
00:23:07,395 --> 00:23:10,403
I'll go file all the documents
for your discharge right away.

268
00:23:17,532 --> 00:23:19,405
Even if you get out of here,

269
00:23:19,553 --> 00:23:22,116
it won't be easy to stop
Director Jo from suspecting you.

270
00:23:22,277 --> 00:23:24,249
Don't you worry.

271
00:23:24,647 --> 00:23:26,895
I have a plan.

272
00:23:30,174 --> 00:23:32,008
You just wait.

273
00:23:32,476 --> 00:23:36,973
How my revenge will taste like.

274
00:23:39,268 --> 00:23:42,604
Have a drink.
Minwoo, you too.

275
00:23:45,802 --> 00:23:49,609
We are family now.

276
00:23:50,905 --> 00:23:52,273
Minwoo, what are you waiting for?

277
00:23:52,458 --> 00:23:54,916
Pour your father-in-law a drink.

278
00:23:55,139 --> 00:23:56,408
Yes.

279
00:24:10,457 --> 00:24:14,951
Let's set the engagement
ceremony for next Saturday.

280
00:24:16,837 --> 00:24:19,746
Aren't we going a little too fast?

281
00:24:19,922 --> 00:24:24,504
If it were up to me, 
I'd just get them married that day.

282
00:24:25,774 --> 00:24:28,251
How about you, Jeongyeon?

283
00:24:28,892 --> 00:24:31,665
It makes no difference to me.

284
00:24:35,481 --> 00:24:38,187
All the complicated talk is dealt with,

285
00:24:38,723 --> 00:24:43,172
so Minwoo, 
take Jeongyeon and go have fun.

286
00:24:43,357 --> 00:24:45,863
You're already wrapping things up?

287
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:48,314
I haven't even talked once 
with Jeongyeon.

288
00:24:48,424 --> 00:24:51,339
<i>You'll get plenty of chances
to do so, from now on.</i>

289
00:24:51,431 --> 00:24:54,354
What are you doing?
You can go.

290
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,005
Yes.

291
00:24:56,204 --> 00:24:58,849
Then, if you'll excuse me...

292
00:25:07,265 --> 00:25:09,155
Have fun.

293
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:14,023
- Here... Let's have a drink.
- Yes.

294
00:25:29,074 --> 00:25:31,745
I have other plans, so I need to go.

295
00:25:32,719 --> 00:25:37,045
You didn't want to go out
on a date with me, did you?

296
00:25:37,883 --> 00:25:42,801
You'll tell the director we had 
the best of times on our date, right?

297
00:25:44,248 --> 00:25:47,169
Gangmo, can you give me a lift?

298
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:04,085
I want to take a walk.

299
00:26:04,294 --> 00:26:06,365
Is there any place 
you could take me to?

300
00:26:06,542 --> 00:26:09,151
I need to do something 
for the chairman.

301
00:26:09,779 --> 00:26:12,043
Just go back to work.

302
00:26:12,705 --> 00:26:14,570
What is it?

303
00:26:16,111 --> 00:26:18,268
What did my father tell you to do?

304
00:26:18,367 --> 00:26:19,315
Company work.

305
00:26:19,438 --> 00:26:21,549
What company work?

306
00:26:23,399 --> 00:26:25,531
If it has anything to do with Chairman Hong, 
don't even think about it.

307
00:26:25,655 --> 00:26:29,327
Don't worry about me 
and do your work.

308
00:26:32,439 --> 00:26:34,726
Lee Gangmo...

309
00:26:44,167 --> 00:26:45,856
Honey.

310
00:26:50,346 --> 00:26:54,561
Are you all right?

311
00:26:55,251 --> 00:26:57,063
I'm fine.

312
00:26:57,815 --> 00:26:59,417
You've had it hard, right?

313
00:26:59,504 --> 00:27:01,533
What happened?

314
00:27:01,631 --> 00:27:03,501
It's a long story.

315
00:27:03,698 --> 00:27:08,240
But forget that. 
You'll have to go down to Jeju.

316
00:27:08,382 --> 00:27:09,614
Jeju?!

317
00:27:09,738 --> 00:27:12,501
I found a nice nursing home there.

318
00:27:12,596 --> 00:27:13,789
And you?

319
00:27:13,949 --> 00:27:16,118
I'll have to wrap up things at work...

320
00:27:16,241 --> 00:27:17,745
I'll be busy.

321
00:27:17,905 --> 00:27:23,225
Can't I wait here 
and leave with you later?

322
00:27:29,995 --> 00:27:32,281
We'll spend the rest 
of our days together,

323
00:27:32,392 --> 00:27:34,315
what are you worrying for?

324
00:27:35,609 --> 00:27:39,233
I want to quit being a businessman.

325
00:27:39,627 --> 00:27:42,920
Let's just raise stock 
in the countryside,

326
00:27:43,235 --> 00:27:46,001
and spend the rest 
of our days in peace.

327
00:27:52,484 --> 00:27:54,784
Honey...

328
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:11,313
I'll leave her to you until Jeju Island.

329
00:28:11,514 --> 00:28:13,802
Don't you worry, Chairman.

330
00:28:23,294 --> 00:28:25,964
You must remain healthy, Ma'am.

331
00:28:27,904 --> 00:28:32,353
I bet you're happy that you won't
have to listen to my bell anymore?

332
00:28:32,551 --> 00:28:34,868
I thought I would,

333
00:28:35,167 --> 00:28:37,761
but I'm sad.

334
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:45,365
<i>Take this.</i>

335
00:28:48,274 --> 00:28:51,175
What's this?

336
00:28:53,283 --> 00:28:57,141
It's a savings account in your name
I've been keeping all this time.

337
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,704
Ma'am...

338
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,810
I wanted to give you this 
when you got married.

339
00:29:04,714 --> 00:29:06,879
In your mother's place.

340
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,817
When you find your brothers,

341
00:29:18,125 --> 00:29:20,972
you'll come to Jeju, right?

342
00:29:26,395 --> 00:29:28,503
<i>Yes, Ma'am.</i>

343
00:29:28,822 --> 00:29:31,687
Let's meet again.

344
00:29:37,764 --> 00:29:39,674
Here... You'll be late.

345
00:29:39,773 --> 00:29:41,671
Get going.

346
00:30:05,441 --> 00:30:07,586
Are you done packing?

347
00:30:15,528 --> 00:30:16,514
Look.

348
00:30:16,637 --> 00:30:18,732
Can you see your face shine in there?

349
00:30:18,934 --> 00:30:21,271
Wow... Ajeosshi, you're really great.

350
00:30:21,396 --> 00:30:23,785
You little scoundrel,
that's how you shine shoes.

351
00:30:23,876 --> 00:30:25,687
Go! Out of the way.

352
00:30:26,266 --> 00:30:27,967
And my money?

353
00:30:28,694 --> 00:30:30,789
You little... 
What do you take your seonbae for?

354
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:33,689
After teaching you the tricks 
of the trade, you should pay me.

355
00:30:33,783 --> 00:30:35,208
Still, pay me!

356
00:30:35,296 --> 00:30:37,407
Look at him, staring straight!

357
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:41,497
Ohhh... Fine.
I'll pay you.

358
00:30:42,582 --> 00:30:45,267
How much should I give him...

359
00:30:47,117 --> 00:30:48,463
Dream on, you little twerp.

360
00:30:48,554 --> 00:30:51,308
Before I get my shoes dirty again, 
out of my sight!

361
00:30:51,431 --> 00:30:54,466
Little rascals...
Never listening to adults...

362
00:30:54,568 --> 00:30:56,308
Ajeosshi.

363
00:30:56,403 --> 00:30:58,669
You still haven't left?

364
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,369
You little... How dare you...

365
00:31:00,493 --> 00:31:03,315
Come here! You!

366
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:05,638
Aigoo... Really...

367
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:07,974
You're here?

368
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:09,626
Have a seat.

369
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:15,875
What were you talking about?

370
00:31:16,323 --> 00:31:17,576
His housemaid quit?

371
00:31:17,674 --> 00:31:21,026
Don't even get me started.
The whole family split up.

372
00:31:21,224 --> 00:31:23,158
Any idea where that housemaid went?

373
00:31:23,269 --> 00:31:24,206
Where she moved to.

374
00:31:24,292 --> 00:31:28,056
I'd like to know, too.
Ahh... Should have dated her once...

375
00:31:28,151 --> 00:31:30,677
Find out where she is right away.

376
00:31:30,787 --> 00:31:35,176
The chairman has gone batty,
how the hell am I supposed to do that?

377
00:31:35,261 --> 00:31:37,695
If I tell you something, just do it!

378
00:32:27,378 --> 00:32:28,942
<i>Miju.</i>

379
00:32:29,202 --> 00:32:30,693
<i>What?</i>

380
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:35,906
You keep this account.

381
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,579
Even using a safe box at
the bank makes me nervous.

382
00:32:39,752 --> 00:32:43,806
When the time comes,
I'll come looking for it.

383
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:47,923
What are you trying to do?

384
00:32:49,463 --> 00:32:50,955
Chairman.

385
00:32:51,103 --> 00:32:53,678
I feel like I'm putting too heavy 
a burden on your shoulders,

386
00:32:53,826 --> 00:32:55,330
so forgive me.

387
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,010
Where do I hide this?

388
00:33:11,214 --> 00:33:14,335
Hey... What's wrong with you?

389
00:33:17,796 --> 00:33:20,606
Let me ask you something.

390
00:33:21,111 --> 00:33:23,160
Does Jeongyeon like Gangmo?

391
00:33:23,271 --> 00:33:26,118
What?! Hey...

392
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:29,372
Are you telling me you're
jealous of someone like Gangmo?

393
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:32,384
I asked you a question!

394
00:33:33,402 --> 00:33:35,365
Gangmo is nothing but a servant,

395
00:33:35,456 --> 00:33:37,729
and Jeongyeon is his keeper.

396
00:33:37,877 --> 00:33:39,196
And I thought 
something serious was up...

397
00:33:39,307 --> 00:33:42,512
And how would you possibly know...

398
00:33:44,126 --> 00:33:47,972
Give it a rest, Minwoo.

399
00:33:50,387 --> 00:33:53,647
But I'm sure Gangmo likes Jeongyeon.

400
00:33:53,806 --> 00:33:55,175
Isn't it laughable?

401
00:33:55,323 --> 00:33:58,368
He should know his place.

402
00:33:58,971 --> 00:34:00,417
<i>Jeongshik Oppa!</i>

403
00:34:00,598 --> 00:34:02,755
Ohh... Myeongwol!

404
00:34:02,903 --> 00:34:05,178
Why do you show up 
so rarely these days?

405
00:34:05,316 --> 00:34:07,838
I'm busy at work, what else?

406
00:34:07,974 --> 00:34:10,710
He's about to get married.

407
00:34:10,845 --> 00:34:12,706
Pour him a drink.

408
00:34:14,013 --> 00:34:16,231
Congratulations.

409
00:34:18,425 --> 00:34:20,363
Ahh... You little...

410
00:34:21,485 --> 00:34:23,429
Myeongwol.

411
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:28,749
I'm staying here for the night.

412
00:34:28,878 --> 00:34:30,396
Really?

413
00:34:30,457 --> 00:34:32,904
Are you going to spend it with me?

414
00:34:35,381 --> 00:34:37,464
<i>Pour me another.</i>

415
00:34:38,795 --> 00:34:40,891
Oppa... Slow down.

416
00:34:50,908 --> 00:34:53,349
Myeongwol...

417
00:34:54,951 --> 00:34:56,393
What's this?

418
00:34:58,402 --> 00:34:59,862
Those two...

419
00:34:59,973 --> 00:35:03,313
Where have they gone,
while I was in the men's room?

420
00:35:16,082 --> 00:35:17,968
Get out of the way.

421
00:35:20,889 --> 00:35:22,750
What's the matter?

422
00:35:25,018 --> 00:35:26,965
What's wrong with you?

423
00:35:27,329 --> 00:35:29,463
Get the hell out.

424
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:41,011
What got into you?!

425
00:35:57,444 --> 00:35:59,679
It's quite late.

426
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:01,819
And Gangmo?

427
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:05,406
Gangmo?! He's still not back.

428
00:36:08,232 --> 00:36:11,010
I told you to take it easy at the table.

429
00:36:11,206 --> 00:36:13,031
<i>Shideok.</i>

430
00:36:13,327 --> 00:36:15,878
What is Gangmo doing, these days?

431
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:19,403
What did the chairman entrust to him?

432
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:22,497
I... Agasshi.

433
00:36:22,775 --> 00:36:28,159
I'm well aware that
I shouldn't even say this,

434
00:36:28,509 --> 00:36:31,080
but leave Gangmo alone.

435
00:36:31,255 --> 00:36:32,436
What are you trying to say?

436
00:36:32,596 --> 00:36:35,307
Because of you, Gangmo is always...

437
00:36:37,883 --> 00:36:39,103
Never mind.

438
00:36:39,227 --> 00:36:40,396
Go ahead.

439
00:36:40,533 --> 00:36:42,727
Because of me, Gangmo what?

440
00:36:43,664 --> 00:36:45,931
You don't know?

441
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:49,826
<i>Hwang Jeongyeon!</i>

442
00:36:50,525 --> 00:36:53,003
<i>Hwang Jeongyeon, come out!</i>

443
00:36:53,892 --> 00:36:55,766
<i>Come here!</i>

444
00:36:58,971 --> 00:37:01,549
<i>I said come out, Hwang Jeongyeon!</i>

445
00:37:02,816 --> 00:37:04,554
Minwoo.

446
00:37:05,734 --> 00:37:08,400
I had something to tell you.

447
00:37:10,618 --> 00:37:11,838
Do you even realize what time it is?

448
00:37:11,912 --> 00:37:13,502
I said I had something to tell you!

449
00:37:13,638 --> 00:37:16,990
What are you doing?
Are you out of your mind?

450
00:37:17,489 --> 00:37:19,027
Go back in, I'll drive him home.

451
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:20,864
Let go!

452
00:37:22,072 --> 00:37:24,512
Hey... Hwang Jeongyeon.

453
00:37:39,695 --> 00:37:42,308
So what did you want to talk about?

454
00:37:45,488 --> 00:37:50,027
After making all this mess,
at least let's listen to it.

455
00:37:50,137 --> 00:37:53,354
I really hate you, Hwang Jeongyeon...

456
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:56,436
I really do.

457
00:37:56,904 --> 00:37:59,209
So much it's suffocating me.

458
00:37:59,423 --> 00:38:00,577
I know.

459
00:38:00,763 --> 00:38:02,146
No...

460
00:38:04,266 --> 00:38:06,041
You don't.

461
00:38:06,978 --> 00:38:09,036
What would you know?

462
00:38:09,926 --> 00:38:12,462
Do you know anything about me?
Anything at all?

463
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:16,019
Is there anything more we
need to know about each other?

464
00:38:16,462 --> 00:38:19,101
We both gained what we wanted, 
so that's it.

465
00:38:19,273 --> 00:38:22,342
Let's not complicate things for nothing.

466
00:38:43,074 --> 00:38:45,468
I think I'm falling in love with you.

467
00:38:50,283 --> 00:38:52,713
I mean it.

468
00:39:06,973 --> 00:39:09,105
Did Jo Minwoo leave?

469
00:39:10,626 --> 00:39:12,767
Let's have a word.

470
00:39:14,863 --> 00:39:17,093
If everything's all right, 
then forget it.

471
00:39:17,722 --> 00:39:19,669
Go to sleep.

472
00:39:21,555 --> 00:39:23,517
Gangmo.

473
00:39:29,482 --> 00:39:33,549
Aigoo... Aigoo!!
You wretched fool.

474
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:39,001
Think this will bring you any benefit?

475
00:39:40,323 --> 00:39:44,086
Did you find out where
that housemaid is living?

476
00:39:44,438 --> 00:39:46,822
Still couldn't find that,

477
00:39:47,173 --> 00:39:50,409
and it seems like she's 
working as a bus conductor now.

478
00:39:51,042 --> 00:39:52,937
Bus conductor?

479
00:39:53,282 --> 00:39:55,205
Which company's buses?

480
00:40:09,525 --> 00:40:11,066
Hurry up.

481
00:40:11,127 --> 00:40:15,175
Hurry up, come on.

482
00:40:15,281 --> 00:40:16,698
The ticket.

483
00:40:16,785 --> 00:40:19,307
Here... Let's hurry up.

484
00:40:19,746 --> 00:40:22,359
Those in front, 
please move and let them pass.

485
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:24,269
Here... Let's hurry up.

486
00:40:24,345 --> 00:40:26,140
All right!

487
00:40:27,261 --> 00:40:30,053
Stop... Stop!

488
00:40:30,634 --> 00:40:32,754
<i>Thank you.</i>

489
00:40:59,146 --> 00:41:02,949
One of our men is 
spying on his wife in Jeju.

490
00:41:03,122 --> 00:41:06,289
Go search Hong Gipyo's house 
when he's not home.

491
00:41:06,482 --> 00:41:08,052
All right.

492
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:10,270
Right...

493
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,651
He also had a housemaid, didn't he?

494
00:41:14,685 --> 00:41:16,782
I think she quit.

495
00:41:17,665 --> 00:41:21,059
She looked suspicious, 
for some reason.

496
00:41:22,008 --> 00:41:24,867
I will take care of finding her.

497
00:41:25,594 --> 00:41:30,553
Shouldn't I come back by your side?

498
00:41:31,415 --> 00:41:33,128
You do that.

499
00:42:13,638 --> 00:42:15,589
What are you doing?

500
00:42:17,129 --> 00:42:18,085
You... moved?!

501
00:42:18,183 --> 00:42:21,172
Why are you following me 
around all day?

502
00:42:21,721 --> 00:42:24,891
Ahh... Bought some 
candles and matches.

503
00:42:26,037 --> 00:42:29,673
Looks like there'll be plenty of 
blackouts in this neighborhood?!

504
00:42:30,375 --> 00:42:31,731
Here.

505
00:42:38,256 --> 00:42:39,825
Can I...

506
00:42:40,589 --> 00:42:42,118
come in a moment?

507
00:42:42,857 --> 00:42:44,031
Are you out of your mind?

508
00:42:44,122 --> 00:42:46,231
Why would you enter 
a single woman's room?

509
00:42:46,327 --> 00:42:48,258
I had something to ask you.

510
00:42:48,353 --> 00:42:51,085
I have nothing to listen to.

511
00:43:07,542 --> 00:43:11,279
Ehh... He's such a nuisance.

512
00:43:14,779 --> 00:43:18,741
Did he find out I have the account?

513
00:43:25,039 --> 00:43:29,711
So how about this quarter's donations?

514
00:43:30,247 --> 00:43:32,163
We'll have to continue, obviously.

515
00:43:32,274 --> 00:43:35,536
First they complain of 
sponsor this and that,

516
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:38,437
and now they're still 
after that money?

517
00:43:38,807 --> 00:43:44,672
From now on, Director 
Jo Pilyeon will be in charge.

518
00:43:44,786 --> 00:43:46,514
Jo Pilyeon?!

519
00:43:46,983 --> 00:43:51,309
That wicked tyrant 
who sent Chairman Hong crazy?

520
00:43:57,999 --> 00:44:02,316
What are you doing here?

521
00:44:05,546 --> 00:44:09,157
Are you feeling any better?

522
00:44:12,463 --> 00:44:13,799
What...

523
00:44:14,367 --> 00:44:15,833
<i>What are you...</i>

524
00:44:15,957 --> 00:44:18,759
Help me. Save my life!

525
00:44:18,869 --> 00:44:20,369
What's wrong with you?

526
00:44:20,505 --> 00:44:22,280
Considering all 
the money you give them,

527
00:44:22,427 --> 00:44:24,750
you could certainly
help me out this once.

528
00:44:24,850 --> 00:44:26,924
Ohh Ohh... Careful what you say!

529
00:44:27,034 --> 00:44:28,810
I'll beg, if necessary.

530
00:44:28,903 --> 00:44:30,596
Don't abandon me!

531
00:44:30,695 --> 00:44:34,282
- Chairman...
- This won't do, let's just...

532
00:44:37,855 --> 00:44:39,948
Stop... Fellas!

533
00:44:41,402 --> 00:44:43,325
I'll do whatever you ask me.

534
00:44:43,501 --> 00:44:45,248
Should I take off 
my clothes and dance for you?

535
00:44:45,454 --> 00:44:47,466
Or want me to bark like a mutt?

536
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:56,527
Chairman Hong...

537
00:45:05,825 --> 00:45:07,732
Look, Chairman Hong.

538
00:45:12,404 --> 00:45:16,804
In case you really haven't gone crazy,

539
00:45:17,135 --> 00:45:20,453
listen well to my very last offer.

540
00:45:21,182 --> 00:45:27,491
Do you at least have
a copy of that account?

541
00:45:29,081 --> 00:45:30,671
Give it to me.

542
00:45:30,910 --> 00:45:37,217
Then, I can certainly give you
enough for you and your wife...

543
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:39,522
to go live overseas.

544
00:45:40,643 --> 00:45:42,381
How about it?

545
00:45:42,599 --> 00:45:44,846
Will you give it to me?

546
00:45:45,452 --> 00:45:47,397
Chairman Hong!

547
00:45:58,259 --> 00:46:00,761
You son of a bitch...

548
00:46:01,365 --> 00:46:03,460
Out of the way!

549
00:47:05,416 --> 00:47:06,995
<i>It's me.</i>

550
00:47:08,714 --> 00:47:12,812
Seems like KCIA agents 
came here today.

551
00:47:12,934 --> 00:47:17,071
<i>Jo Pilyeon started 
suspecting your housemaid.</i>

552
00:47:18,439 --> 00:47:22,003
Thankfully, I was able to volunteer 
to spy on her, so don't worry too much.

553
00:47:22,126 --> 00:47:25,589
<i>How much longer do I
have to pretend like this?</i>

554
00:47:26,261 --> 00:47:28,030
Let's not rush things.

555
00:47:28,284 --> 00:47:30,409
The right opportunity will soon come.

556
00:47:31,561 --> 00:47:34,131
The moment Jo Pilyeon
stops suspecting you...

557
00:47:35,067 --> 00:47:38,106
is when we'll reveal
that account to the world.

558
00:48:19,579 --> 00:48:21,165
It's trouble.

559
00:48:21,448 --> 00:48:25,824
Jo Pilyeon sent his men
to search that maid's house.

560
00:48:33,216 --> 00:48:35,470
I don't think it's here.

561
00:48:35,745 --> 00:48:38,452
Search the kitchen and
then start from scratch!

562
00:48:38,628 --> 00:48:39,956
Yes.

563
00:48:50,215 --> 00:48:52,405
How did it go?
Did you find it?

564
00:48:52,544 --> 00:48:53,695
It's not there.

565
00:48:53,789 --> 00:48:55,070
It's not?!

566
00:48:55,167 --> 00:48:56,007
No.

567
00:48:56,106 --> 00:48:58,907
I don't think that maid is involved.

568
00:48:59,813 --> 00:49:03,856
Then, who could possibly have it?

569
00:49:04,416 --> 00:49:08,520
Isn't there a chance there
might be no copy to begin with?

570
00:49:09,642 --> 00:49:11,121
Nah.

571
00:49:11,438 --> 00:49:13,723
There is no way.

572
00:49:28,133 --> 00:49:28,983
Thank you.

573
00:49:29,061 --> 00:49:30,364
Go.

574
00:49:30,817 --> 00:49:32,829
All right!

575
00:49:55,208 --> 00:49:58,277
- See you tomorrow.
- See you.

576
00:50:03,663 --> 00:50:06,461
Last stop.
Aren't you leaving?

577
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,050
Last stop!

578
00:50:25,501 --> 00:50:27,029
What is this...

579
00:50:27,292 --> 00:50:29,605
Give me the ticket and leave.

580
00:50:30,042 --> 00:50:32,994
Ahh... Where did the ticket go?!

581
00:50:34,535 --> 00:50:38,262
You ride the bus all day,
and don't even have a ticket?

582
00:50:38,366 --> 00:50:40,542
Did I throw it away earlier on?

583
00:50:40,986 --> 00:50:42,847
I can bring it tomorrow, right?

584
00:50:44,277 --> 00:50:45,987
Tomorrow.

585
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:05,738
Look.

586
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:07,591
Are you going to keep this up?

587
00:51:07,813 --> 00:51:09,760
Let's just have a talk for an hour.

588
00:51:10,007 --> 00:51:11,508
I said I have nothing to talk about.

589
00:51:11,601 --> 00:51:13,532
Then, I'm not giving up, either.

590
00:51:14,547 --> 00:51:17,128
Do as you wish, then.

591
00:51:18,767 --> 00:51:24,190
Also, try to freeload again,
and I'll report you to the police.

592
00:51:40,106 --> 00:51:41,523
What's the matter?

593
00:51:41,597 --> 00:51:44,249
It must have been a thief.

594
00:51:44,396 --> 00:51:45,900
I shouldn't just stay here...

595
00:51:45,999 --> 00:51:47,350
Where are you going?

596
00:51:47,431 --> 00:51:48,652
I'll call the police.

597
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:52,192
This was no thief.

598
00:51:52,284 --> 00:51:53,899
What?

599
00:51:54,718 --> 00:51:56,788
Look at these footsteps.

600
00:51:57,897 --> 00:52:00,375
There were at least two of them.

601
00:52:06,377 --> 00:52:08,041
The account.

602
00:52:09,138 --> 00:52:11,547
You have it, right?

603
00:52:13,356 --> 00:52:15,824
Look if it's still there.

604
00:52:20,729 --> 00:52:23,219
What are you waiting for? 
Look for it.

605
00:52:23,983 --> 00:52:27,022
There is no such thing here.

606
00:52:27,169 --> 00:52:28,243
Look, young lady.

607
00:52:28,354 --> 00:52:29,925
I said there's none,
so hurry up and leave.

608
00:52:30,024 --> 00:52:35,010
Chairman Hong is trying to 
reveal that account.

609
00:52:35,107 --> 00:52:38,695
If he does, he won't survive.
Do you understand?

610
00:52:40,994 --> 00:52:45,203
If you really care about him,
give me that account.

611
00:52:45,516 --> 00:52:48,161
I said I don't know.
Leave.

612
00:52:48,604 --> 00:52:51,305
Before I start screaming,
get out of here!

613
00:53:15,511 --> 00:53:17,688
My shoes...

614
00:53:21,941 --> 00:53:24,089
My shoes...

615
00:53:44,887 --> 00:53:47,427
Chief Jo, I suppose?

616
00:53:47,532 --> 00:53:49,535
Your mother called me.

617
00:53:49,623 --> 00:53:52,705
She told me to prepare a
special ring for your engagement.

618
00:53:52,791 --> 00:53:53,556
Yes.

619
00:53:53,679 --> 00:53:57,106
We have a unique model
from an Italian designer.

620
00:53:57,229 --> 00:53:58,868
I'll show you that.

621
00:53:59,016 --> 00:54:01,907
Just give me anything you have.

622
00:54:03,584 --> 00:54:06,369
As long as it fits my finger, that'll do.

623
00:54:07,554 --> 00:54:09,389
This would be fine.

624
00:54:10,658 --> 00:54:13,711
Still, wouldn't you like 
to look at what I prepared?

625
00:54:13,821 --> 00:54:15,375
Let's have this.

626
00:54:32,728 --> 00:54:34,392
How does she look?

627
00:54:34,762 --> 00:54:37,449
Beautiful, isn't it?

628
00:54:38,645 --> 00:54:40,925
Yes. I like it.

629
00:54:41,171 --> 00:54:42,624
I'll choose this one.

630
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:44,916
Show me another model.

631
00:54:45,225 --> 00:54:49,736
But seems like the groom likes it...

632
00:54:50,056 --> 00:54:51,313
But I don't.

633
00:54:51,412 --> 00:54:53,199
I'll choose something else.

634
00:55:01,017 --> 00:55:03,660
He looks great.

635
00:55:03,821 --> 00:55:07,345
If you want to try out other models, 
I can leave, can't I?

636
00:55:20,608 --> 00:55:22,112
People here know me.

637
00:55:22,235 --> 00:55:25,904
Walked all day long, so my feet hurt.

638
00:55:28,489 --> 00:55:29,602
Why?

639
00:55:29,799 --> 00:55:31,204
Am I embarrassing you?

640
00:55:31,364 --> 00:55:33,953
Sit somewhere else, then.

641
00:55:40,786 --> 00:55:42,512
What are you doing?

642
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:46,074
Just stay put.

643
00:55:46,844 --> 00:55:49,463
All the fatigue 
will go away in a moment.

644
00:55:51,154 --> 00:55:52,412
People are looking!

645
00:55:52,522 --> 00:55:54,988
Not doing this to be nice.

646
00:55:57,009 --> 00:55:58,796
Our circle, it's a small world.

647
00:55:59,326 --> 00:56:03,119
Want to advertise to everyone that
it's just a loveless contract marriage?

648
00:56:06,804 --> 00:56:09,134
It will be hard for us, from now on,

649
00:56:10,009 --> 00:56:13,238
since we'll have to pretend we're
the happiest people in the world.

650
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:17,228
If acting as if 
you love me is too hard,

651
00:56:18,818 --> 00:56:21,591
just accept the love 
that I show for you.

652
00:56:22,237 --> 00:56:24,426
Will be much easier that way.

653
00:56:26,386 --> 00:56:30,885
I couldn't care less 
about what other people think.

654
00:56:45,628 --> 00:56:47,514
<i>You're quite busy these days.</i>

655
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:53,430
Looking for Chairman Hong's 
account, right?

656
00:56:53,973 --> 00:56:56,475
I'll have to do that myself.

657
00:56:56,721 --> 00:56:57,398
What?

658
00:56:57,516 --> 00:56:59,614
Get my hands on that account.

659
00:56:59,710 --> 00:57:01,343
Just leave it to me.

660
00:57:01,503 --> 00:57:02,600
And why?

661
00:57:03,611 --> 00:57:05,950
So you can continue
receiving all the praise?

662
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:08,179
- It's not that...
- If it's not, then what is it?

663
00:57:08,290 --> 00:57:10,085
I'm, what, in the way?

664
00:57:10,193 --> 00:57:13,803
While Jeongyeon and Minwoo
are talking about engagement,

665
00:57:13,914 --> 00:57:17,217
shouldn't I attract my father's
attention with something?

666
00:57:17,316 --> 00:57:19,337
- Listen...
- Spare me the excuses,

667
00:57:19,525 --> 00:57:22,801
and if you find any good lead,
report to me immediately.

668
00:57:23,454 --> 00:57:25,234
I'll come get it myself.

669
00:57:25,385 --> 00:57:26,766
Got it?

670
00:57:30,907 --> 00:57:32,867
Aww... That little...

671
00:57:33,015 --> 00:57:35,611
Why don't you just leave it to him?

672
00:57:35,763 --> 00:57:37,936
So he can go out there and get shot.

673
00:57:39,807 --> 00:57:44,000
Are you just going to keep
following that housemaid?

674
00:57:44,202 --> 00:57:45,778
That's the only option we have now.

675
00:57:45,861 --> 00:57:49,396
You're not even sure she has it.

676
00:57:58,611 --> 00:58:05,333
<i>{\a6}~ Little Women by Kwon Taesu & Kim Sehwa ~</i>

677
00:57:58,611 --> 00:58:05,333
When did we meet each other,

678
00:58:05,542 --> 00:58:12,383
And when did we break up?

679
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:20,606
Both loving each other and breaking up 
was nothing but suffering...

680
00:58:20,692 --> 00:58:24,920
Wow... I envy her...

681
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:27,705
Should have become a singer.

682
00:58:29,283 --> 00:58:32,251
Hey, what are you doing?
Bring the drinks.

683
00:58:32,461 --> 00:58:33,964
Yes...

684
00:58:38,857 --> 00:58:40,879
Hey... My bottle.

685
00:58:41,421 --> 00:58:43,405
My bottle!

Currently, Hwang Taeseop holds
sixty percent of the company's shares...

either firsthand or through his family.

688
00:58:54,989 --> 00:58:59,759

<i>I'm Manbo Construction's 
Hwang Taeseop.</i>

691
00:59:18,795 --> 00:59:21,272
I've heard a lot about you.

692
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:26,338
Is she your daughter?

693
00:59:27,169 --> 00:59:28,513
Yes.

694
00:59:29,022 --> 00:59:30,756
Introduce yourself.

695
00:59:32,568 --> 00:59:36,795
Nice to meet you,
my name is Hwang Jeongyeon.

696
00:59:38,017 --> 00:59:41,997
I'm in charge of 
the subway construction.

697
00:59:42,170 --> 00:59:45,868
I'd need some financial
help to cover expenses...

698
00:59:45,978 --> 00:59:49,811
If it's Manbo Construction,
I certainly should help you out.

699
00:59:50,243 --> 00:59:53,374
But I trust you know our conditions?

700
00:59:53,498 --> 00:59:55,790
Yes.
I know.

701
00:59:55,950 --> 01:00:00,513
- It's me.
- Ohh... Come on in.

702
01:00:34,593 --> 01:00:37,181
The contract?

703
01:00:38,512 --> 01:00:40,201
Here it is.

704
01:00:45,735 --> 01:00:47,337
Dad.

705
01:00:56,951 --> 01:01:00,907
Read it thoroughly, and then sign it.

706
01:01:01,129 --> 01:01:02,710
Yes.

707
01:01:08,873 --> 01:01:11,868
You own the Royal Club, right?

708
01:01:13,950 --> 01:01:15,701
<i>Remember me?</i>

709
01:01:15,911 --> 01:01:18,991
We met at the club, a while ago.

710
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:25,980
Really? I'm sorry.

711
01:01:26,830 --> 01:01:29,747
I can't remember all my customers.

712
01:01:30,141 --> 01:01:32,236
I see.

713
01:01:41,702 --> 01:01:45,535
<i>The more I think about it,
they look too much alike.</i>

714
01:01:45,682 --> 01:01:51,032
<i>How could she look so much
like Jeongyeon's late mother...</i>

715
01:01:51,426 --> 01:01:53,497
<i>Do you know her?</i>

716
01:01:53,679 --> 01:01:55,111
Is she dead?

717
01:01:55,331 --> 01:02:00,468
I think it'll be hard 
for her to survive the night.

718
01:02:14,725 --> 01:02:15,785
Dad.

719
01:02:15,933 --> 01:02:18,731
Nah... It's impossible.

720
01:02:18,916 --> 01:02:22,921
I saw her dead.

721
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:26,987
What did you just say?

722
01:02:27,345 --> 01:02:30,340
- What?
- You said something.

723
01:02:30,607 --> 01:02:33,988
I did?! And when?

724
01:02:34,358 --> 01:02:36,318
Is anything the matter?

725
01:02:36,483 --> 01:02:39,136
Nah, I'm fine.

726
01:02:39,214 --> 01:02:41,881
I'm perfectly fine...

727
01:03:16,935 --> 01:03:21,347
Oppa... You'll come today, right?

728
01:04:08,029 --> 01:04:08,744
Halmeoni!

729
01:04:08,830 --> 01:04:10,975
Ohh... You're here?

730
01:04:11,675 --> 01:04:12,676
Want some cakes?

731
01:04:12,774 --> 01:04:14,302
I had breakfast already.

732
01:04:14,413 --> 01:04:16,480
<i>Ohh... You did?</i>

733
01:04:16,611 --> 01:04:18,850
- Have you been doing well?
- Yes.

734
01:04:18,961 --> 01:04:21,377
- It's hot, isn't it?
- It sure is.

735
01:04:21,845 --> 01:04:23,830

looking for you, the other day.

What?!

740
01:04:43,781 --> 01:04:46,582
I'm sure he'll come today.

741
01:04:46,755 --> 01:04:51,857
I told him you come here
every last day of the month.

742
01:04:53,116 --> 01:04:54,285
Must be happy...

01:05:37,211 --> 01:05:38,825
<i>Put them on.</i>

<i>Miju.</i>

748
01:05:42,675 --> 01:05:45,756
Will you sing Oppa a song?

01:05:46,175 --> 01:05:47,546

Yeah.

751
01:05:49,084 --> 01:05:52,535
Fine, since you 
even bought me shoes.
