Episode 54

4
00:00:07,404 --> 00:00:10,480
Minister Kwon had a lot to say about you.

5
00:00:10,581 --> 00:00:12,967
I'll make sure we can
meet over dinner soon.

6
00:00:13,068 --> 00:00:15,527
Yes. Take care.

7
00:00:15,617 --> 00:00:18,099
You as well.

8
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:20,588
Chief Prosecutor.

9
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,281
Why, is anything the matter?

10
00:00:24,984 --> 00:00:28,710
Lee Gangmo is asking
to meet Congressman Jo.

11
00:00:28,821 --> 00:00:30,208
Me?

12
00:00:30,301 --> 00:00:32,175
What are you, crazy?

13
00:00:32,536 --> 00:00:35,420
- How can you agree to that...
- No need to blame him.

14
00:00:36,714 --> 00:00:39,201
He looks like a newcomer.

15
00:00:39,962 --> 00:00:42,296
I'll get going.

16
00:00:43,758 --> 00:00:46,158
He claimed he has a certain account.

17
00:00:49,552 --> 00:00:50,935
An account?

18
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,091
What is that supposed to mean?

19
00:01:08,385 --> 00:01:10,703
You can leave us alone.

20
00:01:17,006 --> 00:01:18,232
Quite daring.

21
00:01:18,362 --> 00:01:20,906
Trying to blackmail me in a place like this.

22
00:01:21,412 --> 00:01:26,774
Thought it wouldn't be too bad
a burial spot for the both of us.

23
00:01:26,867 --> 00:01:29,785
I'm sure this will create some
headaches, but I won't die over it.

24
00:01:29,861 --> 00:01:31,910
Even if this had been the Blue House.

25
00:01:34,686 --> 00:01:36,900
So you have an account?

26
00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:41,472
Then, must we start
negotiations from scratch?

27
00:01:41,644 --> 00:01:44,577
Your company for that account.

28
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,364
Did he tell you I
had that account on me?

29
00:01:50,391 --> 00:01:55,857
I called you here to find
out who did this to me...

30
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:59,853
You never betray
my expectations, do you?

31
00:02:00,054 --> 00:02:02,642
But unless you give me that account,

32
00:02:03,122 --> 00:02:06,585
whatever those expectations
might be, I will be sure to defy them.

33
00:02:06,676 --> 00:02:11,667
Even if I was in possession of
that account, I'd never use it for this.

34
00:02:11,897 --> 00:02:18,769
I'd keep it safe, and only use it
once the company goes bankrupt.

35
00:02:19,034 --> 00:02:21,011
Wouldn't that make for
much more effective blackmail?

36
00:02:21,155 --> 00:02:22,276
Sure.

37
00:02:22,653 --> 00:02:26,381
Blackmail would need to benefit you.

38
00:02:26,903 --> 00:02:27,981
Go ahead.

39
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,562
I might be curious,

40
00:02:29,677 --> 00:02:32,969
but I'll first worry about making
Hangang Construction go belly up.

41
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,600
But if you do try,

42
00:02:36,218 --> 00:02:41,160
I suggest you take this to the very end.

43
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:45,358
Because should you leave
even a single spoon behind,

44
00:02:45,876 --> 00:02:51,353
I'll use that to go at your throat.

45
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:12,920
So you used to laugh
a lot before joining politics?

46
00:03:13,021 --> 00:03:14,321
I sure did.

47
00:03:14,413 --> 00:03:16,169
I'd always prance around
laughing for no apparent reason,

48
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:19,317
so people called me Smile Mask.

49
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:25,930
So I guess I found your
elixir of eternal youth.

50
00:03:26,045 --> 00:03:28,034
Really? And what would that be?

51
00:03:28,112 --> 00:03:31,635
Getting kicked out of congress.

52
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:33,782
What? Kicked out?!

53
00:03:34,556 --> 00:03:35,605
That's right.

54
00:03:35,692 --> 00:03:40,541
Quitting politics would
sure help me live longer!

55
00:03:41,528 --> 00:03:43,821
Let me pour you a drink, Deputy.

56
00:03:44,052 --> 00:03:46,637
Ahh... Y.... Yes...

57
00:03:58,016 --> 00:03:59,949
I'm going there as we speak.

58
00:04:00,042 --> 00:04:01,956
Who did you see?

59
00:04:02,962 --> 00:04:05,061
I'll be there in a moment.

60
00:04:47,934 --> 00:04:51,895
Better be careful
about that Cha Soojeong.

61
00:04:53,036 --> 00:04:57,272
You saw how she
was acting a little different today.

62
00:04:57,559 --> 00:05:02,648
I'm sure she was
approaching you on purpose.

63
00:05:05,408 --> 00:05:10,569
And why... Why would Soojeong
approach an old fart like me?

64
00:05:10,655 --> 00:05:13,185
So that's why it's strange.

65
00:05:13,372 --> 00:05:16,341
How naive... What's wrong with you?

66
00:05:16,866 --> 00:05:21,342
You and I are on the same
boat for the rest of our days.

67
00:05:21,646 --> 00:05:25,511
So if Miss Soojeong was approaching
you with ulterior motives,

68
00:05:25,684 --> 00:05:31,147
neither of us will have
anything to gain from that.

69
00:05:53,547 --> 00:05:56,466
Couldn't believe my eyes...

70
00:05:56,681 --> 00:05:58,550
It's you, all right.

71
00:05:58,737 --> 00:06:00,520
Did you drink?

72
00:06:00,965 --> 00:06:02,245
Yes...

73
00:06:02,878 --> 00:06:04,689
With whom?

74
00:06:11,615 --> 00:06:14,721
It's the very last favor I'll ask you.

75
00:06:15,873 --> 00:06:17,984
Please, stop this.

76
00:06:18,271 --> 00:06:19,939
What are you talking about?

77
00:06:20,303 --> 00:06:26,013
Leave my brother's company alone.

78
00:06:26,763 --> 00:06:29,049
Afraid it's a little too late for that.

79
00:06:30,141 --> 00:06:32,298
If you really want me to stop...

80
00:06:39,802 --> 00:06:42,959
I've heard they banned you from TV.

81
00:06:43,491 --> 00:06:44,785
If you want, I could help you with that.

82
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,510
No, thanks.

83
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,810
I don't need your help.

84
00:06:48,911 --> 00:06:52,864
I'm the only one who
can defeat my father.

85
00:06:52,993 --> 00:06:55,394
Is that really the case?

86
00:06:56,263 --> 00:07:01,395
Try to gain even more
power than your father, then.

87
00:07:01,524 --> 00:07:03,738
What are you trying to imply?

88
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:06,024
Gain even more power?

89
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,382
Just as you've heard.

90
00:07:10,564 --> 00:07:12,898
Ohh... Soojeong.

91
00:07:13,905 --> 00:07:16,089
Aigoo.... Chairman Jo.

92
00:07:16,183 --> 00:07:18,059
We see each other
quite often these days.

93
00:07:19,698 --> 00:07:22,257
I'll treat you to a drink later.

94
00:07:22,531 --> 00:07:24,326
I have company tonight.

95
00:07:24,586 --> 00:07:25,779
Sure.

96
00:07:25,966 --> 00:07:28,754
We'll have to get going as well.

97
00:07:29,378 --> 00:07:31,399
Deputy...

98
00:07:31,906 --> 00:07:32,779
Yes.

99
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:37,882
Actually, I can't handle liquor too well.

100
00:07:39,363 --> 00:07:40,332
Yes...

101
00:07:40,428 --> 00:07:42,871
I kind of suspected that myself.

102
00:07:43,043 --> 00:07:45,140
Buy me soju.

103
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:46,894
What?

104
00:07:50,056 --> 00:07:55,720
Of course I would have,
like, no reason to refuse...

105
00:08:13,403 --> 00:08:17,702
Why are you always so kind to me?

106
00:08:20,036 --> 00:08:24,516
I get flowers after every concert,
you send me supplements,

107
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:28,239
help me get invited to TV shows.

108
00:08:29,418 --> 00:08:31,767
Why do you do that?

109
00:08:33,522 --> 00:08:38,459
So I was asking the same question.

110
00:08:38,689 --> 00:08:40,500
To who?

111
00:08:41,435 --> 00:08:43,519
The mirror.

112
00:08:44,082 --> 00:08:45,331
What did it answer?

113
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,041
This is what it said.

114
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:49,899
"Ehh... You fool."

115
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,715
That was it.

116
00:08:55,054 --> 00:08:57,087
I'm just a foolish man, I guess.

117
00:08:57,825 --> 00:08:59,776
Would that answer be enough?

118
00:09:01,617 --> 00:09:02,910
Here...

119
00:09:03,212 --> 00:09:07,125
So now it's your turn to tell me.

120
00:09:08,116 --> 00:09:13,924
If we count all the people I've shaken
hands and spent time with in this line of work,

121
00:09:14,097 --> 00:09:17,116
it'd probably be enough to make a small city.

122
00:09:17,993 --> 00:09:22,788
I'm sure you had something to ask me.

123
00:09:23,205 --> 00:09:24,887
Don't you?

124
00:09:27,719 --> 00:09:31,931
Ohh... Are you... about to cry?

125
00:09:33,035 --> 00:09:34,735
Ahh... Nevermind, then.

126
00:09:34,993 --> 00:09:36,960
I'll stop asking.

127
00:09:37,917 --> 00:09:40,468
No crying, please.

128
00:09:41,546 --> 00:09:43,228
I apologize.

129
00:09:43,329 --> 00:09:45,989
I didn't mean to do this...

130
00:09:47,389 --> 00:09:52,888
But I see you don't like it.

131
00:09:53,866 --> 00:09:57,618
You hate seeing women cry, right?

132
00:09:57,776 --> 00:10:04,633
Yes... Because when women cry,
you must always grant their wishes.

133
00:10:06,214 --> 00:10:08,586
So that's why I told you not to cry.

134
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:13,050
I'm not going to listen to
wishes I might not be able to grant you.

135
00:10:50,378 --> 00:10:51,643
Now...

136
00:10:52,754 --> 00:10:55,467
I can find my way home by myself.

137
00:10:57,436 --> 00:10:59,753
Thank you for today.

138
00:11:04,221 --> 00:11:08,507
Are you just going to
go home empty-handed?

139
00:11:15,551 --> 00:11:20,302
You looked different tonight.

140
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:24,399
Just like someone who
gave up on herself.

141
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:34,272
You will have to be convincing.

142
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:41,417
Because depending on what you say,
I might decide not to see you again.

143
00:11:43,532 --> 00:11:50,090
I must have really disappointed you.

144
00:11:53,553 --> 00:11:55,855
I apologize.

145
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,737
Why does Jo Pilyeon...

146
00:12:00,116 --> 00:12:02,989
keep bothering you?

147
00:12:09,588 --> 00:12:11,543
So he got you banned from TV,

148
00:12:11,755 --> 00:12:17,437
and what else? Tell me
what he's been doing to you.

149
00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:21,906
And what about Jo Minwoo?

150
00:12:22,983 --> 00:12:25,227
Is he the man you love,

151
00:12:25,587 --> 00:12:28,577
or just a despicable
lowlife I should punish?

152
00:12:30,963 --> 00:12:33,249
Tell me, Soojeong.

153
00:12:36,976 --> 00:12:38,862
I'm sorry.

154
00:12:39,244 --> 00:12:41,924
I know how much
you hate seeing me cry...

155
00:12:44,534 --> 00:12:47,444
Be it a single teardrop or an entire bucket,

156
00:12:47,861 --> 00:12:52,274
you're still shedding tears before me.

157
00:12:52,806 --> 00:12:54,402
Cry all you want.

158
00:12:54,618 --> 00:12:58,197
Cry until you don't have a single tear left,

159
00:12:58,485 --> 00:13:00,656
and then tell me the truth.

160
00:13:02,195 --> 00:13:08,328
I'll grant all your wishes.

161
00:13:17,298 --> 00:13:20,777
- Hangang Construction 915 -
- Manbo Construction 2150 -

162
00:13:21,603 --> 00:13:22,716
Yes.

163
00:13:22,888 --> 00:13:25,620
Selling 12,000 Hangang shares?
Yes... Certainly.

164
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,020
Yes... Hangang Construction is
hitting the daily permissible low,

165
00:13:28,121 --> 00:13:30,392
since they're just
selling shares left and right.

166
00:13:30,507 --> 00:13:34,188
You're selling again?

167
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:39,153
We're a half hour before the closing bell,
but everyone is selling in droves.

168
00:13:39,924 --> 00:13:41,290
Yes, Chairman.

169
00:13:41,576 --> 00:13:44,162
Well... I don't think there
is anything else to see here.

170
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:46,552
And of course, they reached
the daily permissible low again.

171
00:13:46,724 --> 00:13:49,398
I guess by next week they'll
be worth less than toilet paper.

172
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:52,115
That's when we'll buy them.

173
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,914
Go ahead.

174
00:14:02,124 --> 00:14:04,209
Shall we begin?

175
00:14:17,103 --> 00:14:19,101
Yes, Taeyang Securities.

176
00:14:19,354 --> 00:14:22,939
What? You're going to buy
Hangang Construction shares?

177
00:14:23,098 --> 00:14:25,700
15,000 Hangang
Construction shares, then.

178
00:14:25,872 --> 00:14:29,922
20,000 shares?
Hangang Construction, right?

179
00:14:32,585 --> 00:14:35,040
- Hangang Construction 995 -

180
00:14:47,707 --> 00:14:49,519
Good job, everyone.

181
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:51,922
- Good job.
- Good job, everyone.

182
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:54,003
Thank you.

183
00:14:58,232 --> 00:15:00,307
Here you are, Director.

184
00:15:00,426 --> 00:15:03,790
We stopped shares from getting suspended,
and brought them back to the 1000 won mark.

185
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:07,608
Order something to eat for those people.

186
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,340
All right.

187
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,563
What is this?

188
00:15:17,671 --> 00:15:20,078
It's 100 won higher than yesterday!

189
00:15:20,184 --> 00:15:21,770
With twenty minutes before the closing bell,

190
00:15:21,871 --> 00:15:24,760
people just started buying shares nonstop.

191
00:15:25,331 --> 00:15:27,593
So someone must be scheming against us.

192
00:15:27,722 --> 00:15:29,131
What?

193
00:15:29,749 --> 00:15:32,176
President Lee is being investigated by prosecutors,

194
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,989
who would possibly buy those shares...

195
00:15:34,104 --> 00:15:37,639
Find out who bought those
Hangang Construction shares.

196
00:15:37,754 --> 00:15:40,068
All right, Chairman.

197
00:16:05,661 --> 00:16:08,242
- Hangang Construction 1058 (from 964) -

198
00:16:14,486 --> 00:16:15,962
- International Group -

199
00:16:18,058 --> 00:16:21,896
- Left (Ailing Companies) Right (Viable Companies) -

200
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:30,944
- Hangang Construction -
(Ailing Companies)

201
00:16:31,303 --> 00:16:34,926
I guess we're pretty much done
selecting the list of ailing companies.

202
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:37,281
Thousands of lives are on the line here.

203
00:16:37,468 --> 00:16:39,932
How about we give this data another read?

204
00:16:40,025 --> 00:16:44,613
Have you forgotten that our deadline for
reporting this to the president is around the corner?

205
00:16:46,576 --> 00:16:49,199
But about Hangang Construction.

206
00:16:49,443 --> 00:16:52,114
Their boiler is still under development.

207
00:16:52,224 --> 00:16:55,027
Should the results defy all expectations,

208
00:16:55,301 --> 00:16:57,860
wouldn't it be unfair?

209
00:16:59,398 --> 00:17:06,169
So, what, are you going to make the president
wait just because of Hangang Construction?

210
00:17:06,801 --> 00:17:08,285
I wasn't necessarily suggesting that.

211
00:17:08,372 --> 00:17:10,226
Thank you for your hard work.

212
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:14,065
The classification is done,
so leave the rest to me.

213
00:17:14,237 --> 00:17:15,862
Jaechun!

214
00:17:20,893 --> 00:17:21,856
Were you looking for me, Congressman?

215
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:24,640
Take this to my office.

216
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:27,599
I'm telling you just in case.

217
00:17:28,045 --> 00:17:30,733
When this list is published,

218
00:17:31,078 --> 00:17:34,902
there will be pandemonium
in the financial world.

219
00:17:35,348 --> 00:17:38,280
Through mergers and acquisitions,
some will go bankrupt,

220
00:17:38,453 --> 00:17:41,084
others will grow into huge dinosaurs.

221
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,163
And?

222
00:17:42,306 --> 00:17:45,469
I set my sights on two players.

223
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,539
The private lending market,

224
00:17:48,459 --> 00:17:50,587
and Manbo Construction.

225
00:17:51,628 --> 00:17:57,790
Should any of them use
this list to gain an unfair advantage,

226
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:03,111
I will be forced to accuse you of
accumulating wealth through illicit means.

227
00:18:03,413 --> 00:18:07,783
That overzealous solicitude of
yours seems to be getting quite serious.

228
00:18:07,985 --> 00:18:11,449
Was just going on
record for your own sake.

229
00:18:11,622 --> 00:18:13,336
Don't take it the wrong way.

230
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,463
What are you waiting
for? Take this box!

231
00:18:15,732 --> 00:18:17,433
Yes, Sir.

232
00:18:36,859 --> 00:18:37,894
Jaechun.

233
00:18:38,009 --> 00:18:40,827
I can't stand that old fart any longer.

234
00:18:40,985 --> 00:18:43,127
I can only pray he'll live a long life,

235
00:18:43,227 --> 00:18:49,213
so that when the time comes, I can
trample on him every step of the way.

236
00:19:15,749 --> 00:19:17,064
Suyeon...

237
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:18,935
It was hard, wasn't it?

238
00:19:19,044 --> 00:19:21,264
How did you find
out I'd be released now?

239
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:22,570
I didn't.

240
00:19:22,682 --> 00:19:26,361
I didn't, so I've
been waiting all day here.

241
00:19:27,862 --> 00:19:29,084
You're hungry, aren't you?

242
00:19:29,286 --> 00:19:32,164
Let's go have something to eat.

243
00:19:36,991 --> 00:19:39,363
There he is.

244
00:19:46,848 --> 00:19:47,888
Don't stop.

245
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:49,906
Just go, Jina.

246
00:20:04,928 --> 00:20:09,959
She's really something...
Why does she keep hanging around him?

247
00:20:16,143 --> 00:20:19,464
My father was really worried about you.

248
00:20:19,724 --> 00:20:21,349
I see.

249
00:20:22,005 --> 00:20:24,616
Is Chairman Cheon doing well?

250
00:20:25,115 --> 00:20:30,276
He's a bit disappointed
because you never call him.

251
00:20:30,882 --> 00:20:32,820
Won't you come by our
house, one of these days?

252
00:20:32,936 --> 00:20:35,336
It would make my father really happy.

253
00:20:35,814 --> 00:20:38,044
Let me ask you something.

254
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,032
By any chance, did you...

255
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,813
Did I what?

256
00:20:47,201 --> 00:20:49,085
Go ahead and say it.

257
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:53,772
Did you buy those Hangang
Construction shares?

258
00:20:54,267 --> 00:20:56,236
Shares?

259
00:20:57,544 --> 00:21:00,338
I'm not really into that stuff.

260
00:21:01,242 --> 00:21:05,327
If you don't have any appetite,
shall we just go for a drink?

261
00:21:05,452 --> 00:21:07,219
I know this great place...

262
00:21:07,406 --> 00:21:11,574
No, I think I'll have
to go back to my office.

263
00:21:11,776 --> 00:21:13,472
You're just going?

264
00:21:13,573 --> 00:21:15,183
I'm sorry, Suyeon.

265
00:21:15,582 --> 00:21:17,785
I have something to do.

266
00:21:53,438 --> 00:21:54,891
- Hangang Construction 1100 -

267
00:21:58,495 --> 00:22:00,820
- Current Price 1320 won -

268
00:22:00,937 --> 00:22:02,447
- Hangang Construction 1430 -

269
00:22:14,443 --> 00:22:17,384
Yes... Yes.
All right.

270
00:22:24,045 --> 00:22:25,714
Gangmo...

271
00:22:26,549 --> 00:22:28,330
They were suspended...

272
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:32,777
Our shares were suspended
for excessive gains!

273
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,420
This is strange.

274
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,689
We haven't even finished our boiler,

275
00:22:47,876 --> 00:22:48,709
why is this happening?

276
00:22:48,853 --> 00:22:49,870
Why do you think?

277
00:22:49,957 --> 00:22:53,467
Rumors that we'd make a
killer boiler started spreading.

278
00:22:55,869 --> 00:22:57,965
Did you find out who's
been buying our shares?

279
00:22:58,119 --> 00:23:01,413
That... There were too many
buyers to track them down.

280
00:23:01,525 --> 00:23:04,350
Unless someone made a concerted effort
to help us, this wouldn't have happened.

281
00:23:04,437 --> 00:23:05,184
Keep looking into it.

282
00:23:05,256 --> 00:23:06,924
Yes, I will, President.

283
00:23:19,152 --> 00:23:22,660
I knew it... My guess was right.

284
00:23:23,853 --> 00:23:28,942
You know, only big shots
would be capable of something like this.

285
00:23:33,514 --> 00:23:38,697
You seem to be investing in the
stock exchange quite significantly as of late.

286
00:23:38,812 --> 00:23:43,599
Ahh... So that's why you jumped on board?

287
00:23:44,232 --> 00:23:47,538
But of all companies, Hangang Construction?

288
00:23:47,768 --> 00:23:51,614
Isn't letting pride and competitive spirit
become your only reward a bit naive?

289
00:23:51,744 --> 00:23:58,040
When the target is someone
like you, any reward is fine.

290
00:23:59,595 --> 00:24:03,633
To be really honest, I never
really thought of you as an ally,

291
00:24:03,791 --> 00:24:06,307
but neither did I ever consider you a foe.

292
00:24:06,394 --> 00:24:10,577
I'd at least have to feel a little
intimidated for that to be the case.

293
00:24:10,692 --> 00:24:12,892
I see we have different views.

294
00:24:14,617 --> 00:24:18,599
You've really made a name for yourself.

295
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:21,531
And I can't stand that.

296
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:27,419
A loan shark who would grovel
at Baekpa's feet for pocket money...

297
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:29,978
is now acting like a businessman.

298
00:24:31,293 --> 00:24:33,710
It just feels phony to me.

299
00:24:34,909 --> 00:24:38,057
Stop giving me that haughty
crap and listen well.

300
00:24:38,801 --> 00:24:42,136
You choosing to bring this
fight to the stock exchange...

301
00:24:42,352 --> 00:24:45,278
is like a monkey
trying to eat with a fork.

302
00:24:45,414 --> 00:24:47,268
Am I making myself clear?

303
00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:51,581
It's the very last chance I'll give you.

304
00:24:51,831 --> 00:24:54,120
Leave me the rest of the
areas under your control,

305
00:24:54,293 --> 00:24:56,478
and get out of this business.

306
00:24:58,174 --> 00:25:00,949
I'll promise you right here.

307
00:25:02,705 --> 00:25:07,174
I will make sure you can call it quits
sooner than you can imagine.

308
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:10,793
Better remember
my words, Noh Gapsoo.

309
00:25:20,348 --> 00:25:26,003
I guess the stock market
will be a good place for you to get buried.

310
00:25:29,761 --> 00:25:32,299
These companies have been confirmed.

311
00:25:37,681 --> 00:25:40,884
The list will be published in a week.

312
00:25:40,989 --> 00:25:44,904
So start putting all those
M&As in motion before then.

313
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:48,350
So I can stop worrying
about Hangang Construction.

314
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:51,890
Don't let your guard down until
the official announcement is made.

315
00:25:52,063 --> 00:25:55,398
That Lee Gangmo is backed by big names.

316
00:26:05,344 --> 00:26:08,420
That's from the kindergarten Wooju frequents.

317
00:26:10,203 --> 00:26:11,439
Turn around.

318
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:12,805
What?

319
00:26:13,244 --> 00:26:14,959
Take me to Wooju.

320
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,664
Yes, Chairman.

321
00:26:38,484 --> 00:26:40,488
Daddy!

322
00:26:57,481 --> 00:26:59,321
Have you been well?

323
00:26:59,609 --> 00:27:03,037
I missed you, Daddy.

324
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:06,962
What do you want to do today?

325
00:27:07,091 --> 00:27:10,599
I want to go to the toy shop.

326
00:27:10,757 --> 00:27:12,410
Again?

327
00:27:38,216 --> 00:27:40,696
Wow! I won!

328
00:27:40,811 --> 00:27:42,559
Wooju!

329
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,315
Come and get me!

330
00:28:13,638 --> 00:28:15,219
Wooju.

331
00:28:16,383 --> 00:28:18,080
Time to go now.

332
00:28:18,224 --> 00:28:19,388
Daddy...

333
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:23,027
Come see me again tomorrow.

334
00:28:26,646 --> 00:28:29,020
I can't come anymore.

335
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:30,832
Why?

336
00:28:33,331 --> 00:28:35,173
Because I...

337
00:28:39,357 --> 00:28:41,949
am not your father.

338
00:28:50,835 --> 00:28:52,417
Take him inside.

339
00:28:52,702 --> 00:28:54,312
Yes.

340
00:28:55,237 --> 00:28:58,931
Wooju... Let's go.

341
00:29:09,613 --> 00:29:14,304
Daddy... Don't... go...

342
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:31,001
Daddy...

343
00:29:31,073 --> 00:29:35,774
Don't go...

344
00:29:59,228 --> 00:30:00,599
This is serious, Congressman.

345
00:30:00,724 --> 00:30:01,757
Serious?

346
00:30:01,872 --> 00:30:05,437
It finally happened.

347
00:30:07,823 --> 00:30:09,975
- Agents Involved with Death
by Torture Case Arrested -

348
00:30:10,143 --> 00:30:14,857
- On January 14, 1987, SNU student and
democratic activist Park Jongcheol... -

349
00:30:15,001 --> 00:30:19,461
- passed away after going through
electroshock and drowning torture, -

350
00:30:19,568 --> 00:30:23,658
- which proved to be the spark igniting
the June (87) Democracy Movement, -

351
00:30:23,843 --> 00:30:27,854
- with students raising against
the Jeon Duhwan junta's claims that... -

352
00:30:27,997 --> 00:30:31,464
- direct presidential
elections were unconstitutional. -

353
00:30:32,816 --> 00:30:40,550
- This led to Korea's first ever direct
elections, and to the end of the 5th Republic. -

354
00:30:50,694 --> 00:30:54,221
Hey... Will you stop typing?

355
00:30:54,523 --> 00:30:56,650
I'm all done.

356
00:30:56,791 --> 00:30:58,618
I'll go get this report examined,

357
00:30:58,728 --> 00:31:01,164
so don't you even think of running away.

358
00:31:05,142 --> 00:31:08,448
Is there anything problematic
in the reports she's writing?

359
00:31:08,554 --> 00:31:13,150
I took a look the other day, and it
was just basic daily itinerary and stuff.

360
00:31:14,767 --> 00:31:21,613
That torture accident is
going to seriously ignite the situation.

361
00:31:21,739 --> 00:31:24,923
When do you plan to reveal the account?

362
00:31:25,045 --> 00:31:27,975
We'll first observe how
the situation evolves.

363
00:31:28,255 --> 00:31:30,154
What's for sure...

364
00:31:31,098 --> 00:31:34,512
is that this regime is
surviving on borrowed time.

365
00:31:35,259 --> 00:31:37,502
And Jo Pilyeon's fortunes...

366
00:31:38,275 --> 00:31:42,246
will face the very same fate.

367
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:50,514
That's it.

368
00:31:50,614 --> 00:31:53,102
That's how you write a report.

369
00:31:53,762 --> 00:31:55,258
Good job.

370
00:31:55,607 --> 00:31:57,270
You can go.

371
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,390
See you tomorrow.

372
00:32:00,864 --> 00:32:04,099
Ahh... I'll work even harder.

373
00:32:08,789 --> 00:32:12,331
You organized all the reports
she's been writing, right?

374
00:32:12,427 --> 00:32:13,952
Yes, Chief.

375
00:32:14,828 --> 00:32:17,255
This is starting to smell.

376
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:20,734
I'm sure something is up.

377
00:32:32,055 --> 00:32:37,518
Does that torture case
have anything to do with you?

378
00:32:38,804 --> 00:32:44,598
From what I hear, the first informer
came from the ruling party.

379
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:46,768
Is this the time to be worrying about that?

380
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:53,310
Shouldn't we know what's going
on between you and the opposition?

381
00:32:53,563 --> 00:32:57,184
You don't need to know now.

382
00:32:58,728 --> 00:33:01,042
I don't?!

383
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,716
You just wait.

384
00:33:03,903 --> 00:33:08,058
The direct elections that congress
could not bring into fruition...

385
00:33:08,589 --> 00:33:12,874
will likely be achieved by our people themselves.

386
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:14,829
So?

387
00:33:16,654 --> 00:33:19,659
First you send out the
hounds on a hunting spree,

388
00:33:20,096 --> 00:33:24,403
and with the hare in your
hands, no need for them anymore?

389
00:33:25,932 --> 00:33:32,848
Didn't you just answer the call
of duty from the very start?

390
00:33:37,535 --> 00:33:42,178
This wouldn't have been
possible without your efforts.

391
00:33:43,654 --> 00:33:49,124
If I only could, I'd go out on
the street and throw rocks as well.

392
00:33:49,282 --> 00:33:54,385
Our candidate would like to see you.

393
00:33:55,392 --> 00:33:58,676
I'm sure he's busy preparing
the presidential elections...

394
00:33:58,779 --> 00:34:04,106
All the more reason why he'd
need people like you by his side.

395
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,958
What are you trying to say?

396
00:34:08,225 --> 00:34:10,517
At the next general elections,

397
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:15,319
we'd like to recommend
you for a seat in congress.

398
00:34:16,282 --> 00:34:18,424
Ahh... I see...

399
00:34:18,966 --> 00:34:21,227
Help us out, Chairman Hwang.

400
00:34:21,757 --> 00:34:25,511
Shouldn't we obtain those direct elections...

401
00:34:25,723 --> 00:34:28,947
and put an end to this dictatorship?

402
00:34:31,525 --> 00:34:38,520
I will be happy to devote my
insignificant life for this great cause.

403
00:34:43,091 --> 00:34:46,527
{\a6}"Did he really hit the
desk and suddenly die?"

404
00:34:44,428 --> 00:34:46,714
What the hell are you people about?

405
00:34:47,116 --> 00:34:49,576
How could you let this happen?

406
00:34:49,698 --> 00:34:51,668
You shouldn't blame it all on us.

407
00:34:51,788 --> 00:34:53,528
Think you politicians' hands are clean?

408
00:34:53,686 --> 00:34:54,937
Look, Chief Oh...

409
00:34:55,066 --> 00:34:57,927
I have no time to waste arguing with you.

410
00:34:58,128 --> 00:34:59,294
What is this?

411
00:34:59,403 --> 00:35:03,045
The reports from the mole
we sent to Lee Seongmo's office.

412
00:35:07,859 --> 00:35:11,137
You know Yoo Chanseong, right?

413
00:35:11,468 --> 00:35:13,092
According to those reports,

414
00:35:13,265 --> 00:35:17,561
this Yoo Chanseong once
wrote a report about the torture case.

415
00:35:17,669 --> 00:35:21,679
Of course, we never ordered him to do so.

416
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:27,957
Then, Lee Seongmo has to be behind this.

417
00:35:28,464 --> 00:35:31,235
Are you suspecting him again?

418
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:34,611
Yoo Chanseong is like
Lee Seongmo's alter ego.

419
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,068
There is no way he could
have plotted this on his own.

420
00:35:37,155 --> 00:35:42,457
Still, how can we just punish him
for having written a mere report?

421
00:35:42,566 --> 00:35:44,739
- Jaechun.
- Yes, Congressman.

422
00:35:44,844 --> 00:35:49,144
Follow Chief Oh, and get
Yoo Chanseong's full records.

423
00:35:49,762 --> 00:35:51,273
All right.

424
00:35:51,429 --> 00:36:00,989
I'll finally start to get a hold of
who this invisible thorn in my side really is.

425
00:36:11,574 --> 00:36:13,174
- Hangang Construction 1710 -

426
00:36:28,736 --> 00:36:31,680
I see you're still
holding the fort, Lee Gangmo.

427
00:36:32,659 --> 00:36:35,752
I forgot the Hwang Jeongyeon card.

428
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:39,532
Then... The one who's
been buying our shares...

429
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:42,967
I should have dealt with her first...

430
00:36:43,828 --> 00:36:47,898
Still, it's not like the end
result will be any different.

431
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:51,204
Thanks for setting my factory on fire.

432
00:36:54,172 --> 00:36:56,127
Listen well.

433
00:36:57,191 --> 00:36:59,635
That is what will lead
you to your downfall.

434
00:37:00,832 --> 00:37:04,925
Work hard on that boiler of yours.

435
00:37:13,811 --> 00:37:16,405
You have only three
days left, Lee Gangmo.

436
00:37:17,296 --> 00:37:19,956
In three days, that...

437
00:37:22,687 --> 00:37:25,031
will be worth less than toilet paper.

438
00:37:25,261 --> 00:37:28,728
Hey... Shouldn't we really
thank Jeongyeon for this?

439
00:37:28,978 --> 00:37:33,248
To be honest, if it weren't for
her we would have gone belly up.

440
00:37:46,793 --> 00:37:47,918
What is the matter?

441
00:37:48,024 --> 00:37:49,932
This is serious, Gangmo.

442
00:37:50,718 --> 00:37:51,595
What happened?

443
00:37:51,695 --> 00:37:54,657
It's a top secret from the
Ministry of Finance I just got a hold of,

444
00:37:54,872 --> 00:37:57,187
suggesting that in three
days, the list of ousted companies...

445
00:37:57,259 --> 00:37:59,444
including Hangang Construction will be announced.

446
00:37:59,544 --> 00:38:01,329
In three days?!

447
00:38:01,429 --> 00:38:02,592
That quick?

448
00:38:02,693 --> 00:38:04,561
If you don't do something before then,

449
00:38:04,691 --> 00:38:07,419
it will be over for any
company that is mentioned.

450
00:38:07,538 --> 00:38:09,392
Start the car.

451
00:38:11,203 --> 00:38:15,315
So should there be any
danger of a gas leak or a fire,

452
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:17,828
this mechanism will sound the alarm?

453
00:38:17,929 --> 00:38:23,535
Yes... I tried to explain this to
Sotae a hundred times to no avail,

454
00:38:23,636 --> 00:38:27,072
but I guess having a brain
helped you get it right away?!

455
00:38:27,402 --> 00:38:30,249
Once this boiler is developed, it
will really change the sector's landscape.

456
00:38:30,364 --> 00:38:33,229
Tell me about it.
We should have bought shares earlier...

457
00:38:37,753 --> 00:38:39,095
Jeongyeon.

458
00:38:39,325 --> 00:38:40,709
Gangmo.

459
00:38:40,811 --> 00:38:41,524
You're here?

460
00:38:41,639 --> 00:38:44,888
What's going on, these days
you always come here?!

461
00:38:45,018 --> 00:38:48,195
These two ladies asking questions
nonstop are driving me insane.

462
00:38:48,267 --> 00:38:49,148
Oh... Really?!

463
00:38:49,205 --> 00:38:53,662
I'm the one answering all questions,
so why would that drive you insane?

464
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:55,143
Congrats, Gangmo.

465
00:38:55,286 --> 00:38:58,406
Looks like your boiler
will really be something.

466
00:38:58,622 --> 00:39:01,942
Can you complete development
within the next three days?

467
00:39:02,115 --> 00:39:03,251
Three days?!

468
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:06,146
What's that supposed
to mean, all of a sudden?

469
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:07,270
We must do it.

470
00:39:07,371 --> 00:39:09,570
We're not dealing
with briquette gas here...

471
00:39:09,656 --> 00:39:12,488
I said we must complete it in three days!

472
00:39:15,047 --> 00:39:16,754
Gangmo...

473
00:39:17,232 --> 00:39:20,329
In three days, that's impossible.

474
00:39:21,652 --> 00:39:24,369
Then, how long will it take?

475
00:39:24,481 --> 00:39:28,728
No matter how fast we go,
at least a week... No...

476
00:39:28,837 --> 00:39:30,895
It will take at least ten days.

477
00:39:32,057 --> 00:39:34,242
Gangmo...

478
00:39:39,738 --> 00:39:45,178
The list you gave us
was of great help.

479
00:39:45,302 --> 00:39:48,344
Right... So what did you invest in?

480
00:39:48,475 --> 00:39:52,476
First, 30 billion will be headed
Manbo Construction's way.

481
00:39:52,591 --> 00:39:55,660
I see you're sparing no expense.

482
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:58,701
We carefully analyzed those ailing companies,

483
00:39:58,916 --> 00:40:02,183
and went through a very thorough selection.

484
00:40:02,306 --> 00:40:03,588
Unless that list suddenly changes,

485
00:40:03,675 --> 00:40:05,529
I assure you it will
be worth the investment.

486
00:40:05,601 --> 00:40:10,115
That list is not going to be
altered, so just trust me, President Noh.

487
00:40:10,215 --> 00:40:14,744
Isn't that the reason why
I'm investing my entire fortune?

488
00:40:15,868 --> 00:40:20,582
If you want to look after me,
you'll have to make a lot of money.

489
00:40:20,753 --> 00:40:22,952
I will.

490
00:40:23,499 --> 00:40:29,335
Shouldn't you go for the
highest seat, sooner or later?

491
00:40:29,522 --> 00:40:34,324
Don't you go around mentioning that.

492
00:40:35,244 --> 00:40:39,614
But, when do you plan to sell
those Hangang Construction shares?

493
00:40:39,786 --> 00:40:42,202
We'll start the assault tomorrow.

494
00:40:42,388 --> 00:40:45,652
So it'll be downhill for them starting tomorrow.

495
00:40:45,752 --> 00:40:48,473
Once the list is announced in three days,

496
00:40:48,576 --> 00:40:52,854
it'll be all over for
Hangang Construction's shares.

497
00:40:53,805 --> 00:40:56,536
Here... Let's drink.

498
00:41:04,241 --> 00:41:05,952
It's you?

499
00:41:11,071 --> 00:41:14,518
I have something to tell you.

500
00:41:14,646 --> 00:41:16,419
We know.

501
00:41:16,865 --> 00:41:21,278
So the list will be announced in three days?

502
00:41:22,083 --> 00:41:23,071
Yes.

503
00:41:23,179 --> 00:41:26,877
Will they manage to
complete their boiler on time?

504
00:41:27,002 --> 00:41:30,040
To be honest... It looks unlikely.

505
00:41:30,169 --> 00:41:36,681
Any way to revive the
company's fortunes before then?

506
00:41:36,897 --> 00:41:40,232
Other than telling
you I will give my best...

507
00:41:40,491 --> 00:41:47,935
So shouldn't you start selling all the
Hangang Construction shares you have?

508
00:41:48,108 --> 00:41:50,940
Tell me what you're thinking.

509
00:41:51,155 --> 00:41:53,254
How would you like to proceed?

510
00:41:53,522 --> 00:41:57,538
I still have faith in Gangmo.

511
00:41:59,844 --> 00:42:03,194
Gangmo will succeed.

512
00:42:03,568 --> 00:42:05,508
He's not going to go down this way.

513
00:42:05,609 --> 00:42:07,090
Jeongyeon...

514
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:09,419
I know what you're feeling...

515
00:42:09,562 --> 00:42:13,027
- But the reality of things...
- So?

516
00:42:13,789 --> 00:42:16,425
I'd like to fight with him to the end.

517
00:42:17,444 --> 00:42:20,927
The decision is obviously up to you,

518
00:42:23,146 --> 00:42:25,770
but that's the way I see it.

519
00:42:42,428 --> 00:42:46,558
When it comes to being so
reckless, she just takes after me.

520
00:42:46,757 --> 00:42:50,539
Just pretend you didn't hear that.

521
00:43:14,832 --> 00:43:16,904
I'm in the mood for a drink, too.

522
00:43:17,016 --> 00:43:19,046
Can I join in?

523
00:43:20,315 --> 00:43:22,629
Excuse me, can I have a glass?

524
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:24,297
Yes.

525
00:43:29,588 --> 00:43:31,832
The Hangang Construction shares you have...

526
00:43:33,441 --> 00:43:35,626
must be sold, Jeongyeon.

527
00:43:39,821 --> 00:43:42,504
I don't really think I would endure...

528
00:43:44,862 --> 00:43:47,472
seeing you in difficulty because of this.

529
00:43:51,677 --> 00:43:56,441
Back then, when
I lost Manbo Construction...

530
00:43:56,637 --> 00:43:58,262
Remember?

531
00:43:59,779 --> 00:44:03,935
This is what you told me back then.

532
00:44:06,848 --> 00:44:10,939
"You might abandon it, but
do it with your head held up high."

533
00:44:13,182 --> 00:44:16,988
"Don't show them a single tear."

534
00:44:20,583 --> 00:44:23,078
You can fail once and lose it all, Gangmo.

535
00:44:23,829 --> 00:44:29,101
There are more people who
failed than those who succeeded.

536
00:44:29,401 --> 00:44:33,752
And even more people got back
on their feet after experiencing failure.

537
00:44:34,726 --> 00:44:42,631
Still, even if you do fail,
I don't want to see you lose.

538
00:44:43,065 --> 00:44:50,124
Particularly if whom you're fighting
with are Jo Pilyeon and his son.

539
00:44:51,921 --> 00:44:54,258
Even if you lose the company,

540
00:44:55,633 --> 00:45:00,347
you must remain strong and
fight to the very end.

541
00:45:18,501 --> 00:45:20,850
Thanks, Jeongyeon.

542
00:45:24,926 --> 00:45:27,247
Having you by my side...

543
00:45:29,291 --> 00:45:33,661
gives me great strength.

544
00:45:46,268 --> 00:45:48,770
- Have a drink.
- Sure.

545
00:45:55,356 --> 00:45:59,148
So is it this weekend?

546
00:45:59,265 --> 00:46:00,416
What?

547
00:46:01,602 --> 00:46:03,294
Ahh... That?

548
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:08,170
It still hasn't been signed
by the president, right?

549
00:46:08,335 --> 00:46:10,789
I was going to go to
the Blue House tomorrow.

550
00:46:10,977 --> 00:46:14,877
But why do you
keep bugging me about it?

551
00:46:15,018 --> 00:46:21,691
I was just wondering if you could
delay that announcement a little.

552
00:46:23,542 --> 00:46:25,882
After the torture scandal,

553
00:46:25,999 --> 00:46:29,173
public sentiment is already heated as it is,

554
00:46:29,282 --> 00:46:32,862
so must you really make such
an announcement at a time like this?

555
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:35,329
You do have a point,

556
00:46:35,669 --> 00:46:39,581
but how can I not respect a
deadline made by the president?

557
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:43,340
You could still try to convince him.

558
00:46:43,469 --> 00:46:46,506
What's the reason you're asking me this?

559
00:46:50,189 --> 00:46:56,362
I don't believe this list
was selected in all fairness.

560
00:46:56,803 --> 00:46:59,087
Of course it wasn't.

561
00:46:59,192 --> 00:47:02,751
Since it was born out
of pure bias to begin with.

562
00:47:02,981 --> 00:47:05,007
So let me be perfectly honest.

563
00:47:05,653 --> 00:47:12,108
I'd like you to take Hangang
Construction off that list.

564
00:47:13,058 --> 00:47:14,955
Or if you can't do that,

565
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:17,022
at least delay the announcement,

566
00:47:17,386 --> 00:47:19,759
and give them another chance.

567
00:47:21,016 --> 00:47:25,821
I don't want to test the
president's patience over that.

568
00:47:26,443 --> 00:47:33,245
I've dealt with construction
companies for two decades.

569
00:47:33,619 --> 00:47:37,227
I've occasionally experienced things that
made my heart swell with pride,

570
00:47:37,450 --> 00:47:41,901
but also enough corruption
to grow tired of it.

571
00:47:42,993 --> 00:47:47,586
Of course I couldn't possibly
claim I'm completely clean.

572
00:47:47,668 --> 00:47:48,761
So?

573
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:54,477
President Lee Gangmo is one of the few
competent and honest men I've met in this trade.

574
00:47:54,618 --> 00:47:57,860
So seeing that kind of man be
sacrificed at the altar of corrupt politics...

575
00:47:57,954 --> 00:48:00,244
before he can even spread his wings...

576
00:48:00,702 --> 00:48:04,438
is something that, as someone
who's spent twenty years in this trade,

577
00:48:04,766 --> 00:48:07,492
I couldn't possibly allow to happen.

578
00:48:07,692 --> 00:48:10,229
And should I refuse, what would you do?

579
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:16,044
I think I might be convinced
not to see you again.

580
00:48:16,737 --> 00:48:21,778
How can you so easily tell me that,
considering all we've gone through?

581
00:48:23,723 --> 00:48:29,425
In all our years of friendship,

582
00:48:29,801 --> 00:48:34,123
I have never asked you a single favor.

583
00:48:34,276 --> 00:48:35,521
I know.

584
00:48:36,049 --> 00:48:38,528
And that even disappointed me, at times.

585
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:42,381
This is my very first, and last favor.

586
00:48:43,076 --> 00:48:46,498
Please delay that announcement.

587
00:48:48,507 --> 00:48:52,982
Look what having a
friend like you gets me...

588
00:49:03,992 --> 00:49:06,236
I would have waited even
longer to tell me, if I were you...

589
00:49:06,459 --> 00:49:09,689
You should have come to me first.

590
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:16,635
Anyhow, your help was crucial.

591
00:49:17,610 --> 00:49:20,359
I'll go out a moment and greet him.

592
00:49:20,452 --> 00:49:22,802
Right, go.

593
00:49:36,987 --> 00:49:42,097
Ohh... I was wondering where you went.

594
00:49:45,433 --> 00:49:47,148
Don't worry.

595
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:51,945
I think it will go just as you hoped.

596
00:49:54,941 --> 00:49:57,424
I really envy President Lee?!

597
00:49:57,535 --> 00:50:00,426
He really has a clever little sister.

598
00:50:01,049 --> 00:50:03,878
Thank you, Deputy...

599
00:50:05,969 --> 00:50:09,446
I'll never forget what you did for us.

600
00:50:09,610 --> 00:50:12,453
Thank you so much.

601
00:51:01,961 --> 00:51:05,735
- Current Price 940 won -

602
00:51:38,248 --> 00:51:39,787
- Current Price 940 won -

603
00:52:04,925 --> 00:52:09,165
Why don't you get out of this
while you still can, Director Yoo?

604
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:12,666
You'll soon realize that
there's a glass ceiling above you.

605
00:52:13,065 --> 00:52:17,316
You really think you can
beat my financial resources?

606
00:52:25,684 --> 00:52:28,626
Gather all the capital you can find.

607
00:52:28,756 --> 00:52:30,917
- Director...
- Didn't you hear me?

608
00:52:31,081 --> 00:52:33,103
I said get all the money we have left!

609
00:52:33,208 --> 00:52:35,204
All right.

610
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:42,356
I'm sorry, Director.

611
00:52:42,615 --> 00:52:47,325
We couldn't possibly stop
Noh Gapsoo's assault with that money.

612
00:52:47,548 --> 00:52:54,044
And we pretty much used
all the funds we had.

613
00:53:01,927 --> 00:53:06,990
This is all I have left.

614
00:53:09,113 --> 00:53:10,393
Director...

615
00:53:10,609 --> 00:53:14,187
Use this and resist to the end.

616
00:53:15,327 --> 00:53:16,901
But...

617
00:53:17,077 --> 00:53:19,873
If we use all this money...

618
00:53:20,110 --> 00:53:22,733
I'll let you in on a good news.

619
00:53:22,998 --> 00:53:28,641
The announcement set for
tomorrow has been canceled.

620
00:53:32,001 --> 00:53:35,123
It will be rescheduled to ten days from now.

621
00:53:35,742 --> 00:53:40,832
You must complete that boiler before then.

622
00:53:41,642 --> 00:53:44,009
Thank you, Director.

623
00:53:44,357 --> 00:53:48,656
That money is an investment.

624
00:53:49,161 --> 00:53:51,910
So I will see profits, right?

625
00:53:52,296 --> 00:53:54,788
Yes, Director.

626
00:53:57,783 --> 00:53:59,968
You can go now.

627
00:54:18,641 --> 00:54:23,269
Whatever the case,
aren't you going too far?

628
00:54:25,223 --> 00:54:31,039
It's not like they completed that boiler...

629
00:54:31,674 --> 00:54:38,228
How much do you think
Jeongyeon is worth to me?

630
00:54:40,195 --> 00:54:42,685
Even all the money in the world...

631
00:54:43,402 --> 00:54:46,702
wouldn't mean as much
to me as she does.

632
00:54:48,523 --> 00:54:51,119
I can certainly understand that, but...

633
00:54:52,129 --> 00:54:54,207
The reason Jeongyeon is doing that...

634
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:56,862
is because of Lee Gangmo.

635
00:54:58,917 --> 00:55:01,102
Because she loves him.

636
00:55:02,089 --> 00:55:07,941
Putting everything on the
line for someone you love...

637
00:55:08,869 --> 00:55:13,074
I think that's the noblest
investment anyone could make in life.

638
00:55:15,727 --> 00:55:20,192
Isn't my daughter wonderful?

639
00:55:23,387 --> 00:55:27,663
So that's why I'm investing
everything I have in her.

640
00:55:29,025 --> 00:55:34,715
Because she's my daughter, the person
I most cherish and love in this world.

641
00:55:50,007 --> 00:55:53,017
Aigoo...

642
00:56:01,249 --> 00:56:02,935
It's here!

643
00:56:03,276 --> 00:56:04,497
It's tomorrow's evening paper.

644
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:07,493
Give it her.
Ahh... Come on!

645
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:12,138
You watch.

646
00:56:12,656 --> 00:56:13,856
No, you do it.

647
00:56:13,947 --> 00:56:17,766
I'm so worried I might see that list,
my heart's going to explode.

648
00:56:17,825 --> 00:56:20,926
Just give it here.

649
00:56:30,483 --> 00:56:32,748
Where did my spectacles go?

650
00:56:32,924 --> 00:56:34,510
Ahh... Really, give me a break.

651
00:56:34,592 --> 00:56:36,295
Give it to me.

652
00:56:44,371 --> 00:56:46,521
What's the matter, President?

653
00:56:46,767 --> 00:56:47,860
There's no article about the announcement.

654
00:56:47,942 --> 00:56:49,128
None?

655
00:56:49,269 --> 00:56:50,937
Did you bring yesterday's paper?

656
00:56:51,008 --> 00:56:52,603
Think I'm that stupid?

657
00:56:52,721 --> 00:56:54,306
What's going on here?

658
00:56:54,976 --> 00:56:57,008
Didn't they say it would be today?

659
00:56:58,210 --> 00:57:01,084
The announcement has been postponed.

660
00:57:08,346 --> 00:57:10,237
It's ten days from now.

661
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:13,972
You can complete
the boiler by then, right?

662
00:57:27,866 --> 00:57:30,532
What's wrong with you two?
In public and all...

663
00:57:34,866 --> 00:57:37,093
What are you doing?
There's no time to waste.

664
00:57:37,128 --> 00:57:39,489
Let's finish this!

665
00:57:51,124 --> 00:57:52,992
Oh... Congressman Jo, come on in.

666
00:57:53,101 --> 00:57:55,599
What did you just do?

667
00:57:56,116 --> 00:57:57,184
What did I do?

668
00:57:57,255 --> 00:57:59,910
Why did you postpone that announcement?

669
00:58:00,039 --> 00:58:04,053
The president's attention is
focused on the demonstrations.

670
00:58:04,162 --> 00:58:05,770
Take a look outside.

671
00:58:05,866 --> 00:58:08,628
People are on the verge of
storming towards the Blue House.

672
00:58:08,738 --> 00:58:10,207
So?

673
00:58:10,611 --> 00:58:12,333
So I told the president.

674
00:58:12,498 --> 00:58:15,211
Now wasn't the time to
make that announcement.

675
00:58:15,681 --> 00:58:17,713
Guess he had it with this himself.

676
00:58:17,842 --> 00:58:20,403
He just said "All right, so just go."

677
00:58:22,733 --> 00:58:30,042
But is there any particular reason
why you must make that announcement?

678
00:58:33,765 --> 00:58:35,846
What I was saying...

679
00:58:36,096 --> 00:58:39,187
Congressman Jo seems so
hell-bent on making this announcement...

680
00:58:39,269 --> 00:58:41,947
Look, what are you trying to imply?

681
00:58:42,887 --> 00:58:47,359
I would never allow him to gain
personal benefits out of this,

682
00:58:47,453 --> 00:58:50,032
think Congressman Jo wouldn't be aware of that?

683
00:59:02,142 --> 00:59:03,215
Your turn.

684
00:59:03,303 --> 00:59:04,811
Odds.

685
00:59:13,809 --> 00:59:15,289
Congressman.

686
00:59:16,109 --> 00:59:17,761
Jaechun...

687
00:59:17,961 --> 00:59:21,191
I can't let Oh Byeongtak get away with this.

688
00:59:21,449 --> 00:59:22,741
What?

689
00:59:24,582 --> 00:59:27,710
I want to kill that bastard.

690
00:59:28,837 --> 00:59:31,903
Congressman, calm down...

691
00:59:32,161 --> 00:59:33,806
and take a look at this.

692
00:59:36,055 --> 00:59:37,600
And what is that?

693
00:59:37,820 --> 00:59:41,230
It's the data regarding Lee
Seongmo's underling, Yoo Chanseong.

694
00:59:41,453 --> 00:59:42,644
And?!

695
00:59:42,732 --> 00:59:46,414
Yoo Chanseong's older brother was
a doctor for the Eighth US Army.

696
00:59:46,543 --> 00:59:49,050
So, why the hell
would I care about that?

697
00:59:49,468 --> 00:59:50,995
Don't you remember?

698
00:59:51,171 --> 00:59:55,998
That doctor who died back
when we stole that secret Vietnam file.

699
01:00:05,067 --> 01:00:06,691
Hyung!

700
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:15,224
I said the doctor is dead!

701
01:00:15,769 --> 01:00:17,562
The doctor...

702
01:00:17,798 --> 01:00:19,935
is dead!

703
01:00:22,212 --> 01:00:23,443
That's right.

704
01:00:23,749 --> 01:00:25,510
I remember.

705
01:00:25,792 --> 01:00:30,021
The doctor died back then.

706
01:00:31,276 --> 01:00:33,646
So Yoo Chanseong would be his brother?

707
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:36,005
Yes, there is no doubt.

708
01:00:36,157 --> 01:00:42,160
So he must be thinking his
brother died because of me.

709
01:00:42,582 --> 01:00:45,918
Which is why he's doing all this to avenge him.

710
01:00:46,024 --> 01:00:51,622
Everything that's been
happening was plotted by him.

711
01:00:52,008 --> 01:00:53,478
Really?

712
01:00:56,774 --> 01:01:01,513
Then, before he brings harm to me,

713
01:01:03,201 --> 01:01:05,977
I'll have to get rid of him first.

714
01:01:18,064 --> 01:01:20,930
What is she waiting for?

715
01:01:21,256 --> 01:01:23,749
Kids her age are all like that.

716
01:01:25,664 --> 01:01:30,004
The hell does she takes me for...

717
01:01:30,625 --> 01:01:32,439
Ji Yeonsoo!

718
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:52,948
So...

719
01:01:55,056 --> 01:01:57,335
Are you ready?

720
01:01:59,261 --> 01:02:01,634
So, let's get started.

721
01:02:04,370 --> 01:02:05,539
Chief!

722
01:02:05,632 --> 01:02:06,591
Are you out of your mind?

723
01:02:06,649 --> 01:02:08,487
Ohh... I'm so sorry.

724
01:02:08,557 --> 01:02:10,977
Thought it was taekwondo today...

725
01:02:11,047 --> 01:02:13,855
I'm sorry, Chief...

726
01:02:14,830 --> 01:02:15,899
Are you all right?

727
01:02:15,957 --> 01:02:20,308
What now... That's got to hurt.

728
01:02:20,577 --> 01:02:22,760
Breathe...

729
01:02:27,191 --> 01:02:29,071
Good job, everyone.

730
01:02:29,517 --> 01:02:31,984
So Manbo Construction's
boiler is finally complete.

731
01:02:32,231 --> 01:02:33,275
Would you like to take a look, Chairman?

732
01:02:33,371 --> 01:02:34,263
No.

733
01:02:34,369 --> 01:02:35,544
Not now.

734
01:02:37,094 --> 01:02:39,673
When is the boiler's presentation again?

735
01:02:39,769 --> 01:02:41,264
At 2 pm.

736
01:02:41,839 --> 01:02:43,602
With the announcement being postponed,

737
01:02:43,696 --> 01:02:46,956
we'll inevitably have to face
off against Hangang Construction.

738
01:02:47,191 --> 01:02:48,648
Are you confident?

739
01:02:48,824 --> 01:02:51,543
Of course we are.

740
01:02:51,797 --> 01:02:53,335
Call the press.

741
01:02:53,607 --> 01:02:57,187
Lee Gangmo is still
resisting at the stock exchange,

742
01:02:57,551 --> 01:03:00,034
so we need to bring this to an end.

743
01:03:14,751 --> 01:03:16,477
President.

744
01:03:20,016 --> 01:03:22,679
But, we didn't have time,

745
01:03:22,916 --> 01:03:26,660
so we couldn't do
sufficient performance tests.

746
01:03:26,786 --> 01:03:29,111
We did our best.

747
01:03:30,144 --> 01:03:34,538
Now Hangang Construction's destiny...

748
01:03:34,937 --> 01:03:37,275
depends on this boiler.

749
01:03:41,518 --> 01:03:43,409
You haven't heard anything
about Manbo Construction?

750
01:03:43,503 --> 01:03:46,463
They keep a tight lid on development, so...

751
01:03:47,050 --> 01:03:48,613
Let's go for it.

752
01:03:49,707 --> 01:03:54,508
We're at the edge of the cliff.

757
01:04:12,536 --> 01:04:16,826
This could severely
impact Manbo Construction and Noh Gapsoo.

758
01:04:16,951 --> 01:04:19,587
It could even destroy them for good.

759
01:04:19,658 --> 01:04:23,332
Where did Hangang Construction
and the rest of those ten companies go?

760
01:04:23,427 --> 01:04:24,990
Watch what you say, Jo Pilyeon!!

761
01:04:25,131 --> 01:04:27,778
That account... give it to me.

762
01:04:27,870 --> 01:04:30,335
Congressman Oh says
he's got something for us.

763
01:04:30,445 --> 01:04:33,356
Seems like it's a secret
report about Jo Pilyeon.

764
01:04:33,426 --> 01:04:35,399
This is all because of Oh Byeongtak.

765
01:04:35,517 --> 01:04:36,996
How do you plan to deal with this?

766
01:04:37,106 --> 01:04:38,712
We must get rid of him.

767
01:04:38,818 --> 01:04:41,284
Go for Hwang Taeseop.

768
01:04:41,367 --> 01:04:44,479
I'm sure Lee Gangmo's name will surface.
