<i>Gold bars, you said?</i>

6
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:14,873
<i>You saw me kill him,
so I can't allow you to survive.</i>

7
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:18,181
<i>Whatever I'll end up doing,
I will always be loyal to you.</i>

8
00:00:18,338 --> 00:00:21,458
<i>At the end of this month, let's meet
on top of Seoul's tallest building.</i>

9
00:00:21,547 --> 00:00:24,559
<i>Where is my mother?
I mean my birth mother.</i>

10
00:00:24,668 --> 00:00:26,431
<i>So you're looking for your mother?</i>

11
00:00:26,577 --> 00:00:31,148
<i>I'll always be looking at you,
so take good care of your siblings,</i>

12
00:00:31,245 --> 00:00:32,905
<i>and whatever happens,
you must never cry.</i>

13
00:00:32,986 --> 00:00:37,521
<i>He will be in possession of a top secret
document regarding the Vietnam war.</i>

14
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:39,395
<i>Bring us that document.</i>

15
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:41,641
<i>Did he see your face?</i>

16
00:00:41,735 --> 00:00:44,656
<i>If he regains his consciousness,
it's all over for us.</i>

17
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:46,259
<i>Got it?</i>

18
00:00:46,385 --> 00:00:51,611
<i>Big Oppa, hurry up and come.
I miss you, Big Oppa!</i>

~ Episode 4 ~

20
00:01:24,853 --> 00:01:27,021
Gangmo...

21
00:01:27,586 --> 00:01:29,815
Miju...

22
00:01:32,018 --> 00:01:34,015
Gangmo...

23
00:01:34,436 --> 00:01:36,701
Miju...

24
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:40,306
Gangmo...

25
00:01:41,971 --> 00:01:44,088
Miju...

26
00:01:54,607 --> 00:01:56,255
It's really cold.

27
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:58,850
How about we go somewhere
and warm ourselves up a little?

28
00:01:59,078 --> 00:02:01,830
No way, what if Big Oppa comes?

29
00:02:01,974 --> 00:02:04,059
We haven't eaten a thing all day long.

30
00:02:04,203 --> 00:02:05,429
Let's at least have something to eat.

31
00:02:05,573 --> 00:02:07,340
When Big Oppa comes, we'll eat together.

32
00:02:07,448 --> 00:02:09,875
You silly! Hyung...

33
00:02:12,621 --> 00:02:15,023
<i>Hyung might not come at all.</i>

34
00:02:15,187 --> 00:02:19,026
<i>After falling off that moving train,
he might have even died.</i>

35
00:02:22,043 --> 00:02:26,369
It's getting dark,
why isn't Big Oppa coming?

36
00:02:31,866 --> 00:02:33,801
Miju, you really are silly.

37
00:02:33,933 --> 00:02:35,892
You're telling me you really
don't know why he's so late?

38
00:02:36,036 --> 00:02:37,923
Why is he late?

39
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:39,906
Think of how much he'll be missing you.

40
00:02:40,038 --> 00:02:41,649
But would he come empty-handed?

41
00:02:41,781 --> 00:02:45,056
If he needs to buy your favorite
dolls, candies and all those gifts,

42
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,075
it's only natural he'd be late.

43
00:02:47,231 --> 00:02:48,157
Really?

44
00:02:48,265 --> 00:02:49,947
Of course.

45
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:53,444
What gift will you have for him?

46
00:02:54,249 --> 00:02:58,206
Now that I think about it, 
I don't have anything to give him?!

47
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:00,783
I'm sure he'll be disappointed...

48
00:03:01,071 --> 00:03:04,227
Then, what can I do?
I don't have any money.

49
00:03:04,412 --> 00:03:06,178
Hyung likes your songs.

50
00:03:06,323 --> 00:03:08,519
Then, should I sing him
a song when he comes?

51
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:11,352
Yeah. A really exciting one at that.

52
00:03:11,641 --> 00:03:16,748
There... Imagine Hyung is coming,
his hands filled with gifts.

53
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:19,548
What are you waiting for?

54
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,372
Aren't you giving Hyung his present?

55
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:28,383
Big Oppa, wait there a moment!

56
00:03:28,612 --> 00:03:32,025
"Just a look and my heart throbs."

57
00:03:32,181 --> 00:03:36,160
"Just a thought and my heart throbs."

58
00:03:36,293 --> 00:03:44,212
"Ignore the blooming first love
of an innocent nineteen-year-old."

59
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:47,757
<i>"So that nobody in the world will know,"</i>

60
00:03:47,889 --> 00:03:52,147
<i>"And he will remain hidden
at the bottom of my heart."</i>

61
00:03:53,036 --> 00:03:58,000
<i>"Hidden in my heart."</i>

62
00:03:58,192 --> 00:04:01,893
"As red as a bed of roses,"

63
00:04:02,062 --> 00:04:06,664
"The beating heart of an
innocent nineteen-year-old."

64
00:04:21,706 --> 00:04:24,554
Miju, I have a nice idea.

65
00:04:24,711 --> 00:04:26,081
What?

66
00:04:26,693 --> 00:04:31,516
Let's hide somewhere, 
so we can surprise Hyung when he comes.

67
00:04:31,612 --> 00:04:33,058
He will never expect that.

68
00:04:33,295 --> 00:04:34,641
That's got to be fun.

69
00:04:34,809 --> 00:04:37,933
Before Hyung comes, let's go hide.

70
00:04:42,837 --> 00:04:44,697
Hurry up, Oppa.

71
00:04:44,829 --> 00:04:46,439
All right.

72
00:04:55,645 --> 00:04:57,037
Looks tasty.

73
00:04:57,206 --> 00:04:58,833
Go ahead and eat.

74
00:05:02,181 --> 00:05:05,149
We're playing hide-and-seek now.

75
00:05:05,293 --> 00:05:10,986
Until Hyung screams "I can't find you, I lost!"
we must hide here.

76
00:05:11,155 --> 00:05:13,702
- Got it?
- Yeah.

77
00:05:16,406 --> 00:05:21,177
I'll go out and wait for Hyung,
so take good care of the baby.

78
00:05:32,779 --> 00:05:34,642
Oppa.

79
00:05:35,772 --> 00:05:39,599
Don't even think of
telling him I'm hiding here.

80
00:05:40,296 --> 00:05:42,171
All right.

81
00:06:09,159 --> 00:06:11,563
Are you sure he saw Jaechun's face?

82
00:06:11,719 --> 00:06:12,615
Yes.

83
00:06:12,712 --> 00:06:14,115
Go find out.

84
00:06:14,206 --> 00:06:14,891
What?

85
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,464
Find out when he'll
regain his consciousness!

86
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,596
Yes!

87
00:06:18,744 --> 00:06:22,021
No... Wait!
It's all useless.

88
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:25,494
There's no solution!
None!

89
00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:48,448
I'm sure this room is bugged.

90
00:06:48,561 --> 00:06:50,519
- Otherwise...
- When the kid wakes up,

91
00:06:50,651 --> 00:06:52,946
he'll identify the criminal.

92
00:06:53,691 --> 00:06:55,581
The kid's gone!

93
00:06:56,167 --> 00:06:57,377
What?

94
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:00,664
I checked the ward,
but he wasn't there.

95
00:07:36,653 --> 00:07:38,126
Hyung...

96
00:07:38,432 --> 00:07:41,062
You're not really dead, right?

97
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:56,294
<i>Hey.</i>

98
00:07:56,475 --> 00:07:59,395
How much longer are
you going to stay here?

99
00:08:01,991 --> 00:08:03,838
Ohh?! It's Big Oppa!

100
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:05,565
Oppa!

101
00:08:06,109 --> 00:08:08,224
Ajumma, I'll be back right away.

102
00:08:08,369 --> 00:08:12,178
Hey...
Where are you going?

103
00:08:13,704 --> 00:08:15,114
Oppa!

104
00:08:15,303 --> 00:08:18,508
Big Oppa!
Oppa!

105
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:24,820
Oppa!

106
00:08:24,911 --> 00:08:28,470
- Eonni, wait a moment!
- Hurry up.

107
00:08:30,693 --> 00:08:32,412
All right!

108
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:38,601
Big Oppa...

109
00:08:40,379 --> 00:08:42,220
Oppa.

110
00:08:46,247 --> 00:08:48,026
Oppa!

111
00:09:01,191 --> 00:09:02,731
Oppa...

112
00:09:02,897 --> 00:09:05,252
Little Oppa...

113
00:09:25,571 --> 00:09:26,713
Where is my sister?

114
00:09:26,845 --> 00:09:31,267
Why ask me?
She left the baby to me and ran out.

115
00:09:34,152 --> 00:09:37,677
Hey! Bring the baby along!

116
00:09:37,858 --> 00:09:39,624
Miju!

117
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,491
Lee Miju!

118
00:09:48,517 --> 00:09:50,223
Miju!

119
00:09:51,076 --> 00:09:53,497
Lee Miju!

120
00:09:54,338 --> 00:09:56,189
Miju.

121
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,905
Lee Miju!

122
00:10:00,924 --> 00:10:02,666
Miju!

123
00:10:03,037 --> 00:10:06,846
Miju!
Lee Miju!

124
00:10:07,099 --> 00:10:09,214
Miju!

125
00:10:10,368 --> 00:10:12,513
Miju!

126
00:10:13,504 --> 00:10:15,091
Miju!

127
00:10:15,403 --> 00:10:17,502
Miju!

128
00:10:19,314 --> 00:10:21,308
Miju!

129
00:10:22,203 --> 00:10:24,131
Where are you?

130
00:10:24,907 --> 00:10:26,764
Lee Miju!

131
00:10:27,329 --> 00:10:29,348
Miju!

132
00:10:31,508 --> 00:10:33,467
You silly...

133
00:10:34,585 --> 00:10:37,469
Hide-and-seek is over!

134
00:10:38,034 --> 00:10:40,245
Come out now!

135
00:10:47,596 --> 00:10:50,540
I can't find you, I lost!

136
00:10:52,475 --> 00:10:55,444
I can't find you, I lost!

137
00:10:57,138 --> 00:11:00,285
Miju, come out...

138
00:11:02,749 --> 00:11:06,042
I can't find you, I lost!

139
00:11:08,248 --> 00:11:11,464
I can't find you, I lost...

140
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:15,003
Miju!

141
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:18,051
Come out...

142
00:11:20,238 --> 00:11:23,314
Miju, come out...

143
00:11:24,312 --> 00:11:27,237
I can't find you, I lost...

144
00:11:28,738 --> 00:11:30,914
<i>Miju!</i>

145
00:11:34,914 --> 00:11:36,827
<i>Miju...</i>

146
00:11:41,692 --> 00:11:44,083
Mom!

147
00:11:49,239 --> 00:11:51,150
Mother!

148
00:11:51,724 --> 00:11:56,467
Gangmo.
Miju.

149
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:00,559
Mom!

150
00:12:09,345 --> 00:12:11,165
It's okay.

151
00:12:20,654 --> 00:12:23,044
I hear your witness has disappeared.

152
00:12:23,224 --> 00:12:25,760
What do you plan to do now?

153
00:12:27,142 --> 00:12:29,425
Listen carefully, General Hampton.

154
00:12:29,617 --> 00:12:35,073
You must never forget that you 
didn't only damage my reputation,

155
00:12:35,918 --> 00:12:38,754
but also that of this country.

156
00:12:40,989 --> 00:12:42,804
Follow me.

157
00:12:59,437 --> 00:13:00,810
Yeah...

158
00:13:00,975 --> 00:13:03,722
Her name is Lee Miju.

159
00:13:04,034 --> 00:13:07,362
He said he lost sight of her
around here, so search around.

160
00:13:07,567 --> 00:13:09,156
<i>Right.</i>

161
00:13:09,334 --> 00:13:11,887
<i>I have no idea, either.</i>

162
00:13:12,278 --> 00:13:13,461
<i>Yeah...</i>

163
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,165
<i>All right.</i>

164
00:13:36,993 --> 00:13:39,144
<i>Did you meet today for 
the first time, or something?</i>

165
00:13:39,264 --> 00:13:40,819
<i>Let's see some smiles, shall we?</i>

166
00:13:40,927 --> 00:13:44,785
Hyung. Give me that hat.

167
00:13:47,044 --> 00:13:49,357
<i>Here... I'm shooting.</i>

168
00:13:49,892 --> 00:13:53,450
<i>1... 2... 3!</i>

169
00:14:03,754 --> 00:14:10,762
<i>Where on earth have you gone?</i>

170
00:14:15,676 --> 00:14:18,067
<i>Where?</i>

171
00:14:46,831 --> 00:14:50,856
Honey! Honey, come out here!

172
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,822
Aigoo, what are you screaming for?

173
00:14:57,045 --> 00:14:59,400
What are you doing here?

174
00:14:59,629 --> 00:15:01,762
<i>You couldn't meet your brother?</i>

175
00:15:02,989 --> 00:15:08,012
Did my sister Miju come here?

176
00:15:08,193 --> 00:15:09,815
She hasn't.

177
00:15:09,983 --> 00:15:12,071
Why, have you lost your sister?

178
00:15:17,643 --> 00:15:20,287
Forget your sister,
and go to the health center.

179
00:15:20,431 --> 00:15:22,474
- Why?
- This baby is burning!

180
00:15:22,582 --> 00:15:23,990
Uh? What?

181
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:26,753
Aigoo... This is trouble.

182
00:15:26,827 --> 00:15:28,156
Untie this load.

183
00:15:28,249 --> 00:15:29,642
Untie it.

184
00:15:29,715 --> 00:15:30,978
Come on.

185
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:41,287
She's too young to
search for her around here,

186
00:15:41,419 --> 00:15:44,517
so it would be better to
look around where you lost her.

187
00:15:47,564 --> 00:15:49,643
The baby is suffering
from severe malnutrition.

188
00:15:49,811 --> 00:15:53,024
Unless you do something, 
the situation might become even more serious.

189
00:15:53,344 --> 00:15:55,471
Leave the baby to our care.

190
00:15:55,615 --> 00:15:58,608
I really think that's the only way.

191
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,462
I'll never accept foreign adoption.

192
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:04,024
I'll raise that baby myself.

193
00:16:04,158 --> 00:16:06,190
The baby could die if you keep this up.

194
00:16:06,406 --> 00:16:09,968
No matter how young you are,
you must be aware of the situation.

195
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:12,991
<i>I'll come back in the evening.</i>

196
00:16:13,177 --> 00:16:15,352
<i>Make up your mind by then.</i>

197
00:16:57,036 --> 00:17:00,907
I'm sure they moved that
secret document elsewhere.

198
00:17:01,051 --> 00:17:02,529
Unless they discovered our bug,

199
00:17:02,674 --> 00:17:04,613
we will find out,
no matter where they put it.

200
00:17:04,721 --> 00:17:07,497
But it won't be easy to 
make them stop suspecting us.

201
00:17:07,678 --> 00:17:10,405
You can never repeat
the same mistake twice.

202
00:17:10,646 --> 00:17:12,322
I will bear it in mind.

203
00:17:13,614 --> 00:17:14,578
This is serious.

204
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:15,527
What, again?

205
00:17:15,648 --> 00:17:18,814
That eye-witness who vanished
has just returned to the base.

206
00:17:18,976 --> 00:17:20,321
What?

207
00:17:36,845 --> 00:17:39,344
Yes, Jo Pilyeon speaking.

208
00:17:43,776 --> 00:17:44,629
All right.

209
00:17:44,737 --> 00:17:47,056
I will head there soon.

210
00:17:53,413 --> 00:17:56,284
I'll take all the blame for this.

211
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:01,349
I am the only one responsible for this.

212
00:18:01,524 --> 00:18:04,120
Even if I have to stake my life for it,

213
00:18:05,225 --> 00:18:08,482
I will make sure you
face no repercussions.

214
00:18:11,486 --> 00:18:13,240
Jaechun.

215
00:18:14,154 --> 00:18:18,893
Remain here until the end,
and complete your task.

216
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:33,050
<i>~ We are being bugged ~</i>

217
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:41,762
Can you recognize the
suspect, if you see him?

218
00:19:03,013 --> 00:19:04,677
Is he the one?

219
00:19:05,092 --> 00:19:06,895
Yes.

220
00:19:12,495 --> 00:19:17,685
With God as your witness, 
you must speak nothing but the truth.

221
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:19,672
Is that clear?

222
00:19:24,528 --> 00:19:28,044
If my aide does indeed
turn out to be the culprit,

223
00:19:28,176 --> 00:19:30,688
I won't be able to forgive him myself.

224
00:19:30,901 --> 00:19:35,375
If he brought dishonor both to me
and to this country's armed forces,

225
00:19:35,687 --> 00:19:39,124
allow me to punish him firsthand.

226
00:19:47,722 --> 00:19:49,236
Speak.

227
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:54,782
Is this the man you
witnessed on the scene?

228
00:20:08,001 --> 00:20:09,905
Go ahead and say it.

229
00:20:10,891 --> 00:20:17,068
Is my aide the man you saw here?

230
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,826
No.

231
00:20:31,285 --> 00:20:33,472
Look carefully.

232
00:20:35,349 --> 00:20:37,428
The man I saw...

233
00:20:38,486 --> 00:20:40,637
is not him.

234
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,279
Have you heard?

235
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:58,086
I trust you'll stop
with the insinuations now.

236
00:21:25,938 --> 00:21:27,440
What is going on?

237
00:21:27,632 --> 00:21:29,479
You said he saw you.

238
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,267
I can't explain it myself.

239
00:21:33,241 --> 00:21:34,707
There's a possibility he
might have not recognized you.

240
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:36,112
Or he probably hasn't seen you at all.

241
00:21:36,257 --> 00:21:38,688
He has no reason to lie.

242
00:21:39,694 --> 00:21:41,176
Are you positive?

243
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,177
Isn't he the guy?

244
00:21:47,082 --> 00:21:49,353
<i>~ We are being bugged ~</i>

245
00:21:56,842 --> 00:22:00,040
We... We couldn't find anything here.

246
00:22:01,305 --> 00:22:03,240
<i>You know how to make those boots shine?</i>

247
00:22:03,396 --> 00:22:06,232
I don't want to see
a blemish on them, got it?

248
00:22:08,576 --> 00:22:09,865
What is it?

249
00:22:10,138 --> 00:22:12,241
I brought the General's boots.

250
00:22:12,658 --> 00:22:14,488
<i>Leave them over there.</i>

251
00:22:50,399 --> 00:22:52,514
I'm sure that was the man I saw.

252
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:56,245
But if I had revealed it now,
that aide would have taken all the blame.

253
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:57,910
You're right.

254
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:01,059
We won't be able to
arrest Jo right about now.

255
00:23:01,744 --> 00:23:04,698
- He might be working with the CIA.
- Nah.

256
00:23:05,514 --> 00:23:07,389
Someone in the ROK
government is behind this.

257
00:23:07,557 --> 00:23:10,862
Why would the ROK government
try to get classified intel...

258
00:23:11,018 --> 00:23:12,172
about the Vietnam war?

259
00:23:12,304 --> 00:23:16,060
They're about to have a presidential
election pretty soon, it's plausible.

260
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,752
Remember, the relationship between
the ROK and American government...

261
00:23:18,908 --> 00:23:21,432
isn't exactly peachy keen 
right about now.

262
00:23:21,576 --> 00:23:23,595
Yeah... Could be true.

263
00:23:23,763 --> 00:23:24,989
<i>He's right.</i>

264
00:23:25,169 --> 00:23:28,197
We need to get Jo,
in order to end this.

265
00:23:28,366 --> 00:23:29,875
Got any ideas?

266
00:23:30,516 --> 00:23:35,287
We will use the trap that
they've set up against them.

267
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:39,405
You mean using a bug against them?

268
00:23:47,024 --> 00:23:50,797
Will you help us out?

269
00:23:51,362 --> 00:23:54,607
We need a spy.
Jo Pilyeon is going to approach you.

270
00:23:54,763 --> 00:23:58,670
We need to make him trust you.
Got it?

271
00:24:06,589 --> 00:24:12,238
Your name is Junmo.

272
00:24:13,247 --> 00:24:14,894
Lee Junmo.

273
00:24:18,102 --> 00:24:20,818
Your brother gave it to you.

274
00:24:26,947 --> 00:24:29,146
I'm really sorry.

275
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:37,881
When you grow up,

276
00:24:38,434 --> 00:24:44,827
your brother will
make a lot of money,

277
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:52,115
and will find you once again.

278
00:24:53,449 --> 00:24:57,896
I'll find Hyung and Miju as well,

279
00:24:58,202 --> 00:25:01,657
and the four of us...

280
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:04,392
will all live together.

281
00:25:06,735 --> 00:25:08,634
I will never,

282
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:15,773
ever let poverty force me 
to abandon my family again.

283
00:25:17,653 --> 00:25:19,984
I promise.

284
00:25:25,188 --> 00:25:29,185
If we end up meeting again,

285
00:25:31,084 --> 00:25:37,681
let's spend the rest
of our days together.

286
00:25:42,472 --> 00:25:44,972
I'm sorry, baby...

287
00:25:50,524 --> 00:25:52,735
I'm sorry.

288
00:25:59,614 --> 00:26:01,934
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

289
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,984
<i>Parents

291
00:26:56,454 --> 00:26:58,726

00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:05,816
Don't... Junmo...
Junmo...

293
00:27:11,656 --> 00:27:13,483
Junmo...

294
00:27:15,514 --> 00:27:17,530
Junmo.

295
00:27:17,938 --> 00:27:24,284
One day I will find you again.

296
00:27:25,966 --> 00:27:28,487
So...

297
00:27:31,131 --> 00:27:33,402
You must be in good health.

298
00:27:35,818 --> 00:27:37,880
Baby...

299
00:27:41,773 --> 00:27:44,597
Junmo!

300
00:28:02,634 --> 00:28:04,142
Seonsaengnim, you've come.

301
00:28:04,388 --> 00:28:05,518
You twat!

302
00:28:05,722 --> 00:28:07,645
What the hell is wrong with you?

303
00:28:07,801 --> 00:28:12,143
Is that all you could fill,
ever since the construction started?

304
00:28:12,287 --> 00:28:13,898
We lack sand.

305
00:28:13,994 --> 00:28:15,075
Hey... Hey!

306
00:28:15,207 --> 00:28:17,695
It's all sand and gravel by the Han River,

307
00:28:17,827 --> 00:28:19,281
but "we lack sand"?!

308
00:28:19,402 --> 00:28:21,961
Our competitors have been digging
it all up down to the last grain,

309
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:23,445
so there's nothing left for us.

310
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:25,921
Make some sense, will you?

311
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:27,351
If there's none left, buy it!

312
00:28:27,495 --> 00:28:29,645
What did you do with
all the money I gave you?

313
00:28:29,768 --> 00:28:32,759
The entire country is suffering
from a lack of raw materials.

314
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:35,258
Particularly so when it
comes to construction sand.

315
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:38,979
Then, head to Mount Bukhan
and dig whatever you need!

316
00:28:39,148 --> 00:28:42,903
If we don't fill this lot, 
it's over for us!

317
00:28:43,089 --> 00:28:44,784
<i>Director Hwang.</i>

318
00:28:47,968 --> 00:28:48,954
Go.

319
00:28:49,134 --> 00:28:50,556
Major Jo Pilyeon is here.

320
00:28:50,724 --> 00:28:52,010
What?

321
00:28:53,464 --> 00:28:57,574
And what is that fella doing here, again?

322
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:07,571
What brings you here?

323
00:29:07,751 --> 00:29:11,453
I was curious about what happened
to that land I told you to buy.

324
00:29:11,633 --> 00:29:13,189
I couldn't buy it.

325
00:29:13,652 --> 00:29:15,166
You couldn't?!

326
00:29:15,298 --> 00:29:17,503
I'm sure it wasn't for lack of money?!

327
00:29:17,767 --> 00:29:19,630
I have no money.

328
00:29:20,243 --> 00:29:24,341
I shared those gold bars with you.

329
00:29:24,593 --> 00:29:29,393
Not to mention giving you the kind of 
precious estate leads only the elite know.

330
00:29:29,677 --> 00:29:32,123
But you didn't have 
enough money to buy it?

331
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:35,713
I'm just in the construction business,

332
00:29:35,869 --> 00:29:38,317
not a real estate speculator.

333
00:29:39,667 --> 00:29:40,640
Say what?

334
00:29:40,772 --> 00:29:42,947
If we manage to reclaim
that public water surface,

335
00:29:43,116 --> 00:29:48,270
the Seoul City council
will authorize construction.

336
00:29:48,665 --> 00:29:52,823
It's the chance of a lifetime
Manbo Construction had been waiting...

337
00:29:52,968 --> 00:29:54,870
Listen to me, Director Hwang!

338
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:57,964
<i>Dig the land or stop the river, 
I couldn't care less.</i>

339
00:29:58,085 --> 00:30:01,438
All you need is to make the
most money in the shortest time.

340
00:30:01,654 --> 00:30:04,918
"Real estate speculator"?!

341
00:30:05,391 --> 00:30:06,533
Are you tired of making money already,

342
00:30:06,641 --> 00:30:12,353
or did you bury your guts 
under that landfill?

343
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:19,207
If I complete this land reclamation, 
I can make enough money.

344
00:30:19,996 --> 00:30:23,847
Halt the construction immediately,
and buy more land with that money.

345
00:30:23,991 --> 00:30:29,003
I will first complete the construction,
and only then buy more land.

346
00:30:35,228 --> 00:30:37,809
Let me make myself clear.

347
00:30:38,374 --> 00:30:42,699
If you lose my favor,
you'll only end up in misery.

348
00:30:42,892 --> 00:30:46,476
I'm facing enough misery as it is.

349
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:50,560
So, please, stop 
interfering in my business.

350
00:30:50,753 --> 00:30:53,348
You really...

351
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:17,406
Having to repeat myself...

352
00:31:17,623 --> 00:31:19,546
is something I really hate.

353
00:31:20,026 --> 00:31:21,652
Before my next visit,

354
00:31:21,901 --> 00:31:26,516
I want you to buy all that land.

355
00:31:42,364 --> 00:31:45,423
Insolent little bastard...

356
00:31:50,639 --> 00:31:52,465
How did it go?

357
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,817
We can't keep this document here anymore.

358
00:32:04,117 --> 00:32:06,283
I'm going back stateside this weekend.

359
00:32:06,436 --> 00:32:07,794
I can take it with me.

360
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:11,689
You know the importance of
this document, take care of it.

361
00:32:11,917 --> 00:32:13,948
Yes, Sir.

362
00:32:23,762 --> 00:32:28,136
Now everything depends on you.

363
00:32:35,683 --> 00:32:38,388
I will get my hands on that document.

364
00:32:39,324 --> 00:32:40,970
It's a piece of cake.

365
00:32:41,127 --> 00:32:43,374
If this isn't luck knocking at
our door, what else could be?

366
00:32:43,524 --> 00:32:46,859
But if this intel is fake?

367
00:32:47,019 --> 00:32:48,505
What?

368
00:32:49,899 --> 00:32:53,992
I'm sure they know they're being bugged.

369
00:32:54,172 --> 00:32:56,059
If it's Hampton we're dealing with,

370
00:32:56,167 --> 00:33:00,397
he could easily fabricate
false intel to lure us into a trap.

371
00:33:02,873 --> 00:33:08,882
But if it's not, we'll forever lose
our chance to get that document.

372
00:33:10,181 --> 00:33:13,352
We can't sit and stare while it happens.

373
00:33:15,323 --> 00:33:18,978
Verifying this intel's authenticity
is our most urgent priority,

374
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:24,170
but I can't figure out
what they're scheming.

375
00:34:26,779 --> 00:34:29,687
- Have a nice day!
- Come again.

376
00:34:29,792 --> 00:34:32,751
<i>Hyungnim, take these.</i>

377
00:35:25,656 --> 00:35:28,432
Out of the way.

378
00:35:38,007 --> 00:35:38,870
You're back?

379
00:35:38,945 --> 00:35:40,129
No calls for me?

380
00:35:40,223 --> 00:35:43,425
Your wife called, 
saying she'll come by this evening.

381
00:35:45,462 --> 00:35:46,952
How about the sand?

382
00:35:47,096 --> 00:35:49,290
We did give it a try,
but it didn't go as we expected.

383
00:35:49,422 --> 00:35:53,293
I'd advise to use whatever we secured
and start the construction right away.

384
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:56,489
And what are you 
going to fill with that?

385
00:35:56,681 --> 00:35:59,121
I'll be damned, really...

386
00:35:59,577 --> 00:36:00,635
<i>Miss Kim.</i>

387
00:36:00,803 --> 00:36:02,341
Hand me the brush.

388
00:36:02,517 --> 00:36:06,163
Every time I go to the construction site, 
my shoes become a mess.

389
00:36:08,927 --> 00:36:10,316
<i>And you are?</i>

390
00:36:10,533 --> 00:36:14,456
Was just wondering if
anyone needed his shoes shined.

391
00:36:14,543 --> 00:36:16,386
Nobody, go.

392
00:36:19,799 --> 00:36:21,255
Kiddo.

393
00:36:25,638 --> 00:36:26,636
Hey.

394
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,789
What are you doing?

395
00:36:27,934 --> 00:36:31,271
I'm just brushing them
a little to remove the dirt.

396
00:36:31,863 --> 00:36:33,678
What, for free?

397
00:36:33,846 --> 00:36:35,468
Yes. Take a look.

398
00:36:35,625 --> 00:36:38,330
I only brushed them,
and they're clean already.

399
00:36:39,487 --> 00:36:41,263
Little runt...

400
00:36:41,731 --> 00:36:45,240
If you ever need your shoes shined, 
you must let me do it.

401
00:36:45,396 --> 00:36:46,851
Have a nice day.

402
00:36:46,959 --> 00:36:48,522
Come here.

403
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,614
- Here... Shine mine.
- Uh?

404
00:36:51,686 --> 00:36:54,442
Yes.

405
00:36:54,574 --> 00:36:56,305
Thank you.

406
00:36:58,096 --> 00:36:59,874
Why don't you 
have yours shined as well?

407
00:36:59,982 --> 00:37:00,884
Forget it.

408
00:37:00,992 --> 00:37:02,934
Why should I bother?
They'll get dirty again in no time.

409
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:05,398
You said you're going out for
dinner with your family later.

410
00:37:05,494 --> 00:37:06,837
Are you going there in that state?

411
00:37:06,934 --> 00:37:08,570
Ohh... Do mine, too.

412
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:10,049
Yes.

413
00:37:14,711 --> 00:37:17,256
Hey.
Take these as well.

414
00:37:17,365 --> 00:37:19,038
Yes, Director.

415
00:37:23,632 --> 00:37:25,916
Ahh... So embarrassing...

416
00:37:26,027 --> 00:37:27,837
That damned brat...

417
00:37:27,925 --> 00:37:29,597
I'll make them shine in a moment.

418
00:37:29,675 --> 00:37:31,458
All right.

419
00:37:32,498 --> 00:37:33,813
<i>The hell is this...</i>

420
00:37:33,933 --> 00:37:35,774
Have a nice day.

421
00:37:43,799 --> 00:37:45,602
Who gave you permission
to shine shoes here?

422
00:37:45,794 --> 00:37:48,618
Why? Is it forbidden
to shine shoes here?

423
00:37:48,751 --> 00:37:51,063
He's got more guts than brains.

424
00:37:51,226 --> 00:37:53,786
<i>{\a6}*Japanese for turf/territory; gained 
popularity as post-colonial Korean slang</i>

425
00:37:51,226 --> 00:37:53,786
This is my nawabari*.

426
00:37:54,603 --> 00:37:56,740
Na...Nawabari?!

427
00:37:57,016 --> 00:37:58,819
What's that?

428
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,670
You fool.

429
00:38:00,982 --> 00:38:04,371
<i>We're paying protection
money to work here.</i>

430
00:38:04,551 --> 00:38:08,264
How dare you try to
steal food from our table?

431
00:38:09,178 --> 00:38:10,889
I need to make money.

432
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:13,237
So stop barging in.

433
00:38:14,391 --> 00:38:16,674
<i>Did you stuff your ears 
with shoe polish?</i>

434
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:18,032
Hey!

435
00:38:24,064 --> 00:38:26,948
Stop... It's my polish box!
Don't!

436
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,600
<i>Let go...</i>

437
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,837
Give it back!

438
00:38:35,282 --> 00:38:37,336
<i>Kick him!</i>

439
00:38:39,644 --> 00:38:41,387
Give it back to me!

440
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,452
<i>My box!</i>

441
00:38:50,384 --> 00:38:51,381
No...

442
00:38:51,526 --> 00:38:53,316
My polish box!

443
00:38:53,912 --> 00:38:57,354
You idiot... Should have listened
while you still could.

444
00:38:58,616 --> 00:39:00,298
<i>Stay put, will you?</i>

445
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:08,311
Prance around my turf again,

446
00:39:08,486 --> 00:39:11,238
and I'll throw you into the fire 
instead of your polish box.

447
00:39:11,394 --> 00:39:12,584
Got it?

448
00:39:13,497 --> 00:39:14,945
Let's go.

449
00:39:37,115 --> 00:39:40,263
Do you know how hard
convincing her to come was?

450
00:39:40,431 --> 00:39:42,731
It's not like I was forcing
her to the slaughterhouse...

451
00:39:42,859 --> 00:39:47,238
All I asked her was to go out for dinner
with us, and she makes such a scene?

452
00:39:47,779 --> 00:39:49,461
Why force someone to
do something against their will?

453
00:39:49,593 --> 00:39:52,395
You said to bring her along.

454
00:39:52,586 --> 00:39:54,580
I'll just go back.

455
00:39:54,761 --> 00:39:55,794
I can, right?

456
00:39:55,938 --> 00:39:57,590
First have dinner with us.

457
00:39:57,722 --> 00:40:02,481
You can go out without me
and have a nice dinner together.

458
00:40:13,055 --> 00:40:15,302
Hey... 
What did you do with these shoes?

459
00:40:15,445 --> 00:40:17,253
<i>They're all ruined.</i>

460
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:18,450
I apologize.

461
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:21,166
<i>You fool.
Is that all you can say?</i>

462
00:40:21,395 --> 00:40:23,383
They're so expensive...

463
00:40:23,585 --> 00:40:26,820
You... 
Are you a shoeshiner for real?

464
00:40:27,373 --> 00:40:30,139
Today was my first day.

465
00:40:30,389 --> 00:40:33,874
When someone prances about 
as if he had any clue,

466
00:40:34,055 --> 00:40:35,820
that's a fraud, you fool!

467
00:40:36,177 --> 00:40:37,346
I'm sorry.

468
00:40:37,583 --> 00:40:40,696
Pay us back for the shoes.

469
00:40:41,403 --> 00:40:44,448
I... have no money.

470
00:40:44,638 --> 00:40:46,224
<i>You don't?</i>

471
00:40:46,692 --> 00:40:48,282
Then, can't be helped.

472
00:40:48,507 --> 00:40:51,724
Miss Kim. Call the police
and tell them to take him in.

473
00:40:51,857 --> 00:40:55,274
I'll shine your shoes every day
until I pay back the damages.

474
00:40:55,474 --> 00:40:56,928
So...

475
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:05,550
Close an eye just this once.

476
00:41:06,311 --> 00:41:10,854
Ahh... Really, is anything
ever going right here?

477
00:41:11,334 --> 00:41:14,495
Get out of my face!
Leave!

478
00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:30,249
<i>What do I have to see...</i>

479
00:41:31,387 --> 00:41:33,195
I'll go as well.

480
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,394
Jeongyeon... Jeongyeon!

481
00:41:35,492 --> 00:41:37,065
Just let her go.

482
00:41:37,176 --> 00:41:38,872
We'll just go by ourselves.

483
00:41:56,602 --> 00:41:58,584
And your mother?

484
00:41:59,978 --> 00:42:01,649
She passed away.

485
00:42:04,894 --> 00:42:07,201
You don't need to 
show compassion to me.

486
00:42:07,409 --> 00:42:10,652
And how could I not
feel compassion for you?

487
00:42:14,401 --> 00:42:16,456
You've lost your mother
and are even shining shoes.

488
00:42:16,612 --> 00:42:19,808
You're still as annoying as always.

489
00:42:20,482 --> 00:42:23,603
Same goes for you.
Arrogant as always.

490
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,957
I'm in no mood to be arguing with you.

491
00:42:39,145 --> 00:42:40,455
<i>Take it.</i>

492
00:42:41,068 --> 00:42:45,130
It's the money I couldn't give you, 
when I lost my wallet.

493
00:42:47,557 --> 00:42:50,269
Why, would it hurt 
your pride to accept it?

494
00:42:50,413 --> 00:42:52,059
Forget it, then.

495
00:43:20,648 --> 00:43:22,036
Give me back my box!

496
00:43:22,156 --> 00:43:24,812
- My box!
- Out of the way, you pricks!

497
00:43:25,725 --> 00:43:27,324
My box!

498
00:43:27,889 --> 00:43:30,258
How dare you?
Who the hell are you?

499
00:43:30,370 --> 00:43:32,691
- Give me back my box!
- You bastard.

500
00:43:32,769 --> 00:43:36,118
<i>Wanna die?
Do you have a death wish?</i>

501
00:43:44,115 --> 00:43:46,057
Ahh... You annoying twit...

502
00:43:48,694 --> 00:43:52,636
You... Show up around me again,

503
00:43:52,996 --> 00:43:55,749
and I'll cripple you for good.

504
00:44:20,304 --> 00:44:21,207
Stop it.

505
00:44:21,330 --> 00:44:22,013
Move!

506
00:44:22,121 --> 00:44:24,131
I can just buy another box for you.

507
00:44:24,251 --> 00:44:25,995
And who the hell are you?

508
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:32,844
They're the ones who
ruined my polish box.

509
00:44:33,361 --> 00:44:36,461
Still, why would you do this?
You'll only end up getting hurt.

510
00:44:36,605 --> 00:44:44,505
Both my parents died, 
and I lost my brothers and sister.

511
00:44:45,299 --> 00:44:48,495
I have nothing left to lose,
and nothing can hurt me anymore.

512
00:44:55,228 --> 00:44:57,992
Hurry up and clean that, will you?

513
00:44:58,208 --> 00:45:00,251
We don't have all day.

514
00:45:00,395 --> 00:45:02,077
Th...There!

515
00:45:15,276 --> 00:45:17,257
You can come any time, you bastard.

516
00:45:17,449 --> 00:45:19,276
I, Park Sotae!

517
00:45:19,708 --> 00:45:24,864
I've sent dozens of blockheads
like you to hell already.

518
00:45:50,193 --> 00:45:52,116
Please, stop.

519
00:46:00,062 --> 00:46:04,212
You idiot!
Keep this up and they'll kill you!

520
00:46:32,374 --> 00:46:34,885
Don't stare at me, I don't like it.

521
00:46:35,234 --> 00:46:37,726
Why, think I'm enjoying this?

522
00:46:39,216 --> 00:46:41,306
You blockhead...

523
00:46:42,449 --> 00:46:45,429
That's what he told you earlier on. 
That you're a blockhead.

524
00:46:45,586 --> 00:46:47,641
He really has a point.

525
00:46:47,797 --> 00:46:51,458
<i>You're foolish and stupid,
not to mention stubborn as hell.</i>

526
00:46:52,047 --> 00:46:53,345
Where are you going?

527
00:46:53,513 --> 00:46:55,183
I'm not done.

528
00:46:55,327 --> 00:46:57,106
You're going after them again?

529
00:46:57,310 --> 00:46:58,596
Thank you for the meal.

530
00:46:58,776 --> 00:47:01,333
Hey, you blockhead!

531
00:47:10,784 --> 00:47:12,506
What the hell are you doing?

532
00:47:16,012 --> 00:47:18,039
Go ahead and come get some!

533
00:47:18,183 --> 00:47:19,710
I'll set the whole damned place on fire!

534
00:47:19,822 --> 00:47:22,197
You... Drop that!

535
00:47:22,725 --> 00:47:24,202
Give me my box back.

536
00:47:24,372 --> 00:47:26,294
You really have a death wish, uh?

537
00:47:26,451 --> 00:47:31,833
Sure, go ahead.
Let's all kill each other!

538
00:47:35,895 --> 00:47:36,916
Don't, you fool...

539
00:47:37,037 --> 00:47:37,710
Why?

540
00:47:37,818 --> 00:47:42,553
You burn someone else's box to shreds,
and you're scared I'll burn your tent?

541
00:47:43,821 --> 00:47:45,119
I'm sorry.

542
00:47:45,287 --> 00:47:46,592
I beg you, don't do it.

543
00:47:46,789 --> 00:47:47,884
"I'm sorry"?!

544
00:47:47,976 --> 00:47:51,580
Yeah... I shouldn't have done it,
so please don't kick that.

545
00:47:51,708 --> 00:47:54,697
If you set the tent on fire,
we'll all become beggars!

546
00:47:54,829 --> 00:47:55,959
Give me my box back.

547
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:58,413
All right, I'll buy you a new one.

548
00:47:58,557 --> 00:47:59,807
So, please... Stop.

549
00:47:59,951 --> 00:48:03,040
Also, from now on
I'll shine shoes here, too.

550
00:48:03,196 --> 00:48:04,193
What?

551
00:48:04,446 --> 00:48:06,231
Ahh... Damned blockhead...

552
00:48:06,404 --> 00:48:07,738
Are you against it?

553
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:11,410
Then, we can just all become beggars...

554
00:48:12,396 --> 00:48:15,652
Fine, work here.
It's all right, shine them...

555
00:48:15,845 --> 00:48:17,167
Shine them all you want.

556
00:48:17,323 --> 00:48:20,483
And I'm not paying a penny, 
just so you know.

557
00:48:20,616 --> 00:48:24,571
Ahh... He's scary...
What did I do to deserve this?

558
00:48:25,196 --> 00:48:26,853
All right.

559
00:48:27,143 --> 00:48:29,823
We'll do everything you asked,

560
00:48:30,003 --> 00:48:31,625
so get out of there!

561
00:48:31,781 --> 00:48:32,791
You mean it?

562
00:48:32,911 --> 00:48:34,521
I'm a man, too!

563
00:48:34,654 --> 00:48:38,520
Everyone is looking,
would I go back on my word?

564
00:48:48,773 --> 00:48:51,800
I'm Park Sotae.
You?

565
00:48:52,107 --> 00:48:53,249
Gangmo.

566
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:54,577
Lee Gangmo.

567
00:48:54,727 --> 00:48:58,488
Forget all the bullshit,
and work under me.

568
00:48:58,633 --> 00:49:00,543
I don't want to work under you.

569
00:49:00,712 --> 00:49:01,841
Let's be partners.

570
00:49:01,985 --> 00:49:02,839
Partners?!

571
00:49:02,947 --> 00:49:07,089
Right. We make money
together, and share it.

572
00:49:11,595 --> 00:49:12,580
Fine.

573
00:49:12,761 --> 00:49:14,443
<i>We have a deal.</i>

574
00:49:20,008 --> 00:49:23,096
Never seen a blockhead like you before.

575
00:49:40,393 --> 00:49:43,475
How much longer will you make us wait?

576
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:46,344
Worst comes to worst, within a month...

577
00:49:46,458 --> 00:49:47,650
Listen, Jo Pilyeon.

578
00:49:47,758 --> 00:49:49,232
The elections are right behind the corner.

579
00:49:49,323 --> 00:49:51,604
The opposition candidate is
yapping his mouth left and right...

580
00:49:51,736 --> 00:49:58,340
criticizing the government, and the 
public is all too happy to eat it up.

581
00:49:58,629 --> 00:49:59,939
I'm well aware.

582
00:50:00,095 --> 00:50:03,688
Then, imagine if they learned that we
bought land in Gangnam under a namesake.

583
00:50:03,824 --> 00:50:06,380
Not only the president, 
but everyone here would be screwed!

584
00:50:06,524 --> 00:50:08,494
Calm down.

585
00:50:09,865 --> 00:50:11,740
One month is too late.

586
00:50:11,872 --> 00:50:15,297
You must get your hands on that 
document within the next ten days.

587
00:50:15,465 --> 00:50:18,505
Only then will we be able
to stop the Americans...

588
00:50:18,661 --> 00:50:21,410
from disclosing the namesake
account list to the public.

589
00:50:22,110 --> 00:50:24,704
I will spare no effort.

590
00:50:24,798 --> 00:50:27,780
Whatever it takes, you must succeed.

591
00:50:27,925 --> 00:50:28,778
You have ten days!

592
00:50:28,898 --> 00:50:30,985
Go even a single day over that deadline,

593
00:50:31,289 --> 00:50:33,626
and you'd better be prepared
for the consequences.

594
00:50:47,493 --> 00:50:48,658
It's tomorrow.

595
00:50:48,814 --> 00:50:52,040
Tomorrow, Michael will take
the document and leave the base.

596
00:50:52,761 --> 00:50:55,114
We have no other choice, do we?

597
00:50:55,417 --> 00:50:57,940
Before that document
leaves for the States,

598
00:50:58,157 --> 00:51:00,356
we must get our hands on it at all cost.

599
00:51:00,668 --> 00:51:02,627
I still can't figure it out.

600
00:51:03,132 --> 00:51:06,743
Whether that intel is legit,

601
00:51:06,947 --> 00:51:10,096
or just a bait to lure us into a trap.

602
00:51:26,579 --> 00:51:32,604
<i>~ Jo Pilyeon ~</i>

603
00:52:04,017 --> 00:52:07,346
Captain Michael just left the base.

604
00:52:08,187 --> 00:52:10,510
I will trail him.

605
00:52:10,747 --> 00:52:11,852
It's our last chance.

606
00:52:11,946 --> 00:52:14,540
Issue your order now!

607
00:52:17,701 --> 00:52:18,933
Go.

608
00:52:19,311 --> 00:52:22,327
Go, and get that document.

609
00:52:41,639 --> 00:52:43,141
Assistant!

610
00:52:43,405 --> 00:52:44,331
Assistant!

611
00:52:44,424 --> 00:52:45,597
<i>Yes!</i>

612
00:52:46,049 --> 00:52:47,479
Go get Jaechun, quick!

613
00:52:47,611 --> 00:52:48,813
Yes, Sir.

614
00:52:51,609 --> 00:52:55,010
<i>It's false intel, don't fall for it.</i>

615
00:53:28,334 --> 00:53:30,245
Who's the man?

616
00:54:17,268 --> 00:54:19,166
That black boxer is really something.

617
00:54:19,323 --> 00:54:23,985
Well, I've never seen a Korean
soldier able to bring him down.

618
00:54:24,298 --> 00:54:28,904
Why don't we choose two representatives
and have a real match sometime?

619
00:54:29,142 --> 00:54:32,074
You really think a Korean
can take an American down?

620
00:54:32,266 --> 00:54:33,672
In boxing?!

621
00:54:34,381 --> 00:54:36,400
I see you're confident.

622
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:41,581
Come on, yellow monkeys!

623
00:54:43,242 --> 00:54:44,876
You!

624
00:54:46,042 --> 00:54:47,303
What?

625
00:54:47,568 --> 00:54:49,334
You're scared?

626
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:52,550
You wanna fight?

627
00:55:07,011 --> 00:55:08,694
Who's the man?

628
00:55:16,308 --> 00:55:17,914
<i>Who is this?</i>

629
00:55:34,690 --> 00:55:36,600
Are you out of your mind?

630
00:55:36,759 --> 00:55:38,697
Come down, you fool!

631
00:55:39,303 --> 00:55:43,571
I better not get locked up for
knocking out a yellow monkey today.

632
00:56:49,949 --> 00:56:51,597
Get up!

633
00:56:52,126 --> 00:56:53,532
I said get up!

634
00:56:53,700 --> 00:57:03,626
<i>Get up! Get up!</i>

635
00:58:55,780 --> 00:59:04,228
<i>Get up! Get up!</i>

636
00:59:57,981 --> 01:00:00,447
<i>Your fighting spirit is really impressive.</i>

637
01:00:02,569 --> 01:00:04,708
It was an entertaining fight.

638
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:10,224
Give me my jackknife back.

639
01:00:11,486 --> 01:00:16,078
Your aide must have my knife.

640
01:00:17,244 --> 01:00:22,099
There's a peculiar fella inside this base.

641
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:29,650
Where he was born, how he grew up,
how old he is, his name...

642
01:00:30,588 --> 01:00:36,176
Why he is helping me,
or whether he's just trying to kill me.

643
01:00:36,332 --> 01:00:42,350
There's this phantom-like
presence I can't really figure out.

644
01:00:44,598 --> 01:00:45,739
Who are you?

645
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:47,494
How did you get here?

646
01:00:47,674 --> 01:00:49,524
Why did you lie,
saying he wasn't the culprit?

647
01:00:49,693 --> 01:00:51,849
And why did you send me that note?

648
01:00:52,084 --> 01:00:55,003
Who the hell are you?

649
01:00:59,836 --> 01:01:01,929
I'm a Korean.

650
01:01:03,694 --> 01:01:04,427
What?

651
01:01:04,595 --> 01:01:06,542
Just like you,

652
01:01:06,766 --> 01:01:09,169
I'm a Korean man.

653
01:01:14,842 --> 01:01:16,993
There is no other reason.

654
01:01:18,086 --> 01:01:20,569
And that's because I'm no American.

655
01:01:21,386 --> 01:01:26,361
Because we are all fellow Koreans.

656
01:01:30,002 --> 01:01:31,504
Stop.

657
01:02:01,851 --> 01:02:03,690
I've heard he's got amnesia.

658
01:02:04,002 --> 01:02:06,730
That is why we couldn't 
verify his identity.

659
01:02:07,331 --> 01:02:11,129
<i>If dealt with properly,
he's a potential gem.</i>

660
01:02:11,317 --> 01:02:12,607
What?

661
01:02:14,759 --> 01:02:16,946
If we use him well,

662
01:02:17,811 --> 01:02:20,683
he will become a
great commodity for us.

663
01:02:31,617 --> 01:02:34,261
Weather isn't helping today, again.

664
01:02:35,090 --> 01:02:39,867
But, where the hell is Gangmo?
Haven't seen him all day.

665
01:02:41,021 --> 01:02:42,752
I'll be damned...

666
01:02:46,958 --> 01:02:48,940
You really are doing this for free?

667
01:02:49,121 --> 01:02:50,551
Of course.

668
01:02:50,698 --> 01:02:54,350
To pay you back for the shoes I ruined, 
it'll take more than a year.

669
01:02:54,554 --> 01:02:56,502
- You little...
- Be quiet.

670
01:02:56,644 --> 01:03:00,246
<i>"As it's expected the rain
will continue until tonight,"</i>

671
01:03:00,362 --> 01:03:04,805
<i>"low-lying areas around the Han River
are expected to suffer serious damage."</i>

672
01:03:05,051 --> 01:03:10,604
<i>"We alert all people in the area to
be prepared and react accordingly."</i>

673
01:03:10,729 --> 01:03:13,293
<i>"And that closes today's weather report."</i>

674
01:03:19,049 --> 01:03:20,422
It's me.

675
01:03:20,637 --> 01:03:23,042
Why aren't you answering my calls?

676
01:03:23,305 --> 01:03:24,880
How's the situation there?

677
01:03:25,661 --> 01:03:26,703
What?

678
01:03:26,946 --> 01:03:28,256
Hey... Hey!

679
01:03:28,413 --> 01:03:32,401
<i>If the river floods,
what about all that sand?</i>

680
01:03:33,255 --> 01:03:35,814
Does that make any sense?

681
01:03:36,004 --> 01:03:40,823
Mobilize all workforce, and block it 
yourselves if that's what it takes!

682
01:03:41,412 --> 01:03:44,115
All the employees already went home, 
and there's no one left.

683
01:03:44,207 --> 01:03:45,643
<i>Say what?</i>

684
01:03:45,906 --> 01:03:48,482
<i>Are you out of your mind?</i>

685
01:03:48,638 --> 01:03:53,369
How can you send people home, 
during a state of emergency?

686
01:03:53,553 --> 01:03:59,090
I'll head there right away,
so gather everyone you can.

687
01:04:00,371 --> 01:04:02,930
You foolish twat...

688
01:04:03,219 --> 01:04:06,003
Everyone, follow me.

689
01:04:06,235 --> 01:04:08,038
Me too, Director?

690
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:10,933
Why, aren't you getting paid?

691
01:04:11,198 --> 01:04:13,182
Everyone!

692
01:04:18,073 --> 01:04:19,767
I'm coming, too.

693
01:04:31,260 --> 01:04:35,346
Come on, let's hurry!
We have no time.

694
01:04:35,973 --> 01:04:42,075
Let's move, hurry up!
There is no time!

695
01:04:42,544 --> 01:04:45,368
Director, the dike
is about to collapse!

696
01:04:45,632 --> 01:04:49,169
So what? Can't you see all
this sand wasted in vain?

697
01:04:49,259 --> 01:04:51,818
If the dike collapses, then the
water will flood the entire place!

698
01:04:51,917 --> 01:04:53,011
You crazy fool!

699
01:04:53,095 --> 01:04:55,546
Isn't that why I asked you
to make an embankment?

700
01:04:55,655 --> 01:04:59,119
This will never be enough!
You might even risk your...

701
01:04:59,220 --> 01:05:03,006
You little... You're doing this 
because it's not your money, right?

702
01:05:04,208 --> 01:05:09,092
This might only look like sand to you,

703
01:05:09,249 --> 01:05:11,645
but this is my flesh and blood!

704
01:05:11,808 --> 01:05:15,937
If all this is wasted,
I'll be dead anyway!

705
01:05:16,029 --> 01:05:17,499
Calm down, Director.

706
01:05:17,592 --> 01:05:19,668
Doing this will not solve a thing!

707
01:05:19,776 --> 01:05:21,865
Forget it, you fools!

708
01:05:22,117 --> 01:05:25,638
I'll do it myself,
so get out of my face!

709
01:05:25,770 --> 01:05:27,619
Director!

710
01:05:27,732 --> 01:05:31,959
Director!
It's too dangerous!

711
01:05:37,968 --> 01:05:42,436
If this collapses, it's all over!

712
01:05:42,604 --> 01:05:45,801
Think I'm going to give up
after all I went through?

713
01:05:53,843 --> 01:06:00,964
I even had to kill to get to this point!

714
01:06:01,241 --> 01:06:05,999
I'm not going to let a 
natural disaster ruin me! I won't!

715
01:06:06,131 --> 01:06:08,325
Come get some!

716
01:06:08,429 --> 01:06:11,611
I'm Hwang Taeseop!

717
01:06:11,912 --> 01:06:15,090
I'm afraid of nothing!
