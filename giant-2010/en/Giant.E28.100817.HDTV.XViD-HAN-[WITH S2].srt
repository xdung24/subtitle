{\a6}- Episode 28 -

4
00:00:06,795 --> 00:00:08,545
Gangmo!

5
00:00:08,905 --> 00:00:10,718
Jeongyeon is here!

6
00:00:20,372 --> 00:00:23,617
<i>What's wrong with you?</i>

7
00:00:23,757 --> 00:00:27,706
Why, do you know these people?

8
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:31,912
I'd like to meet with the president.

9
00:00:32,551 --> 00:00:35,750
Our president still isn't back
from his business trip abroad?!

10
00:00:35,837 --> 00:00:39,198
Then, there must be someone
responsible on his behalf.

11
00:00:39,286 --> 00:00:41,935
I'd be the man responsible here.

12
00:00:42,019 --> 00:00:44,611
Why, did you come here
to sign a contract?

13
00:00:44,786 --> 00:00:49,165
But what can we do now? Only the
president takes care of contracts?!

14
00:00:49,296 --> 00:00:51,097
Let's go talk inside, for starters.

15
00:00:51,228 --> 00:00:52,727
Ehh Ehh!

16
00:00:52,843 --> 00:00:55,317
How dare you boss your way around...

17
00:00:55,535 --> 00:00:59,813
So these folks are
from Manbo Construction?

18
00:00:59,988 --> 00:01:01,763
Likely?!

19
00:01:01,996 --> 00:01:04,105
<i>You know, our president?</i>

20
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:08,746
He said he's not going to deal with
Manbo Construction no matter what.

21
00:01:08,877 --> 00:01:12,724
So don't try to get us into trouble,

22
00:01:12,877 --> 00:01:16,308
and go before I forget
I ever had manners.

23
00:01:21,675 --> 00:01:23,487
Shideok!

24
00:01:25,196 --> 00:01:26,853
Director!

25
00:01:30,798 --> 00:01:33,458
Why did you come here yourself?

26
00:01:34,072 --> 00:01:37,932
Hangang Construction's
president still isn't back.

27
00:01:40,332 --> 00:01:44,828
I'd like to know why he
refuses to do business with us?

28
00:01:46,662 --> 00:01:51,493
Because they already signed an exclusive
deal with Gwangmyeong Construction,

29
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:56,144
they can't sign with anyone else.

30
00:02:00,226 --> 00:02:03,536
I suggest we just go back.

31
00:03:04,512 --> 00:03:10,202
What would have Gangmo done
in this situation?

32
00:03:12,428 --> 00:03:17,841
I really wanted to make a
good impression with this project...

33
00:03:19,151 --> 00:03:22,163
If only Gangmo could be by my side,

34
00:03:23,472 --> 00:03:27,212
things would have
never gotten to this point.

35
00:03:35,233 --> 00:03:36,625
<i>Listen to you... Lee Gangmo!</i>

36
00:03:36,741 --> 00:03:39,593
<i>Do you know why Jeongyeon
has been living that way?</i>

37
00:03:39,797 --> 00:03:42,351
<i>It was only to avenge you!</i>

38
00:03:42,453 --> 00:03:45,894
<i>To make Minwoo and Jeongshik
pay for what they did to you.</i>

39
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:51,292
She even caught aphasia,
shocked about your death.

40
00:03:52,473 --> 00:03:56,822
Seeing her struggle so much by
herself on that construction site...

41
00:03:57,287 --> 00:04:00,659
It's so hard to bear,
it brings me to tears.

42
00:04:20,271 --> 00:04:21,376
<i>What?!</i>

43
00:04:21,474 --> 00:04:25,012
Park Sotae works for
Hangang Construction?!

44
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:28,882
How did he manage to survive,
not to mention end up there?

45
00:04:29,071 --> 00:04:32,709
The man who now owns Lee Gangmo's
Gaepo-Dong mudflats...

46
00:04:32,971 --> 00:04:34,993
is James Lee.

47
00:04:35,182 --> 00:04:37,336
Yeah... I know that.

48
00:04:37,496 --> 00:04:40,745
And turns out that the president
of Hangang Construction...

49
00:04:41,225 --> 00:04:43,277
is exactly that James fella.

50
00:04:43,422 --> 00:04:45,052
Really?

51
00:04:46,496 --> 00:04:50,872
But... Never seen two people
with the same name before?

52
00:04:51,047 --> 00:04:54,422
I've even heard James is the
most common name in the States.

53
00:04:54,826 --> 00:04:59,162
Park Sotae is the man we sent
to prison to kill Lee Gangmo.

54
00:05:00,928 --> 00:05:02,902
Hey... Then, by any chance...

55
00:05:03,018 --> 00:05:05,914
And Shideok was acting strange as well.

56
00:05:06,685 --> 00:05:08,940
Maybe that James...

57
00:05:10,119 --> 00:05:12,428
could in fact be Lee Gangmo.

58
00:05:14,341 --> 00:05:17,986
Hey... No matter how you put it,
there's no way.

59
00:05:18,175 --> 00:05:21,705
Gangmo died.
We even got his death notice.

60
00:05:21,825 --> 00:05:25,509
My father spread his ashes into
the river, what are you saying?

61
00:05:27,988 --> 00:05:31,248
I agree that Park Sotae's
involvement is a little suspicious,

62
00:05:31,393 --> 00:05:33,459
but it can't be Lee Gangmo, no way.

63
00:05:33,605 --> 00:05:37,617
How can you come back from the dead?
It makes no sense.

64
00:05:48,655 --> 00:05:53,122
I wanted to talk with
you myself, Chairman Hwang.

65
00:05:53,282 --> 00:05:54,781
Commissioner.

66
00:05:54,926 --> 00:05:59,029
Why are you doing this to us?

67
00:05:59,384 --> 00:06:03,391
You can't allow any
additional budget resources?!

68
00:06:03,767 --> 00:06:06,665
As you're well aware, there will soon
be a probe into congress spending, and...

69
00:06:06,782 --> 00:06:11,816
Do I look like the kind of man who
would take those excuses at face value?

70
00:06:11,991 --> 00:06:15,838
If you refuse to believe me,
then that's your prerogative.

71
00:06:16,514 --> 00:06:23,712
We go such a long way back,
you of all people can't do this to me.

72
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:28,271
That's exactly what I'd like
to tell you, on the contrary.

73
00:06:29,274 --> 00:06:30,437
What?

74
00:06:30,545 --> 00:06:36,737
Didn't I warn you more than once to
cut your ties with Candidate Jo Pilyeon?

75
00:06:39,003 --> 00:06:44,997
Because I support Min Honggi,
Jo Pilyeon bears ill will against me.

76
00:06:45,275 --> 00:06:47,922
If you really thought of me as an ally,

77
00:06:48,358 --> 00:06:53,186
you would have renounced further dealings
with Jo Pilyeon while you still could.

78
00:06:53,419 --> 00:06:59,530
So was that the real
reason behind all this?

79
00:07:00,505 --> 00:07:04,947
- That's the reason you're trying to bring us...
- I see we're done talking,

80
00:07:05,107 --> 00:07:07,057
so I'll have to ask you to leave.

81
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:10,671
It won't go as you think!

82
00:07:16,442 --> 00:07:20,544
Seems like you're looking
down on me just because...

83
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,196
I've always treated you
with meek obedience,

84
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:29,110
but you'll never take that
highway project away from me!

85
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,623
Is that so?

86
00:07:31,088 --> 00:07:32,340
Shall I give it a try, then?

87
00:07:32,427 --> 00:07:36,560
You won't keep this post forever.

88
00:07:36,818 --> 00:07:38,003
What?

89
00:07:38,178 --> 00:07:41,245
So you're going to mess with me?

90
00:07:41,492 --> 00:07:43,166
Be my guest, then!

91
00:07:43,369 --> 00:07:46,702
Think I can't get you fired
if I really want to?

92
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,703
- Dad...
- Listen, Chairman Hwang!

93
00:07:49,812 --> 00:07:51,809
I apologize, Commissioner.

94
00:07:51,898 --> 00:07:54,303
Let's just go, Dad.

95
00:08:03,936 --> 00:08:06,249
You've gone too far, Dad.

96
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:08,505
He was the first to betray me.

97
00:08:08,607 --> 00:08:11,570
Still, we're dealing with
the head of the City Council.

98
00:08:11,701 --> 00:08:13,940
So what was I supposed to do,

99
00:08:14,158 --> 00:08:16,763
hold his trousers like a miserable
lackey and beg my way out of it?

100
00:08:16,894 --> 00:08:18,844
- Dad...
- Do you even realize...

101
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,074
why I spent so much money on
those big shots all these years?

102
00:08:22,278 --> 00:08:24,751
It was to avoid facing
such embarrassments.

103
00:08:24,911 --> 00:08:29,374
So that I wouldn't have to
hang from those sharks' lips.

104
00:08:31,449 --> 00:08:33,740
Even business is all about politics.

105
00:08:34,031 --> 00:08:39,519
Once Jo Pilyeon wins the elections,
you'll see how quickly he'll be tamed.

106
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,848
What?!

107
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:52,471
You will get me fired?

108
00:08:58,436 --> 00:08:59,790
Yes.

109
00:08:59,952 --> 00:09:00,662
<i>It's me, Sir.</i>

110
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:03,980
- Hangang Construction's...
- Ohh... President Lee.

111
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:06,337
<i>Have you made up your mind?</i>

112
00:09:07,283 --> 00:09:09,618
<i>If you really wish for me to
help Manbo Construction...</i>

113
00:09:09,713 --> 00:09:10,717
No.

114
00:09:10,877 --> 00:09:12,666
There's no need to do that.

115
00:09:13,801 --> 00:09:16,877
<i>Manbo Construction will soon have
to deal with an on-site supervision.</i>

116
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:20,107
<i>We can reopen negotiations
on the highway project...</i>

117
00:09:20,282 --> 00:09:21,853
<i>once the supervision results are out.</i>

118
00:09:22,042 --> 00:09:23,693
I understand.

119
00:09:42,441 --> 00:09:45,235
He refuses to speak to the very end.

120
00:09:46,509 --> 00:09:49,096
Is he just afraid of Jo Pilyeon?

121
00:09:49,271 --> 00:09:50,624
<i>That's part of the problem,</i>

122
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:54,538
<i>but he also likely believes
Jo might come to his rescue.</i>

123
00:09:54,712 --> 00:09:57,666
To derail Jo Pilyeon's campaign,

124
00:09:57,841 --> 00:10:01,697
we must make him confess at all cost.

125
00:10:02,888 --> 00:10:04,771
<i>Considering the situation,</i>

126
00:10:05,033 --> 00:10:09,267
it would be wiser to just
make him join forces with us.

127
00:10:09,596 --> 00:10:11,741
Join forces?!

128
00:10:12,354 --> 00:10:14,757
Is there such a way?

129
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:20,851
<i>- Days Before the Elections -</i>

130
00:10:21,011 --> 00:10:26,206
All sample surveys put us
well ahead of Min Honggi.

131
00:10:26,526 --> 00:10:33,234
And also, Honey... Take a look at the
polls we ran ourselves, you're first.

132
00:10:33,403 --> 00:10:34,980
Good job, everyone.

133
00:10:35,169 --> 00:10:39,749
Now we can just relax
and wait for the counting.

134
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,463
What brings you here?

135
00:10:44,623 --> 00:10:47,635
Let's have a word next door,
if you don't mind.

136
00:10:53,555 --> 00:10:58,002
By any chance, is that Choi Taewook
in Seoul, at the moment?

137
00:10:58,731 --> 00:10:59,916
And how do you know that?

138
00:11:00,017 --> 00:11:01,865
Intel from the ANSP.

139
00:11:02,171 --> 00:11:04,936
Jaechun, hurry up
and get him into hiding.

140
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:08,952
Actually, I've lost contact
with him these last few days.

141
00:11:09,097 --> 00:11:10,203
What's that supposed to mean?

142
00:11:10,334 --> 00:11:12,517
It does look like he left Cheongju,

143
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:15,311
but I have never seen him in Seoul.

144
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,148
You foolish idiot!

145
00:11:18,308 --> 00:11:21,858
How can you not be
aware of his whereabouts?

146
00:11:22,018 --> 00:11:23,663
It can't be helped.

147
00:11:23,866 --> 00:11:25,349
Before any other agent
gets his hands on him,

148
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,764
I'll be forced to catch him myself.

149
00:11:27,983 --> 00:11:29,074
Can you do that for me?

150
00:11:29,219 --> 00:11:31,543
What else can we do?!

151
00:11:31,695 --> 00:11:34,021
All right...
I owe you one, Seongmo.

152
00:11:34,123 --> 00:11:35,738
But even if we do catch him,
that doesn't solve anything.

153
00:11:35,825 --> 00:11:39,885
What do you plan to do
with that Choi Taewook?

154
00:11:41,246 --> 00:11:43,211
We must get rid of him.

155
00:11:44,474 --> 00:11:48,595
I can't forfeit my seat in congress
because of that useless minion.

156
00:11:48,798 --> 00:11:52,785
Killing him is the only way
to avoid any future complications.

157
00:12:00,603 --> 00:12:02,519
How did it go?

158
00:12:09,076 --> 00:12:10,981
Seonbaenim.

159
00:12:12,071 --> 00:12:13,752
Let's go.

160
00:12:14,661 --> 00:12:18,590
Tiger hunting begins now.

161
00:12:31,567 --> 00:12:35,790
Why don't you just go by the book?

162
00:12:36,242 --> 00:12:39,745
And also, just because I
beat up a few displaced fools,

163
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:42,044
can you reduce people to this state?

164
00:12:42,233 --> 00:12:44,328
All we need from you is the truth.

165
00:12:44,546 --> 00:12:47,321
Who instigated you?

166
00:12:50,707 --> 00:12:52,671
Have no idea.

167
00:12:53,108 --> 00:12:56,018
- I don't know.
- Choi Taewook!

168
00:12:56,585 --> 00:13:00,645
Do you really believe Jo Pilyeon
will do everything to protect you?

169
00:13:03,061 --> 00:13:08,053
How many times do I have to tell you
I've got nothing to do with...

170
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:15,881
<i>What do you plan to do
with that Choi Taewook?</i>

171
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:17,482
<i>We must get rid of him.</i>

172
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:21,660
<i>I can't forfeit my seat in congress
because of that useless minion.</i>

173
00:13:21,776 --> 00:13:26,273
<i>Killing him is the only way
to avoid any future complications.</i>

174
00:13:34,268 --> 00:13:37,898
Shall we go down
the list of your charges?

175
00:13:39,354 --> 00:13:41,143
Breaking election law,

176
00:13:41,318 --> 00:13:44,243
and considering you used a
lead pipe during your assault,

177
00:13:44,432 --> 00:13:47,269
that will mean attempted murder.

178
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,310
<i>What else... Escape and formation
of organized crime society,</i>

179
00:13:50,441 --> 00:13:53,712
instigation to violence, blackmail,
intimidation, racketeering,

180
00:13:53,785 --> 00:13:55,502
<i>attempted murder by contract,
perjury and so on,</i>

181
00:13:55,604 --> 00:13:58,805
for a grand total of forty-eight counts.

182
00:13:59,154 --> 00:14:00,871
<i>It's your last chance.</i>

183
00:14:01,045 --> 00:14:08,316
Confess that Jo Pilyeon instigated
your assault on that clearance area.

184
00:14:08,796 --> 00:14:14,326
Then, of those forty-eight counts,
you'll only be charged for one,

185
00:14:14,457 --> 00:14:17,381
simple assault.

186
00:14:39,877 --> 00:14:43,840
Looks like the chief
is not coming today?!

187
00:15:10,482 --> 00:15:12,556
I'm sorry.

188
00:15:17,615 --> 00:15:20,121
I'll never make you cry again.

189
00:15:22,261 --> 00:15:25,491
Aww... It's so embarrassing...

190
00:15:25,797 --> 00:15:29,326
How can I look him in the face again?

191
00:15:30,091 --> 00:15:32,267
I was insane...

192
00:15:32,413 --> 00:15:36,967
He tries to kiss me
and I just stand there...

193
00:15:40,622 --> 00:15:42,191
Chief...

194
00:15:42,424 --> 00:15:43,922
Why?

195
00:15:44,126 --> 00:15:45,462
You regret kissing me?

196
00:15:45,593 --> 00:15:49,125
Uh?! No...
I didn't mean that...

197
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:52,155
I mean... It's not like I didn't...

198
00:15:52,257 --> 00:15:53,363
So...

199
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:55,094
Like...

200
00:15:55,327 --> 00:15:56,401
It's late.

201
00:15:56,508 --> 00:15:58,543
I'll drive you home.

202
00:16:14,566 --> 00:16:17,925
Chief.

203
00:16:19,563 --> 00:16:21,525
"Minwoo."

204
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:22,507
Uh?

205
00:16:22,652 --> 00:16:26,115
Hearing you call me Chief just feels like
you're keeping your distance, I don't like it.

206
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,051
Call my name.

207
00:16:32,256 --> 00:16:34,332
Mi...

208
00:16:35,896 --> 00:16:39,221
Min... Woo...

209
00:16:40,322 --> 00:16:41,942
Forgot how to spell it?

210
00:16:42,117 --> 00:16:44,008
Want me to write it down for you?

211
00:16:44,299 --> 00:16:48,679
I can't call your name...
It makes me feel embarrassed.

212
00:16:53,114 --> 00:16:55,515
I'll get going, then.

213
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:56,956
I'll call you.

214
00:16:57,101 --> 00:16:58,411
Ahh... Right.

215
00:16:58,585 --> 00:17:01,584
I had something to give you yesterday.

216
00:17:06,145 --> 00:17:07,164
Might be a day late,

217
00:17:07,295 --> 00:17:09,492
but Happy Birthday.

218
00:17:09,827 --> 00:17:11,617
Birthday?!

219
00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:28,824
Do you know what giving a man
a necktie pin really means?

220
00:17:30,277 --> 00:17:32,450
The way I've heard it,

221
00:17:32,668 --> 00:17:36,684
it's what women give to men
when they confess to them?!

222
00:17:37,155 --> 00:17:38,081
Really?

223
00:17:38,198 --> 00:17:41,699
I just bought it without knowing?!

224
00:17:42,185 --> 00:17:43,625
But what now?

225
00:17:43,814 --> 00:17:46,005
Yesterday wasn't even my birthday.

226
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:47,292
What?

227
00:17:47,438 --> 00:17:50,304
I'm sure I read right
on that library card?

228
00:17:50,421 --> 00:17:53,826
We use the lunar
calendar in my family.

229
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:57,099
Give it back, then.

230
00:17:57,812 --> 00:18:00,824
Hey... If you gave it to me,
it's mine... How nasty...

231
00:18:00,926 --> 00:18:03,394
I'll give it to you again
on your real birthday.

232
00:18:03,627 --> 00:18:04,252
Nope.

233
00:18:04,413 --> 00:18:07,404
I don't have money
to buy you another one!

234
00:18:07,502 --> 00:18:09,462
Give it back, come on...

235
00:18:09,607 --> 00:18:10,713
I said no.

236
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:12,241
Give it here!

237
00:18:12,372 --> 00:18:14,814
Hey... How can you...

238
00:18:35,313 --> 00:18:38,193
In the heat of the moment,
I didn't do anything last time,

239
00:18:38,353 --> 00:18:41,714
but you can forget about it
unless I give you permission.

240
00:18:42,209 --> 00:18:43,126
Hey...

241
00:18:43,358 --> 00:18:46,620
Ever seen anyone
ask permission to kiss?

242
00:18:47,886 --> 00:18:49,711
You thief...

243
00:18:50,944 --> 00:18:52,368
What?

244
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:55,583
You took my first kiss away...

245
00:18:56,374 --> 00:18:57,140
Hey...

246
00:18:57,315 --> 00:18:59,483
Hey! You...

247
00:19:02,729 --> 00:19:04,630
Have a good night, Chief.

248
00:19:04,741 --> 00:19:09,207
No...
Min...woo...

249
00:19:35,252 --> 00:19:37,579
First kiss?!

250
00:19:44,218 --> 00:19:46,877
<i>- 4 - Independent JO Pilyeon -</i>

251
00:20:22,552 --> 00:20:23,886
<i>- Vote Counting Inspector -</i>

252
00:20:24,003 --> 00:20:27,175
<i>Next are the counting results
from the Gangnam district.</i>

253
00:20:27,422 --> 00:20:30,885
Beating second-placed Min Honggi
by a landslide margin,

254
00:20:31,031 --> 00:20:34,001
independent candidate Jo Pilyeon
has won the congressional elections.

255
00:20:44,794 --> 00:20:47,217
Congratulations...
Congressman Jo Pilyeon!

256
00:20:47,391 --> 00:20:48,512
Thanks, Chairman Hwang!

257
00:20:48,555 --> 00:20:50,593
Congratulations!

258
00:20:51,567 --> 00:20:54,499
- Congratulations, Sir.
- Thanks, Seongmo.

259
00:20:55,829 --> 00:20:56,978
I won!

260
00:20:57,095 --> 00:21:00,768
Jo Pilyeon finally made it!

261
00:21:00,987 --> 00:21:02,970
Applause!

262
00:21:03,098 --> 00:21:12,000
Jo Pilyeon! Jo Pilyeon!

263
00:21:24,382 --> 00:21:26,738
What did you say?

264
00:21:35,608 --> 00:21:37,156
What is the matter?

265
00:21:37,302 --> 00:21:39,353
We're the City Council's
Supervision Team.

266
00:21:39,542 --> 00:21:43,419
We'll take all your data
regarding the highway project.

267
00:21:45,602 --> 00:21:47,545
Wait a moment...

268
00:21:58,953 --> 00:21:59,716
Hello?

269
00:21:59,803 --> 00:22:04,705
<i>It's the construction site.
We have inspectors here, it's a mess!</i>

270
00:22:13,408 --> 00:22:15,037
Come on in.

271
00:22:15,328 --> 00:22:18,248
He was the main culprit in the
assault at the clearance area.

272
00:22:18,364 --> 00:22:19,761
I was contacted.

273
00:22:19,863 --> 00:22:21,725
Detective Lee. Escort him.

274
00:22:21,915 --> 00:22:23,395
Yes.

275
00:22:27,272 --> 00:22:30,063
Here are all our notes
from the investigation.

276
00:22:30,209 --> 00:22:31,679
<i>You can consult them.</i>

277
00:22:31,834 --> 00:22:33,123
Thank you.

278
00:22:36,093 --> 00:22:39,589
Didn't you file another one of these?

279
00:22:53,206 --> 00:22:56,302
Can you publish this in
tomorrow's morning edition?

280
00:22:57,932 --> 00:23:01,482
I'll just have to call all my colleagues
from the evening edition, I guess.

281
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:03,941
I'll have to get busy.

282
00:23:13,814 --> 00:23:17,830
So in the end Jo Pilyeon triumphed.

283
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:22,607
Makes you feel like we
supported Candidate Min in vain.

284
00:23:22,912 --> 00:23:29,038
There's no way Jo Pilyeon wouldn't
be aware that you supported Min.

285
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,849
So?

286
00:23:31,023 --> 00:23:34,937
I'm sure he'll attempt
some kind of retaliation.

287
00:23:38,991 --> 00:23:42,039
And you were so vocal and
confident about winning this...

288
00:23:42,199 --> 00:23:44,105
What is all this about?

289
00:23:44,309 --> 00:23:48,194
First, allow me to
apologize for this defeat.

290
00:23:49,515 --> 00:23:52,502
That's fine with me, but even
getting on your knees and begging...

291
00:23:52,604 --> 00:23:54,336
before Baekpa won't be enough.

292
00:23:54,423 --> 00:23:56,479
I have no use for apologies.

293
00:23:56,668 --> 00:23:58,589
We'll just avoid
each other from now on.

294
00:23:58,764 --> 00:24:00,815
Give this a read first.

295
00:24:01,434 --> 00:24:04,472
It's tomorrow's morning edition.

296
00:24:06,816 --> 00:24:10,482
<i>- Candidate Jo Pilyeon, Victory Might be Overturned -
Clearance Area Assault Exposed as a Ruse
- Jo Pilyeon Personally Instigated Violence -</i>

297
00:24:12,752 --> 00:24:13,742
<i>This...</i>

298
00:24:13,858 --> 00:24:17,029
What could it possibly be about?

299
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,601
What is this?

300
00:24:20,731 --> 00:24:24,393
Jo Pilyeon's victory
could be overturned?!

301
00:24:24,582 --> 00:24:26,067
<i>Cheers!</i>

302
00:24:26,183 --> 00:24:29,770
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

303
00:24:30,382 --> 00:24:33,502
This victory wouldn't have been
possible without your help.

304
00:24:33,604 --> 00:24:36,165
Thank you, Chairman Hwang.

305
00:24:36,848 --> 00:24:39,882
I'd like a word with you, Congressman.

306
00:24:40,071 --> 00:24:41,599
Go ahead and tell me.

307
00:24:41,817 --> 00:24:46,502
Actually, I've been put in
a slightly difficult position.

308
00:24:46,691 --> 00:24:49,353
Ahh... I've heard from Minwoo already.

309
00:24:49,492 --> 00:24:51,583
So inspectors from the
Supervision Team showed up?

310
00:24:51,709 --> 00:24:55,633
That is all a trick by
Commissioner Han Myeongseok.

311
00:24:55,851 --> 00:24:58,485
What are you trying to say?
A trick by Commissioner Han?!

312
00:24:58,616 --> 00:25:02,646
Commissioner Han supports Min Honggi.

313
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:05,804
Just because I support you,

314
00:25:06,007 --> 00:25:08,641
he attempted to take the
highway project away from me.

315
00:25:08,801 --> 00:25:11,876
Han Myeongseok, that fella
needs to be taught a lesson.

316
00:25:12,326 --> 00:25:13,883
Don't you worry, Chairman Hwang.

317
00:25:14,014 --> 00:25:18,365
I'll meet with him firsthand and
tell him to halt the supervision.

318
00:25:18,635 --> 00:25:20,300
Will you do that for me?

319
00:25:20,533 --> 00:25:23,021
Hell, by the next personnel changes,

320
00:25:23,166 --> 00:25:28,312
I'll have to push some buttons and
get him sacked from his position.

321
00:25:28,458 --> 00:25:33,405
If you could only do that for me,
there is nothing else I would ask for.

322
00:25:34,569 --> 00:25:35,850
<i>Let's drink.</i>

323
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:38,192
We weren't expecting
anyone at this hour?

324
00:25:38,309 --> 00:25:41,582
I'm sure it's Seongmo.
Go open the door.

325
00:25:42,732 --> 00:25:44,303
<i>I'm coming.</i>

326
00:25:44,492 --> 00:25:47,184
<i>Thank you again, Congressman.</i>

327
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:53,106
Who are you people?

328
00:25:53,221 --> 00:25:54,809
Police.

329
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:57,428
Mister Jo Pilyeon, right?

330
00:25:57,665 --> 00:25:58,601
And?

331
00:25:58,715 --> 00:26:03,664
You're under arrest for instigation to
violence and breaking the election law.

332
00:26:04,405 --> 00:26:05,450
<i>What?!</i>

333
00:26:05,562 --> 00:26:06,778
Arrest?!

334
00:26:06,909 --> 00:26:12,351
Do you people even realize
who you're dealing with?

335
00:26:12,831 --> 00:26:14,635
Let's not resist the arrest,

336
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:17,321
or you'll force us to escort you
to the station one way or another.

337
00:26:17,494 --> 00:26:18,774
Listen.

338
00:26:18,934 --> 00:26:21,299
Which station are you people from?

339
00:26:21,414 --> 00:26:22,892
Who the hell is your superior?

340
00:26:23,008 --> 00:26:24,752
Escort him out!

341
00:26:29,323 --> 00:26:30,415
Congressman!

342
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,095
You son of a bitch!

343
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,336
And you must be Go Jaechun, right?

344
00:26:34,539 --> 00:26:36,155
Take him as well!

345
00:26:36,329 --> 00:26:39,656
Let go...
Let me go, you bastard!

346
00:26:40,316 --> 00:26:44,692
I'll remember all you people.

347
00:26:45,427 --> 00:26:46,806
- Dad... Dad!
- Honey!

348
00:26:46,907 --> 00:26:50,635
Minwoo! Honey!

349
00:26:53,991 --> 00:26:55,771
What is going on here?

350
00:26:56,019 --> 00:26:58,871
Jo Pilyeon is arrested?!

351
00:26:59,002 --> 00:27:03,469
Then, what will happen
to the highway project?

352
00:27:18,225 --> 00:27:23,229
I'll just confess
I was behind the assault.

353
00:27:24,383 --> 00:27:26,243
Don't worry about me,

354
00:27:26,476 --> 00:27:28,804
get out of here and fulfill your term.

355
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:36,414
Subjecting you to this
really makes me feel ashamed.

356
00:27:37,837 --> 00:27:40,223
Ohh... Seongmo!

357
00:27:43,345 --> 00:27:45,071
How did it go?

358
00:27:45,912 --> 00:27:47,760
I think the higher-ups got involved.

359
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,044
If it's the higher-ups,
they're all people I know.

360
00:27:50,234 --> 00:27:52,183
Who was behind this?

361
00:27:52,314 --> 00:27:55,156
Min Honggi has his connections as well.

362
00:27:55,330 --> 00:28:01,471
Not to mention that having the
ruling party's support gives him an edge.

363
00:28:03,479 --> 00:28:05,763
I was much too careless.

364
00:28:05,952 --> 00:28:10,522
Despite the fact I know who I was
dealing with better than anyone.

365
00:28:10,668 --> 00:28:12,632
It was foolish of me.

366
00:28:12,879 --> 00:28:18,088
If you're sentenced, you'll be
deprived of your seat in congress.

367
00:28:18,278 --> 00:28:19,543
Don't you worry.

368
00:28:19,689 --> 00:28:21,901
I'll take all the blame for this.

369
00:28:22,046 --> 00:28:27,853
Choi Taewook already testified.

370
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:34,640
Are you telling me the
investigation is already over?

371
00:28:58,049 --> 00:29:04,495
It's already all written in this
investigation report by the ANSP.

372
00:29:05,932 --> 00:29:10,629
Go Jaechun keeps claiming
he alone was behind this,

373
00:29:10,819 --> 00:29:14,551
but we have both a witness
and enough evidence in our hands.

374
00:29:15,002 --> 00:29:20,269
Even if you keep denying
those charges, it'll be useless.

375
00:29:25,915 --> 00:29:28,840
Leave Go Jaechun out of this.

376
00:29:29,499 --> 00:29:31,745
Not just him,

377
00:29:31,964 --> 00:29:38,351
but also everyone else from my
camp who was involved with this.

378
00:29:39,035 --> 00:29:42,658
Then, are you going to plead guilty?

379
00:29:42,847 --> 00:29:47,470
I have more experience
than you in this circle.

380
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:51,835
After I've met with my lawyer,

381
00:29:52,024 --> 00:29:55,342
I'll follow your wishes.

382
00:30:06,757 --> 00:30:10,734
The trade meeting at
City Hall will soon begin.

383
00:30:12,116 --> 00:30:14,197
And Chief Jo?

384
00:30:14,619 --> 00:30:17,980
He went to the trial.

385
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:24,911
At the meeting today, they're going
to publish the supervision results.

386
00:30:25,027 --> 00:30:28,170
<i>Go there for me.</i>

387
00:30:30,003 --> 00:30:35,096
Wrap it up on my behalf,

388
00:30:35,944 --> 00:30:37,719
and then come back.

389
00:30:39,974 --> 00:30:42,201
All right, Dad.

390
00:30:49,672 --> 00:30:53,311
Jo Pilyeon's election trial
just concluded.

391
00:30:53,791 --> 00:30:55,683
How did it go?

392
00:30:55,887 --> 00:30:58,055
He was sentenced.

393
00:30:58,215 --> 00:31:03,337
As he got a one-year sentence, he will
be deprived of his congress seat as well.

394
00:31:13,009 --> 00:31:15,755
Leave me alone, will you?

395
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:24,875
<i>- 14th Highway Construction Trade Meeting -</i>

396
00:31:27,581 --> 00:31:30,186
How is everyone?

397
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:36,661
Didn't Chairman Hwang Taeseop come?

398
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,338
I came here on his behalf.

399
00:31:42,576 --> 00:31:49,400
Then, we'll begin with the results of
Manbo Construction's on-site supervision.

400
00:31:49,795 --> 00:31:53,285
<i>Basing their decision
upon four distinct criteria,</i>

401
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:56,501
the team concludes
that Manbo Construction...

402
00:31:56,755 --> 00:31:59,540
is not suited to complete this project.

403
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:06,613
Consequentially, as the City Council was
impressed by their reasonable estimates...

404
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:09,924
and their revolutionary
construction method,

405
00:32:10,103 --> 00:32:15,674
we decided to entrust the rest of
this project to Gwangmyeong Construction.

406
00:32:16,911 --> 00:32:18,279
We did it!

407
00:32:18,337 --> 00:32:21,539
<i>- Congratulations.
- Congratulations, Chairman.</i>

408
00:32:23,153 --> 00:32:27,593
I'd like the representatives of
both companies to come forward,

409
00:32:27,746 --> 00:32:31,137
and sign this
memorandum of understanding.

410
00:33:03,266 --> 00:33:05,797
Go ahead and seal it.

411
00:34:10,477 --> 00:34:12,643
What's the matter?

412
00:34:13,703 --> 00:34:15,793
I'm sure...

413
00:34:17,257 --> 00:34:19,925
I'm sure that was Gangmo.

414
00:34:20,201 --> 00:34:22,326
What?

415
00:34:23,188 --> 00:34:26,051
I have no doubt it was him.

416
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:31,985
Gangmo...

417
00:34:33,319 --> 00:34:35,695
Gangmo!

418
00:34:36,161 --> 00:34:38,518
You just saw things.

419
00:34:38,678 --> 00:34:41,195
Let's go.

420
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:47,345
Gangmo.

421
00:34:48,058 --> 00:34:50,502
Gangmo!

422
00:34:52,219 --> 00:34:54,606
<i>Gangmo!</i>

423
00:35:19,036 --> 00:35:21,044
<i>Honey.</i>

424
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,255
Congressman.

425
00:35:25,836 --> 00:35:27,402
Are you all right, Honey?

426
00:35:27,562 --> 00:35:29,672
Are they making it hard
for you in any way?

427
00:35:29,876 --> 00:35:31,875
I'm perfectly fine.

428
00:35:33,888 --> 00:35:36,924
How can a man have that expression?

429
00:35:38,356 --> 00:35:42,613
Now that I think about it, my life
was in need of a little incitement.

430
00:35:42,817 --> 00:35:46,165
I've been winning for so long,
I lost sight of the big picture.

431
00:35:46,658 --> 00:35:50,702
Nothing can incite you
like a little suffering.

432
00:35:51,917 --> 00:35:53,954
Dad...

433
00:35:54,958 --> 00:35:59,877
And one day this same suffering will
become the medal heralding my triumph.

434
00:36:01,011 --> 00:36:02,990
You just wait, Minwoo.

435
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:07,527
<i>The day that medal pierces this chest,</i>

436
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:11,048
it will bring forth indescribable
suffering upon those...

437
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:17,494
who are now screaming in joy,
believing they've defeated me.

438
00:36:17,741 --> 00:36:19,502
<i>Honey...</i>

439
00:36:19,706 --> 00:36:21,940
Honey...

440
00:36:23,558 --> 00:36:25,767
Don't show weakness to anyone.

441
00:36:25,927 --> 00:36:30,132
Jo Pilyeon's wife should be
able to control her emotions.

442
00:36:30,234 --> 00:36:31,703
All right.

443
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:34,788
All right, I'll do that.

444
00:36:36,572 --> 00:36:38,747
You can leave now.

445
00:36:38,849 --> 00:36:40,057
Honey...

446
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:42,239
Honey!

447
00:36:42,428 --> 00:36:45,440
<i>What did we do to deserve this?</i>

448
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:48,045
Your father in prison...

449
00:36:48,205 --> 00:36:51,508
What now... Honey!

450
00:36:51,683 --> 00:36:54,075
Take her home.

451
00:36:55,037 --> 00:36:57,350
All right.

452
00:37:42,997 --> 00:37:48,628
<i>{\a6}- Yoon Seunghee's Like a Swallow -</i>

453
00:37:42,997 --> 00:37:48,628
When the spring comes,
he said he would come back by my side.

454
00:37:48,788 --> 00:37:55,525
Like a singing swallow.

455
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:02,402
How can you try to sneak in
and touch my hands?

456
00:38:03,508 --> 00:38:04,701
Can't even hold your hands?

457
00:38:04,788 --> 00:38:06,825
That's right.

458
00:38:08,062 --> 00:38:10,987
Why do you keep acting so precious?

459
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:15,516
How nasty...

460
00:38:18,358 --> 00:38:20,943
You were the first to
hold my hands, remember?

461
00:38:22,068 --> 00:38:24,872
She barges in and just
grabs your hands, and then...

462
00:38:25,032 --> 00:38:29,080
I only did that to
console you, that's all.

463
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:32,584
I need your consolation today.

464
00:38:32,897 --> 00:38:33,894
Uh?

465
00:38:33,991 --> 00:38:36,255
So just give me your hand.

466
00:38:37,699 --> 00:38:40,577
Hold my hand and comfort me, will you?

467
00:38:40,766 --> 00:38:41,915
Liar...

468
00:38:42,105 --> 00:38:44,322
Hey... Do I really
need to spell it out?

469
00:38:44,497 --> 00:38:47,160
I really had a terrible day.

470
00:38:47,363 --> 00:38:51,263
Is there anything wrong, really?

471
00:38:51,437 --> 00:38:54,639
Hey... Forget it, then!
Forget I ever mentioned it!

472
00:38:56,381 --> 00:38:58,436
Even holding hands can be this hard...

473
00:38:58,596 --> 00:39:03,767
So something bad happened to you?

474
00:39:42,174 --> 00:39:46,925
Can't you tell me what's wrong?

475
00:39:49,789 --> 00:39:52,568
I'll lie down a moment.

476
00:40:03,942 --> 00:40:08,548
What's with the sigh?
As if the sky was about to fall.

477
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:12,985
I've just had it, that's all.

478
00:40:14,208 --> 00:40:17,569
I just wanted to shake off everything,

479
00:40:18,315 --> 00:40:22,061
and go somewhere quiet, that's all.

480
00:40:35,585 --> 00:40:40,297
I'll cover your ears,
so just close your eyes.

481
00:40:40,471 --> 00:40:44,851
Then, you'll suddenly feel at peace.

482
00:41:25,132 --> 00:41:28,060
So what did you want to see me for?

483
00:41:28,322 --> 00:41:34,215
I hear Manbo Construction's highway
project went to Gwangmyeong Construction?!

484
00:41:34,413 --> 00:41:36,231
I'm well aware.

485
00:41:36,754 --> 00:41:41,287
You said you would join forces
with corporations, right?

486
00:41:41,549 --> 00:41:43,890
- Then, by any chance...
- Yes.

487
00:41:44,123 --> 00:41:46,218
It's Gwangmyeong Construction.

488
00:41:47,481 --> 00:41:49,070
So it was you.

489
00:41:49,259 --> 00:41:53,784
The one responsible for convincing Chairman
Cheon to oust Manbo Construction...

490
00:41:53,988 --> 00:41:57,204
Didn't I tell you I would
defeat Manbo Construction?

491
00:41:57,364 --> 00:42:01,457
Manbo Construction is not going to collapse
just because of a highway project.

492
00:42:01,588 --> 00:42:04,702
I'm well aware that
this is only the beginning.

493
00:42:04,921 --> 00:42:09,795
By any chance,
have we ever met before?

494
00:42:12,509 --> 00:42:15,673
It's just that you look familiar...

495
00:42:15,978 --> 00:42:18,365
Do you know me, by any chance?

496
00:42:18,758 --> 00:42:20,562
Sorry to disappoint you.

497
00:42:20,911 --> 00:42:26,222
Before you met him, what did you do?

498
00:42:29,963 --> 00:42:33,873
Now that I think about it,
we know far too little about you.

499
00:42:34,179 --> 00:42:37,991
Isn't what I'll do from now on
what really matters?

500
00:42:38,195 --> 00:42:39,606
Still, he invested in your company...

501
00:42:39,708 --> 00:42:44,961
Private lenders like us only need
to know the strict necessary.

502
00:42:45,252 --> 00:42:47,638
You may leave.

503
00:42:48,464 --> 00:42:49,773
Yes.

504
00:42:50,087 --> 00:42:52,553
I'll visit you again soon.

505
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:04,690
So he joins forces
with Chairman Cheon,

506
00:43:04,879 --> 00:43:07,906
and scores one against
Manbo Construction?!

507
00:43:11,835 --> 00:43:16,694
That fella is defying
all my expectations.

508
00:43:30,295 --> 00:43:32,492
Thank you.

509
00:43:32,958 --> 00:43:38,726
This next song always brings up
really precious memories.

510
00:43:46,394 --> 00:43:58,644
<i>{\a6}- Baek Seolhee's Spring is Coming to an End -</i>

511
00:43:46,394 --> 00:43:58,644
As the spring breeze
caressed my pink skirt,

512
00:44:00,321 --> 00:44:12,550
Heat dwelling on my coat strings,
the air swarming with swallows.

513
00:44:13,321 --> 00:44:20,334
Back when flowers bloomed by the
sacred tree, as we together smiled,

514
00:44:20,581 --> 00:44:33,686
Or when we together cried by those
withered roses, pledging to each other.

515
00:44:34,273 --> 00:44:40,961
Spring is coming to an end.

516
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:48,774
Wow... Gyeongok, when it comes
to singing, you really are great.

517
00:44:48,891 --> 00:44:50,351
You're the best!

518
00:44:50,447 --> 00:44:51,131
Really?

519
00:44:51,218 --> 00:44:54,230
You know what? Working at the
construction site might kill me,

520
00:44:54,332 --> 00:44:57,402
but I live for this.
This is it.

521
00:44:58,662 --> 00:45:00,423
Then...

522
00:45:00,884 --> 00:45:02,911
Shall we live together?

523
00:45:06,141 --> 00:45:07,000
What?

524
00:45:07,102 --> 00:45:10,215
Why don't you ever mention marriage?

525
00:45:11,103 --> 00:45:14,927
You're not already married, are you?

526
00:45:15,102 --> 00:45:17,692
What are you saying?

527
00:45:17,903 --> 00:45:20,340
Of... course not...

528
00:45:20,704 --> 00:45:26,015
I can barely take care
of myself, you silly.

529
00:45:27,697 --> 00:45:31,224
I don't need anything else,

530
00:45:31,341 --> 00:45:33,916
just for you to love me.

531
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:38,558
To only have eyes for me,
and only treat me with kindness.

532
00:45:38,718 --> 00:45:40,988
To only think about me.

533
00:45:41,483 --> 00:45:43,272
You can do that for me, right?

534
00:45:43,418 --> 00:45:47,354
Are your standards really that low?

535
00:45:47,461 --> 00:45:51,465
With all the fine men you
could find out there, why me?

536
00:45:51,654 --> 00:45:56,267
You'll only end up struggling
if you live with me.

537
00:45:59,929 --> 00:46:05,076
I've long gotten used to struggling.

538
00:46:07,753 --> 00:46:11,420
<i>{\a6}*archaic for partner, husband</i>

539
00:46:07,753 --> 00:46:11,420
Let me pour you a drink, Seobangnim*.

540
00:46:21,901 --> 00:46:35,321
Fresh weeds carried away by the current.

541
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:48,659
I sent another letter again,
leaving along with that last train's hopes.

542
00:46:48,797 --> 00:46:55,646
Back when we together
laughed under the starry sky,

543
00:46:55,774 --> 00:47:02,773
<i>and we shared tears
under those falling stars.</i>

544
00:47:02,933 --> 00:47:09,897
<i>Carried away by such hollow memories,</i>

545
00:47:10,057 --> 00:47:16,969
Spring is coming to an end.

546
00:47:21,474 --> 00:47:24,040
What are you going to accomplish by
going to the Royal Club at this hour?

547
00:47:24,142 --> 00:47:25,490
What do you think?

548
00:47:25,635 --> 00:47:29,244
It was that wench who owns the place who
convinced everyone to push for Jeongyeon.

549
00:47:29,418 --> 00:47:30,335
Am I supposed to
just take it lying down?

550
00:47:30,437 --> 00:47:34,715
Mom, after we lost the highway project
and Minwoo's father went to prison,

551
00:47:34,846 --> 00:47:39,248
- is this the time to be...
- What does that have to do with anything?

552
00:47:39,361 --> 00:47:41,162
Aren't you even angry that they took
away your heir status under your nose?

553
00:47:41,249 --> 00:47:43,054
Of course I am!

554
00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:45,367
I'm sure there's
something fishy going on.

555
00:47:45,556 --> 00:47:50,213
Or else, how would someone running a
business have the time to scheme that?

556
00:47:50,344 --> 00:47:52,479
Whatever.
You go there by yourself.

557
00:47:52,596 --> 00:47:54,822
I'll be waiting outside.

558
00:48:13,836 --> 00:48:18,911
Back in the day,
when I had nothing to my name,

559
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:23,116
all I needed to endure days like this
was thinking about success.

560
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:26,468
But now that I've made it,

561
00:48:26,992 --> 00:48:30,906
these headaches never seem to go away.

562
00:48:31,284 --> 00:48:36,668
I've heard Gwangmyeong Construction
took over the highway project.

563
00:48:36,901 --> 00:48:41,125
It's only going to spoil the mood,
so let's not go there.

564
00:48:41,391 --> 00:48:44,652
Do you know who's behind that?

565
00:48:44,841 --> 00:48:47,038
It was Han Myeongseok.

566
00:48:47,302 --> 00:48:48,857
He betrayed me.

567
00:48:49,002 --> 00:48:51,068
It wasn't Commissioner Han.

568
00:48:51,185 --> 00:48:54,051
What's that supposed to mean?

569
00:48:54,448 --> 00:48:57,867
Someone else plotted all this.

570
00:48:59,566 --> 00:49:01,239
And who is that?

571
00:49:01,487 --> 00:49:05,575
It's Hangang Construction's
president, a certain James Lee.

572
00:49:05,706 --> 00:49:09,242
J...James?!

573
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:14,775
Then, are you telling me
he and Chairman Cheon were in cahoots?

574
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:20,231
How can I help you?

575
00:49:20,466 --> 00:49:21,876
Where's your boss?

576
00:49:22,007 --> 00:49:24,713
If you don't have an appointment,
you can't meet her.

577
00:49:24,902 --> 00:49:26,649
Say what?

578
00:49:26,852 --> 00:49:30,593
What's so great about a damned club,
to need appointments?

579
00:49:30,714 --> 00:49:33,134
Ma'am...

580
00:49:33,817 --> 00:49:36,820
And what are you doing here?

581
00:49:37,999 --> 00:49:41,549
Are you here with the chairman?

582
00:49:42,670 --> 00:49:46,355
I'm sure Commissioner Han
fell into their trap as well.

583
00:49:46,602 --> 00:49:48,508
How could this happen...

584
00:49:49,091 --> 00:49:53,325
That James... What kind of man
could we possibly be dealing with?

585
00:49:54,096 --> 00:49:56,046
He did look familiar,

586
00:49:56,162 --> 00:49:59,189
but I really can't
figure out who he is.

587
00:50:01,605 --> 00:50:03,947
Thanks, Gyeongok.

588
00:50:04,747 --> 00:50:06,508
<i>If it weren't for you,</i>

589
00:50:06,683 --> 00:50:11,572
I would almost have let them
fool me without knowing a thing.

590
00:50:16,690 --> 00:50:19,424
What are you doing here?

591
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:28,431
What do I see...

592
00:50:28,663 --> 00:50:30,759
Was it just this?

593
00:50:31,108 --> 00:50:36,035
So you two fell for each other,
pushed out my Jeongshik...

594
00:50:36,166 --> 00:50:38,218
I can't believe it.

595
00:50:38,334 --> 00:50:41,322
- What the hell are you talking about?
- And you!

596
00:50:41,619 --> 00:50:43,718
Don't even say a word.

597
00:50:45,271 --> 00:50:46,570
<i>Tell me.</i>

598
00:50:46,744 --> 00:50:49,465
How long has this affair
between you two been going on?

599
00:50:50,062 --> 00:50:53,757
I can forgive all the rest,
but you better take that back.

600
00:50:53,903 --> 00:50:55,052
Say what?

601
00:50:55,198 --> 00:50:58,122
We're not what you think...

602
00:51:00,501 --> 00:51:03,070
What? "We"?!

603
00:51:03,390 --> 00:51:05,412
When did it start becoming "we"?

604
00:51:05,732 --> 00:51:08,639
Was it all so that, after taking away
Jeongshik's status, it'd be my turn,

605
00:51:08,756 --> 00:51:11,157
and then you'd finally be
able to go live with him?

606
00:51:11,346 --> 00:51:13,339
Just because you made
a few pennies selling drinks,

607
00:51:13,427 --> 00:51:15,304
think you can prance around
acting like a queen?

608
00:51:15,464 --> 00:51:17,865
<i>Even a lowly mistress
should know her place,</i>

609
00:51:18,010 --> 00:51:20,571
how dare you barge in without...

610
00:51:23,585 --> 00:51:27,951
Go act like a vulgar tramp at home,
how dare you treat me like this?

611
00:51:29,005 --> 00:51:29,784
What?

612
00:51:29,915 --> 00:51:34,004
Do I look like the kind of woman
who deserves your contempt?

613
00:51:34,251 --> 00:51:35,677
You've barked up the wrong tree,

614
00:51:35,837 --> 00:51:39,356
so unless you want to be really
embarrassed, get the hell out of my sight!

615
00:51:44,187 --> 00:51:47,548
That... That wench!

616
00:51:47,795 --> 00:51:50,967
What do you think you're doing?

617
00:51:52,219 --> 00:51:54,037
You tell me.

618
00:51:54,474 --> 00:51:57,379
What were you scheming with her?

619
00:51:57,641 --> 00:51:59,256
Hurry up and tell me!

620
00:51:59,387 --> 00:52:01,090
Ahh... Really...

621
00:52:01,294 --> 00:52:03,446
You woman...

622
00:52:05,528 --> 00:52:10,213
I won't let you two get away with this.

623
00:52:10,722 --> 00:52:15,618
This Oh Namsuk
is not to be taken lightly.

624
00:52:17,583 --> 00:52:20,958
<i>- Cheers!
- Cheers...</i>

625
00:52:27,961 --> 00:52:30,307
Aww... That's refreshing.

626
00:52:33,807 --> 00:52:35,706
- Hey!
- Wait... Wait.

627
00:52:35,793 --> 00:52:39,780
You... Nah...
Let's just put this away.

628
00:52:39,896 --> 00:52:41,337
Look at you.

629
00:52:41,468 --> 00:52:44,274
Do you know how much
you've had already?

630
00:52:45,214 --> 00:52:46,560
So, what?

631
00:52:46,648 --> 00:52:49,924
Since you're with me,
I'm drinking a little bit.

632
00:52:50,045 --> 00:52:51,653
So that's how it tastes like...

633
00:52:51,769 --> 00:52:54,359
Hey!

634
00:52:54,549 --> 00:52:56,920
Forget that,
and have something to eat.

635
00:52:56,993 --> 00:52:59,234
Here you go.

636
00:52:59,292 --> 00:53:01,242
Big Oppa!

637
00:53:02,138 --> 00:53:03,701
Little Oppa!

638
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:06,320
Yeah, Miju. Tell me.

639
00:53:07,985 --> 00:53:13,508
Seeing you two makes me so happy...

640
00:53:13,624 --> 00:53:16,944
I feel like I'm dreaming.

641
00:53:25,747 --> 00:53:30,054
Looks like she's happy you came.

642
00:53:33,412 --> 00:53:38,119
Every time I think of her,
I feel sorry.

643
00:53:39,108 --> 00:53:40,840
Have a drink.

644
00:53:41,687 --> 00:53:43,168
Good job.

645
00:53:43,677 --> 00:53:50,543
I never imagined you'd take the highway
project away from them so quickly.

646
00:53:51,151 --> 00:53:53,155
It's just the first step.

647
00:53:53,431 --> 00:53:55,163
I should say the same about you.

648
00:53:55,323 --> 00:53:57,913
Sending Jo Pilyeon to prison...

649
00:53:59,033 --> 00:54:04,359
It will be hard for him to
get back on his feet this time.

650
00:54:06,098 --> 00:54:10,892
I think I might now be
able to help you for real,

651
00:54:11,096 --> 00:54:13,497
what are your plans from now on?

652
00:54:14,486 --> 00:54:19,783
Chairman Hwang will likely point
his blade at Chairman Cheon.

653
00:54:20,932 --> 00:54:24,182
I'll have to take a step forward
and enter the fight firsthand.

654
00:54:25,219 --> 00:54:28,722
Chief...

655
00:54:32,199 --> 00:54:34,877
She even talks in her sleep?!

656
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:37,787
<i>"Chief..."</i>

657
00:54:47,095 --> 00:54:50,675
Chairman, I'm afraid
I'll have to take this?

658
00:54:50,908 --> 00:54:53,541
Ahh... I lost again!

659
00:54:53,716 --> 00:54:57,816
See? Told you I'm not
cut out for mahjong.

660
00:54:57,903 --> 00:55:00,566
Seems like today
is not your day, Chairman.

661
00:55:00,697 --> 00:55:03,403
Did I ever witness a
good one at the table?

662
00:55:03,505 --> 00:55:05,804
Luck only graces those
good enough for it.

663
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:08,743
Still, you've gotten much better.

664
00:55:08,874 --> 00:55:10,693
- Is that so?
- That's right.

665
00:55:10,882 --> 00:55:15,115
So how much do I have to fork out
before I start improving?

666
00:55:18,413 --> 00:55:22,871
We've had our fun playing,

667
00:55:23,114 --> 00:55:26,640
so shall we get to the point now?

668
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:29,944
But, Chairman Hwang.

669
00:55:30,133 --> 00:55:33,363
Why didn't Chairman Cheon show up?

670
00:55:33,494 --> 00:55:39,907
Maybe he didn't know we came here
instead of the Royal Club?

671
00:55:40,085 --> 00:55:43,740
I didn't invite him on purpose.

672
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:45,835
You didn't invite him?!

673
00:55:45,966 --> 00:55:50,099
Is it because of the
highway project thing?

674
00:55:50,244 --> 00:55:52,601
That's Commissioner
Han Myeongseok's doing...

675
00:55:52,703 --> 00:55:55,424
I'm afraid you're mistaken.

676
00:55:55,933 --> 00:56:00,631
Chairman Cheon conspired with that man
running Hangang Construction...

677
00:56:00,762 --> 00:56:04,457
to take the highway project away from us.

678
00:56:04,705 --> 00:56:07,717
They planned this
from the very beginning.

679
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:10,831
That's not possible...

680
00:56:12,170 --> 00:56:15,967
Chairman Cheon broke committee rules.

681
00:56:16,229 --> 00:56:20,172
As the chairman of this committee,

682
00:56:20,551 --> 00:56:25,658
I'd like to motion for
his permanent exclusion.

683
00:56:27,797 --> 00:56:32,960
Does anyone here oppose my wishes?

684
00:56:42,350 --> 00:56:44,121
Hello?

685
00:56:44,368 --> 00:56:46,230
That's right.

686
00:56:46,463 --> 00:56:49,490
Yes, just a moment.

687
00:56:49,752 --> 00:56:53,244
It's a call for Chairman Baek.

688
00:56:53,550 --> 00:56:54,758
For me?!

689
00:56:54,889 --> 00:56:56,518
Yes.

690
00:56:56,838 --> 00:57:00,360
And who would call me here...

691
00:57:04,697 --> 00:57:06,382
It's me, Chairman Baek.

692
00:57:06,614 --> 00:57:11,387
<i>Do you know who killed
Chairman Hong Gipyo?</i>

693
00:57:12,988 --> 00:57:15,083
What are you saying?

694
00:57:15,243 --> 00:57:19,404
<i>It was Chairman Hwang
Taeseop's son, Hwang Jeongshik.</i>

695
00:57:20,030 --> 00:57:24,621
<i>And of course Chairman Hwang
covered up the truth.</i>

696
00:57:27,874 --> 00:57:29,001
Listen.

697
00:57:29,292 --> 00:57:31,009
Who are you?

698
00:57:31,169 --> 00:57:34,778
<i>Cheon Suman here.</i>

699
00:57:35,185 --> 00:57:37,541
What this fella said is right.

700
00:57:37,818 --> 00:57:41,572
I can swear on my own ancestors.

701
00:57:45,686 --> 00:57:48,192
If you'd like to know more,
please come out.

702
00:57:48,425 --> 00:57:50,797
Of course, you must not tell
anything to Chairman Hwang.

703
00:57:50,913 --> 00:57:55,399
Yes.
I understand.

704
00:57:56,083 --> 00:57:57,567
Chairman Jo?

705
00:57:57,815 --> 00:57:59,473
Come pick up the phone.

706
00:57:59,677 --> 00:58:02,238
- Me?!
- Yes.

707
00:58:07,229 --> 00:58:10,971
Yes, Chairman Jo speaking.

708
00:58:20,938 --> 00:58:25,187
When are you going to show up?

709
00:58:35,342 --> 00:58:39,492
What call could it possibly have been,
to suddenly ask for your attention?

710
00:58:39,623 --> 00:58:41,468
It's nothing.

711
00:58:41,657 --> 00:58:44,596
It was from the golf club,
and... Right!

712
00:58:44,727 --> 00:58:47,855
Chairman Hwang
doesn't like golf, isn't it?

713
00:58:47,957 --> 00:58:53,894
Anyhow, let's wrap up
Chairman Cheon's expulsion here.

714
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:56,891
But we still are a committee,

715
00:58:57,081 --> 00:59:02,328
so shouldn't we first invite the interested
party and announce our decision to him?

716
00:59:02,503 --> 00:59:04,576
If that is your wish,

717
00:59:04,747 --> 00:59:10,040
let's gather again
tonight at the Royal Club.

718
00:59:10,622 --> 00:59:18,884
Anyhow, I'll consider this a unanimous
vote in favor of his exclusion.

719
00:59:21,474 --> 00:59:28,444
Are we really supposed to believe that?

720
00:59:29,061 --> 00:59:31,956
I'll speed up a little,
if you don't mind.

721
00:59:32,102 --> 00:59:34,837
Ahh... Yes, go ahead.

722
00:59:36,874 --> 00:59:40,701
What's that supposed to mean?

723
00:59:40,876 --> 00:59:45,033
Let's be honest, don't you remember
how much better things were...

724
00:59:45,222 --> 00:59:47,478
when Chairman Hong was
presiding over the committee?

725
00:59:47,798 --> 00:59:52,643
But it was Hwang Taeseop's
son who killed him.

726
00:59:52,934 --> 00:59:55,335
And how can you prove that?

727
00:59:55,568 --> 01:00:00,784
There is someone here who can prove it.

728
01:00:24,903 --> 01:00:28,002
They're all waiting inside.

729
01:00:51,443 --> 01:00:53,025
The order of the day...

730
01:00:53,258 --> 01:01:00,312
concerns the expulsion of Chairman
Cheon of Gwangmyeong Construction.

731
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:04,113
Aren't you being excessive?

732
01:01:04,491 --> 01:01:09,391
- I merely did what Commissioner Han...
- We'll decide via secret voting.

733
01:01:10,379 --> 01:01:19,212
I'm sure you know you must
abide by our decision, Chairman?

734
01:01:21,906 --> 01:01:26,195
Here... Let's begin.

735
01:01:57,620 --> 01:02:03,630
I will now announce the results of the
voting on Chairman Cheon's expulsion.

736
01:02:11,497 --> 01:02:13,532
One vote against.

737
01:02:20,007 --> 01:02:21,967
For.

738
01:02:28,409 --> 01:02:30,617
Against.

739
01:02:33,061 --> 01:02:34,808
Against.

740
01:02:43,744 --> 01:02:45,627
Against.

741
01:02:52,041 --> 01:02:57,148
And with that, the motion to expel
Chairman Cheon from the committee...

742
01:02:57,483 --> 01:02:59,986
has been rejected.

743
01:03:01,327 --> 01:03:03,364
Dammit!

744
01:03:05,677 --> 01:03:10,261
How do you explain this?

745
01:03:11,498 --> 01:03:13,753
Are you deaf?

746
01:03:14,088 --> 01:03:17,419
Let's hear it!

747
01:03:21,085 --> 01:03:23,923
Since we're all gathered here tonight,

748
01:03:24,316 --> 01:03:27,968
I'll take this opportunity
to introduce a new member.

749
01:03:28,629 --> 01:03:33,947
And what is that supposed to mean?
A new member?!

750
01:03:34,273 --> 01:03:36,436
Come on in.

751
01:04:04,611 --> 01:04:06,461
Sir,

752
01:04:07,363 --> 01:04:09,851
how have you been?

753
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:13,867
You...

754
01:04:17,067 --> 01:04:18,611
You!

755
01:04:19,149 --> 01:04:21,666
I'm president of Hangang Construction,

756
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:24,591
Lee Gangmo.

757
01:04:28,054 --> 01:04:30,033
Gangmo...

758
01:04:31,799 --> 01:04:33,772
Gangmo?!

Why are you trying to
strangle Manbo Construction?

765
01:04:54,876 --> 01:04:58,295
And how about paying the price
for taking my father's life?

766
01:04:58,412 --> 01:05:00,987
<i>Why don't you go wear a pair of pants?</i>

767
01:05:01,104 --> 01:05:03,766
<i>Why should I wear pants
at home, when it's so hot?</i>

768
01:05:03,926 --> 01:05:06,662
Seems like Jo Pilyeon
might be released earlier.

769
01:05:06,793 --> 01:05:08,614
You better be on your toes.

770
01:05:08,701 --> 01:05:12,222
<i>He's not the kind of man
who'll forgive and forget.</i>

771
01:05:12,324 --> 01:05:15,874
So you want to create a rift between
Jo Pilyeon and Hwang Taeseop?

772
01:05:16,005 --> 01:05:18,406
<i>If Hwang Taeseop is involved,
all the better.</i>

773
01:05:18,479 --> 01:05:20,894
Jo Pilyeon knows I'm alive.

774
01:05:21,025 --> 01:05:22,189
Then, what now?

775
01:05:22,277 --> 01:05:24,096
<i>I'll have to meet him.</i>

776
