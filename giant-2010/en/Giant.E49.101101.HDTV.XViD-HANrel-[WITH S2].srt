Episode 49

5
00:00:18,872 --> 00:00:22,602
Hey... Aren't you guys hungry?

6
00:00:23,147 --> 00:00:25,848
Should we order some chicken?

7
00:00:27,416 --> 00:00:29,419
I'm fine.

8
00:00:29,516 --> 00:00:32,146
I'll give you the
money, so go get some.

9
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:34,854
Where did I put my wallet...

10
00:01:08,303 --> 00:01:10,174
What's going on?

11
00:01:11,515 --> 00:01:12,921
Seonbaenim!

12
00:01:13,075 --> 00:01:15,105
Open the door!

13
00:01:16,914 --> 00:01:18,869
Open the door, Chief Lee!

14
00:01:19,009 --> 00:01:21,001
Open it!

15
00:01:21,109 --> 00:01:22,549
Chief!

16
00:01:25,683 --> 00:01:27,586
Hands up.

17
00:01:28,178 --> 00:01:30,539
Call the director right away.

18
00:01:30,735 --> 00:01:32,246
Do it!

19
00:01:36,106 --> 00:01:37,149
What?

20
00:01:37,242 --> 00:01:39,283
Seongmo is holding them hostage?

21
00:01:39,381 --> 00:01:41,648
He's in a standoff with
the agents as we speak.

22
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,090
What is he asking?

23
00:01:43,202 --> 00:01:45,744
To talk with the ANSP director.

24
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:48,380
So? Did they report this to Director Kim?

25
00:01:48,534 --> 00:01:51,127
He is currently at the Blue House.

26
00:01:51,238 --> 00:01:53,085
If people learn of this,
it'll only create more headaches.

27
00:01:53,169 --> 00:01:54,330
Follow me!

28
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:55,795
All right.

29
00:01:59,551 --> 00:02:01,515
Where is he being confined?

30
00:02:01,664 --> 00:02:02,937
A villa in Yeonhee-Dong.

31
00:02:03,035 --> 00:02:05,134
Give me the address and phone number.

32
00:02:05,249 --> 00:02:06,492
It's not going to help anyway.

33
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,941
All the phones there are already bugged.

34
00:02:09,053 --> 00:02:13,138
He doesn't know
what's happening outside.

35
00:02:13,249 --> 00:02:16,721
I'm just worried Jo Pilyeon
will get his hands on that account.

36
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:20,271
Still, we have no way of alerting him!

37
00:02:20,381 --> 00:02:22,814
We have no time, do it!

38
00:02:50,409 --> 00:02:51,361
Yes.

39
00:02:51,487 --> 00:02:53,807
What's wrong with you?

40
00:02:56,094 --> 00:02:58,133
I need to see the director.

41
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,292
I told you I'd solve everything!

42
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,475
Didn't I tell you to wait just a few days?

43
00:03:02,559 --> 00:03:05,887
How much longer do you want
me to just endure all this like a retard?

44
00:03:05,992 --> 00:03:07,584
Hey... Lee Seongmo!

45
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:11,049
You didn't even let me take all the blame.

46
00:03:11,623 --> 00:03:14,415
If I have to keep enduring
being treated like a criminal,

47
00:03:14,525 --> 00:03:18,984
I'd rather prove my innocence instead.

48
00:03:19,306 --> 00:03:20,566
I know what you're feeling, Seongmo.

49
00:03:20,622 --> 00:03:22,609
I understand perfectly.

50
00:03:23,659 --> 00:03:26,787
If you do, then let me do as I wish!

51
00:03:27,011 --> 00:03:29,852
I'm coming your way right now.

52
00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:33,108
We're almost there.

53
00:03:33,234 --> 00:03:36,588
Until I arrive,
don't do anything foolish.

54
00:03:36,697 --> 00:03:38,711
Understand, Seongmo?

55
00:03:39,872 --> 00:03:41,799
Why aren't you answering me?

56
00:03:41,907 --> 00:03:44,215
Do you understand, Seongmo?

57
00:03:45,405 --> 00:03:47,742
I'll be waiting.

58
00:03:58,526 --> 00:03:59,997
Fine...

59
00:04:00,643 --> 00:04:07,303
Ending it all right here might beat
waiting for that account to be revealed.

60
00:04:08,604 --> 00:04:11,879
We're going down together, Jo Pilyeon.

61
00:04:24,846 --> 00:04:26,400
There's no way in.

62
00:04:26,512 --> 00:04:28,442
The place is swarming with ANSP agents.

63
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,122
What do we do now?

64
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:35,355
Because of the bugs, calling would
likely get him into even more trouble.

65
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:49,164
Gangmo...

66
00:04:49,271 --> 00:04:51,006
Jo Pilyeon is here!

67
00:04:51,203 --> 00:04:54,982
Can he really stop your brother?

68
00:04:57,115 --> 00:04:58,332
He'll kill him.

69
00:04:58,584 --> 00:04:59,340
Uh?!

70
00:04:59,452 --> 00:05:04,113
Seongmo... could kill Jo Pilyeon!

71
00:05:04,183 --> 00:05:06,842
Then... what?

72
00:05:06,954 --> 00:05:10,117
That would kill him as well.

73
00:05:28,334 --> 00:05:29,555
Here you are.

74
00:05:29,657 --> 00:05:33,031
Lee Seongmo is refusing to listen.

75
00:05:33,158 --> 00:05:34,245
Tell him I'm going in.

76
00:05:34,357 --> 00:05:37,427
Congressman.
Seongmo is armed.

77
00:05:37,556 --> 00:05:39,642
Not to mention quite agitated.

78
00:05:39,767 --> 00:05:41,427
If you really want to try
and convince him, do it from here.

79
00:05:41,511 --> 00:05:45,511
Nah... I'll go in and talk to him firsthand.

80
00:06:02,248 --> 00:06:03,245
Seongmo.

81
00:06:03,358 --> 00:06:04,570
It's me.

82
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:06,909
Can I come in?

83
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:12,717
First, it'd be wise to let
those two agents go.

84
00:06:25,538 --> 00:06:28,841
You're the one who talked about
meeting on top of 31 Building, right?

85
00:06:32,003 --> 00:06:35,332
We found your siblings.

86
00:06:35,693 --> 00:06:39,264
All you have to do is
wait until the end of the month.

87
00:06:40,986 --> 00:06:43,113
Park Seungcheol.

88
00:06:44,261 --> 00:06:46,220
Are you listening to me?

89
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,632
You called the wrong number.

90
00:06:51,062 --> 00:06:53,922
Did he get it?

91
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,050
He did.

92
00:06:58,141 --> 00:07:00,884
I'm sure he understood.

93
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:14,983
Seongmo!

94
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:18,146
- Close the door.
- Ohh... Right.

95
00:07:23,254 --> 00:07:24,416
Seongmo.

96
00:07:24,584 --> 00:07:26,515
Give me that g...

97
00:07:26,837 --> 00:07:28,410
Hey... Lee Seongmo!

98
00:07:32,855 --> 00:07:35,346
No matter how dirty or dangerous it was,

99
00:07:35,523 --> 00:07:39,974
I never refused to do anything before,
if it was for your sake.

100
00:07:40,926 --> 00:07:43,375
So why...

101
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:46,748
are you suspecting me?

102
00:07:47,687 --> 00:07:49,309
S... Seongmo...

103
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:51,072
I think you're misunderstanding something.

104
00:07:51,184 --> 00:07:52,975
Shut up!

105
00:07:55,215 --> 00:07:58,196
You're not going to fool me any longer.

106
00:07:58,906 --> 00:08:00,393
You saw that right.

107
00:08:00,876 --> 00:08:02,912
I'm suspecting you indeed.

108
00:08:03,211 --> 00:08:04,732
Congressman!

109
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:11,342
But suspecting someone
with the intent of killing him...

110
00:08:11,446 --> 00:08:15,493
and doing it to save him
are two very different things.

111
00:08:15,716 --> 00:08:17,625
Do you know what I mean?

112
00:08:17,844 --> 00:08:22,805
If only to prove your innocence
to everyone, I must suspect you.

113
00:08:22,914 --> 00:08:26,939
Only then will people
stop trying to accuse you.

114
00:08:29,202 --> 00:08:30,936
Look, Seongmo.

115
00:08:31,044 --> 00:08:35,004
The world I always wanted
is right around the corner.

116
00:08:35,178 --> 00:08:40,341
And if only to make sure
we all get there together,

117
00:08:40,733 --> 00:08:45,597
I must suspect you until
we find the real culprit.

118
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:56,182
But if you are the culprit, then this
is your best chance to pull that trigger.

119
00:08:56,424 --> 00:09:01,416
If that's not the
case, give me that gun.

120
00:09:04,509 --> 00:09:06,104
Do it.

121
00:09:27,926 --> 00:09:29,701
Congressman!

122
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:35,708
Seongmo.

123
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:38,017
What people call suspicion...

124
00:09:38,157 --> 00:09:40,200
has no gray areas.

125
00:09:40,889 --> 00:09:43,873
You either let go of it once and for all,

126
00:09:44,424 --> 00:09:47,176
or keep suspecting to the very end.

127
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:53,535
They way I see it,
you're still suspicious of me.

128
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:58,488
Giving up the gun wasn't what
a pro would do, don't you think?

129
00:10:00,531 --> 00:10:05,401
So are you going to use it to shoot me?

130
00:10:06,129 --> 00:10:10,034
Because you and I are different.

131
00:10:38,043 --> 00:10:40,044
You saw wrong.

132
00:10:40,856 --> 00:10:47,025
From the very start, I had
no intention of shooting you.

133
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:53,508
If I was still suspecting you, I
would have neither removed the bullets,

134
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:57,427
not let you take that gun.

135
00:11:06,562 --> 00:11:08,171
That's right, Seongmo!

136
00:11:08,331 --> 00:11:11,155
This is exactly what I wanted.

137
00:11:11,334 --> 00:11:15,403
To either clear any suspicion,
or take it to the very end.

138
00:11:42,403 --> 00:11:44,279
Of all people...

139
00:11:44,524 --> 00:11:48,241
Of all people, why is it Lee Gangmo?
Of all damn people...

140
00:11:58,093 --> 00:12:01,102
Did you find out anything
more about Lee Miju?

141
00:12:01,732 --> 00:12:03,285
Chairman...

142
00:12:03,397 --> 00:12:05,440
I...

143
00:12:05,615 --> 00:12:07,801
Go ahead and tell me.
What is it?

144
00:12:07,892 --> 00:12:11,028
Why were Miju and Lee Gangmo...

145
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:16,440
The apartment Lee Miju lives in...

146
00:12:16,899 --> 00:12:19,479
was bought by President Lee Gangmo.

147
00:12:21,312 --> 00:12:25,637
But there is no evidence proving
they're seeing each other.

148
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:29,135
Even the private investigator
followed them for a few days,

149
00:12:29,295 --> 00:12:34,228
but he says that this was their only meeting.

150
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:39,370
And there is something
else that is a little strange,

151
00:12:39,452 --> 00:12:43,947
the fact that the deputy mayor
helped Miss Lee get a spot on TV.

152
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:47,739
Deputy Han Myeongseok?

153
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:49,804
Yes, Chairman.

154
00:12:51,302 --> 00:12:55,127
Find out where I can meet her tonight.

155
00:12:55,221 --> 00:12:57,138
All right.

156
00:13:03,473 --> 00:13:05,644
Okay, I understand.

157
00:13:07,502 --> 00:13:09,563
I'll call you.

158
00:13:12,256 --> 00:13:15,079
Gangmo just left for the Royal Club.

159
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:18,185
Did he say Seongmo was fine?

160
00:13:18,311 --> 00:13:23,272
You can rest assured. He said
he was able to talk to him.

161
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:27,149
For the time being,
nothing big should happen.

162
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:29,903
That's a relief.

163
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:31,433
I'm so glad to hear that.

164
00:13:31,554 --> 00:13:36,019
If this event goes well,
Gangmo will rescue him.

165
00:13:36,145 --> 00:13:38,245
You can believe that, Miju.

166
00:13:38,557 --> 00:13:40,400
Yes, Eonni.

167
00:13:40,652 --> 00:13:43,717
A car has been following us for a while.

168
00:13:45,928 --> 00:13:47,370
I know.

169
00:13:47,537 --> 00:13:49,889
Just drive as if nothing happened.

170
00:13:50,197 --> 00:13:52,855
Who are those people?

171
00:13:56,872 --> 00:13:59,699
I think they're
heading for the Royal Club.

172
00:14:00,286 --> 00:14:06,220
I did follow Hwang Jeongyeon around
all day, but no traces of her father.

173
00:14:09,135 --> 00:14:10,995
Keep checking on her.

174
00:14:11,257 --> 00:14:15,236
They're father and daughter,
so they'll soon call each other.

175
00:14:16,702 --> 00:14:19,770
Before Lee Seongmo confesses,
we must get our hands on that account.

176
00:14:19,924 --> 00:14:24,548
Or else they'll start
breathing down our neck this time.

177
00:14:29,476 --> 00:14:31,099
Come on in, Jeongyeon.

178
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:32,471
Let me borrow a room.

179
00:14:32,569 --> 00:14:35,340
I need to discuss details
of the event with Soojeong.

180
00:14:35,522 --> 00:14:37,495
Use this one, it's quiet.

181
00:14:37,579 --> 00:14:39,629
Come on in.

182
00:14:44,204 --> 00:14:47,816
Those people have
been following us all day.

183
00:14:50,615 --> 00:14:53,358
Find out who they are.

184
00:14:58,206 --> 00:15:00,011
Let's go in.

185
00:15:05,456 --> 00:15:07,303
Welcome.

186
00:15:08,493 --> 00:15:11,723
I think I've never seen you around...

187
00:15:15,099 --> 00:15:18,275
Right after the opening
act, the party will start.

188
00:15:18,385 --> 00:15:22,300
Soojeong, you will
open the second part of the event.

189
00:15:22,631 --> 00:15:23,896
But, Eonni.

190
00:15:24,062 --> 00:15:29,053
Are you and Gangmo just friends?

191
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:30,677
Uh?!

192
00:15:32,104 --> 00:15:33,602
Yeah...

193
00:15:33,882 --> 00:15:35,785
I was hoping otherwise...

194
00:15:35,911 --> 00:15:38,150
He's no fun, is he?

195
00:15:38,318 --> 00:15:42,461
Nah... He's fun to hang out with,
not to mention really manly.

196
00:15:42,671 --> 00:15:47,135
So he's not just a
childhood friend to you?

197
00:15:49,137 --> 00:15:50,648
That's not what I meant...

198
00:15:50,732 --> 00:15:55,491
I really wish Gangmo could
marry someone like you.

199
00:15:58,033 --> 00:15:59,487
Yes?

200
00:16:01,882 --> 00:16:03,742
Come on in, Deputy.

201
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:05,660
How are you?

202
00:16:06,038 --> 00:16:09,411
Ahh... Miss Cha, you were here as well.

203
00:16:09,537 --> 00:16:11,203
I'll let you talk.

204
00:16:11,315 --> 00:16:14,042
No. I need to go see Director Yoo.

205
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:16,303
Discuss the rest with the deputy.

206
00:16:16,401 --> 00:16:17,806
Yes, Eonni.

207
00:16:18,379 --> 00:16:21,360
- I...
- I'll let you two talk it out.

208
00:16:25,643 --> 00:16:27,413
Have a seat.

209
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,864
Yes.

210
00:16:30,124 --> 00:16:32,145
Let's... have a seat.

211
00:16:34,412 --> 00:16:36,945
Here's the event's program.

212
00:16:41,522 --> 00:16:42,390
But...

213
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:45,164
It's upside down.

214
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:48,919
Ahh... Yes... Of course.

215
00:16:55,898 --> 00:16:57,639
Come on in, Chairman Jo.

216
00:16:57,736 --> 00:17:00,561
Which room is Cha Soojeong in?

217
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:15,703
If you want, you can go.

218
00:17:15,913 --> 00:17:18,250
I won't mind.

219
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:20,761
I should have thanked you the other time.

220
00:17:20,851 --> 00:17:22,582
I really appreciated it.

221
00:17:22,681 --> 00:17:23,537
What?

222
00:17:23,644 --> 00:17:29,338
The director told me of all
the help you've been giving me.

223
00:17:30,329 --> 00:17:32,333
Ahh...

224
00:17:32,769 --> 00:17:34,674
That...

225
00:17:34,984 --> 00:17:40,715
That was just...
I did it as a favor to her.

226
00:17:42,538 --> 00:17:43,500
Are you all right?

227
00:17:43,584 --> 00:17:45,935
Yes... I'm fine...
Everything is fine.

228
00:17:46,005 --> 00:17:48,844
It's all right. Let me do it.

229
00:17:58,654 --> 00:18:01,649
Chairman Jo.
What brings you here?

230
00:18:03,217 --> 00:18:06,112
I was told you
were here, so I came.

231
00:18:09,445 --> 00:18:11,790
Have a seat, then.

232
00:18:11,894 --> 00:18:14,231
I was about to order some drinks.

233
00:18:14,329 --> 00:18:15,953
Sit.

234
00:18:20,014 --> 00:18:22,939
She's a new singer.

235
00:18:23,037 --> 00:18:25,822
I'm sorry, excuse me a moment.

236
00:18:25,962 --> 00:18:28,299
Remain seated, Miss Cha.

237
00:18:29,787 --> 00:18:34,206
So you two knew each other?

238
00:18:34,378 --> 00:18:36,351
I'm a big fan of hers.

239
00:18:36,886 --> 00:18:39,192
And I've been for quite a long time.

240
00:18:42,398 --> 00:18:43,908
Is that so?

241
00:18:44,018 --> 00:18:46,148
I'll let you two talk.

242
00:18:47,619 --> 00:18:50,580
Are you a fan of hers as well, Deputy?

243
00:18:50,846 --> 00:18:52,413
Yes.

244
00:18:52,847 --> 00:18:56,738
Well... I guess you could say that.

245
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:06,405
As you said, Min Honggi
sent men to spy on us.

246
00:19:06,692 --> 00:19:07,993
There is no doubt.

247
00:19:08,161 --> 00:19:09,673
The director checked their identity.

248
00:19:09,841 --> 00:19:11,100
Where are you now?

249
00:19:11,254 --> 00:19:12,396
I'm almost there.

250
00:19:12,534 --> 00:19:14,319
I'll arrive in a minute.

251
00:19:21,517 --> 00:19:23,024
Let go.

252
00:19:24,185 --> 00:19:26,102
Minwoo...

253
00:19:32,134 --> 00:19:33,702
What are you doing?

254
00:19:33,912 --> 00:19:36,655
Before I make a scene,
keep your mouth shut.

255
00:19:36,781 --> 00:19:39,460
I don't know what I
might be capable of right now.

256
00:19:40,467 --> 00:19:41,709
So let's get to the point.

257
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:43,462
I need to leave.

258
00:19:44,218 --> 00:19:46,471
Who else are you going to meet?

259
00:19:47,283 --> 00:19:49,011
Other than Lee Gangmo and Han Myeongseok,

260
00:19:49,124 --> 00:19:50,726
is there anyone else?

261
00:19:51,151 --> 00:19:52,853
What are you talking about?

262
00:19:53,105 --> 00:19:56,223
First it was an apartment from Lee Gangmo,
then broadcast gigs from Han Myeongseok...

263
00:19:56,394 --> 00:19:58,358
What else do you need?

264
00:20:00,355 --> 00:20:02,888
I told you that I would
give you everything you want!

265
00:20:03,014 --> 00:20:05,248
Why ask all those men instead...

266
00:20:06,257 --> 00:20:11,420
Was this your way of
forcing me to dislike you?

267
00:20:12,148 --> 00:20:16,099
Think that by acting this way all
my feelings for you would suddenly vanish?

268
00:20:16,697 --> 00:20:19,546
You're sorely mistaken, Lee Miju.

269
00:20:19,687 --> 00:20:23,693
If that's all you can do, just give up!
Whatever you try,

270
00:20:24,569 --> 00:20:26,227
it'll never make me dislike you.

271
00:20:26,381 --> 00:20:28,304
It's not going to work!

272
00:20:29,557 --> 00:20:31,811
Before I start screaming,

273
00:20:32,145 --> 00:20:34,092
let go of my hand.

274
00:20:34,884 --> 00:20:37,165
Go ahead and scream!

275
00:20:37,498 --> 00:20:40,972
I'm not going to let you act
like this anymore, I'll do as I please!

276
00:20:41,084 --> 00:20:42,469
Stop this, Minwoo.

277
00:20:42,581 --> 00:20:45,114
I told you that it's not what you think!

278
00:20:46,822 --> 00:20:51,412
I know... You're not that kind of woman.
And that drives me even crazier!

279
00:20:51,739 --> 00:20:54,192
Must you really do this to me...

280
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:02,645
Leave, Lee Gangmo...

281
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,839
Leave us alone, Miju.

282
00:21:07,946 --> 00:21:10,147
Stay here, Lee Miju!

283
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:13,453
Let me handle it.

284
00:21:14,695 --> 00:21:16,836
Hey, Lee Miju...

285
00:21:17,564 --> 00:21:19,356
You son of a bitch...

286
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,127
Stop it...

287
00:21:32,226 --> 00:21:34,876
Both of you, just stop!

288
00:21:39,351 --> 00:21:40,202
Please...

289
00:21:40,272 --> 00:21:42,706
Please, let me handle this.

290
00:21:42,812 --> 00:21:44,737
I'm asking you.

291
00:21:52,056 --> 00:21:54,159
What's going on between you two?

292
00:21:54,263 --> 00:21:57,122
What is this all about?

293
00:21:57,647 --> 00:21:59,543
Lee Miju...

294
00:22:01,096 --> 00:22:03,210
is my sister.

295
00:22:06,918 --> 00:22:08,962
What?

296
00:22:11,698 --> 00:22:13,615
Sister?!

297
00:22:14,029 --> 00:22:19,018
The sister I lost in my childhood.

298
00:22:26,287 --> 00:22:31,340
And you know why Miju had to go
through all those hardships at that orphanage?

299
00:22:31,452 --> 00:22:32,736
Oppa...

300
00:22:32,845 --> 00:22:35,076
Because your father Jo Pilyeon...

301
00:22:35,496 --> 00:22:38,127
- killed...
- Don't tell him, Oppa!

302
00:22:38,371 --> 00:22:41,501
If anyone tells him, I will.
That's what I wish for.

303
00:22:41,598 --> 00:22:43,592
Please, Oppa.

304
00:22:43,701 --> 00:22:45,452
I beg you...

305
00:22:49,147 --> 00:22:51,778
I'll be waiting outside.

306
00:22:56,173 --> 00:22:59,247
Don't ever show up before Miju again.

307
00:22:59,373 --> 00:23:01,262
Or else...

308
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:03,613
I might even kill you.

309
00:23:03,697 --> 00:23:04,971
No!

310
00:23:07,602 --> 00:23:09,309
I...

311
00:23:10,127 --> 00:23:12,821
will do that with my own hands.

312
00:23:47,973 --> 00:23:49,950
Is Lee Gangmo...

313
00:23:53,602 --> 00:23:58,319
really the brother you
lost when you were little?

314
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:11,311
What else was he trying to tell me?

315
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:23,802
What on earth did my father do to you?

316
00:24:27,762 --> 00:24:30,072
He killed...

317
00:24:32,441 --> 00:24:34,680
our father.

318
00:24:43,855 --> 00:24:50,107
And that is the reason
why I had to leave you.

319
00:24:55,216 --> 00:24:57,143
Minwoo...

320
00:25:01,569 --> 00:25:03,327
No.

321
00:25:04,125 --> 00:25:05,629
It's not possible.

322
00:25:05,705 --> 00:25:06,714
No...

323
00:25:06,784 --> 00:25:08,379
No, there is no way.

324
00:25:08,463 --> 00:25:11,165
No way...
There is no way!

325
00:25:13,164 --> 00:25:15,083
No!

326
00:25:17,364 --> 00:25:20,238
- Calm down...
- No damn way.

327
00:25:20,336 --> 00:25:22,869
Minwoo... Calm down.

328
00:25:29,475 --> 00:25:36,905
I never regretted loving you.

329
00:25:38,359 --> 00:25:40,110
Miju...

330
00:25:45,051 --> 00:25:47,682
I'm sorry, Minwoo.

331
00:25:48,199 --> 00:25:52,479
It's not your fault...
But this is all I could do.

332
00:26:01,864 --> 00:26:06,706
Just let go of me now.

333
00:26:09,155 --> 00:26:14,319
Stop suffering because of me.

334
00:27:01,075 --> 00:27:04,522
I told you to tell me if
you had any problem, didn't I?

335
00:27:05,354 --> 00:27:08,816
Why did you try to deal with
all that by yourself, you silly?

336
00:27:11,307 --> 00:27:15,436
Minwoo will suffer even more than me.

337
00:27:19,481 --> 00:27:22,294
I know, Oppa.
I know everything.

338
00:27:22,529 --> 00:27:28,244
But he sincerely loved me.

339
00:27:32,764 --> 00:27:38,656
Not telling Minwoo about our father
was my last act of kindness to him.

340
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:45,315
Because his family means to
him just as much as you do to me.

341
00:27:47,429 --> 00:27:51,235
Him and I could never become family,

342
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:58,560
so I didn't want to
take that away from him.

343
00:28:08,473 --> 00:28:11,267
I understand.

344
00:28:13,394 --> 00:28:15,760
That'll do.

345
00:28:16,334 --> 00:28:21,246
Jo Minwoo will never bother you again.

346
00:28:40,701 --> 00:28:44,035
What are you doing here so late?

347
00:28:46,578 --> 00:28:48,451
I missed you.

348
00:28:48,535 --> 00:28:50,802
And Wooju as well.

349
00:28:55,729 --> 00:28:59,799
Right... I'm sending Wooju
to another kindergarten.

350
00:28:59,906 --> 00:29:01,976
They knew you are his mother,

351
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:07,098
so what if they spread rumors
about Cha Soojeong's hidden child?

352
00:29:09,371 --> 00:29:12,848
Go sleep next to Wooju.

353
00:29:12,995 --> 00:29:17,334
He'll love waking up
tomorrow with you by his side.

354
00:30:05,234 --> 00:30:07,599
- My Daddy -

355
00:30:32,222 --> 00:30:34,505
Wooju...

356
00:30:35,531 --> 00:30:37,710
Wooju.

357
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:40,551
Wooju.

358
00:30:41,269 --> 00:30:43,116
Wooju...

359
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:01,757
Not only no calls, but no one tried
to approach Seongmo in person, either.

360
00:31:01,864 --> 00:31:04,233
Still, you can't let your guard down.

361
00:31:04,343 --> 00:31:07,202
Seongmo is not someone you can
keep in check with only a few men.

362
00:31:07,292 --> 00:31:08,682
Don't worry.

363
00:31:08,791 --> 00:31:12,391
I've already told the
agents to pay special attention.

364
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:21,768
Jjajangmyeon is here.

365
00:31:37,234 --> 00:31:38,508
Hey...

366
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:40,656
What are you looking at?

367
00:31:41,909 --> 00:31:46,460
I was told Cha Soojeong lives here?!

368
00:31:48,814 --> 00:31:50,529
Cha Soojeong?

369
00:31:50,896 --> 00:31:53,443
You know who I'm talking about.

370
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:56,438
The one who sings that.

371
00:31:56,564 --> 00:31:58,366
She's not here.

372
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:00,785
Ahh... That's strange?!

373
00:32:00,889 --> 00:32:08,797
The ajumma selling waffles down
the street said she lives here?

374
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:11,470
Enjoy your meal.

375
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,773
I've added two more on the
house, youngster. Come often.

376
00:32:22,871 --> 00:32:26,710
Aigoo... Now that's a handsome fella.

377
00:32:26,801 --> 00:32:30,064
Aigoo, you brat...
Worry about the waffles, will you?

378
00:32:30,162 --> 00:32:33,418
Aigoo, why?
Am I wrong?

379
00:32:33,524 --> 00:32:35,143
- Here you go.
- Yes, thank you.

380
00:32:35,213 --> 00:32:38,166
See you again.

381
00:32:49,215 --> 00:32:50,236
I'm so thankful...

382
00:32:50,334 --> 00:32:52,120
Aigoo, what are you saying?

383
00:32:52,231 --> 00:32:56,478
Today business was so slow...

384
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:58,227
We can't complain either!

385
00:32:58,297 --> 00:33:01,527
But will that really help?

386
00:33:01,622 --> 00:33:03,070
It sure will.

387
00:33:03,199 --> 00:33:05,072
I don't really know what's going on,

388
00:33:05,182 --> 00:33:07,347
but have these.

389
00:33:07,444 --> 00:33:11,202
Looks like I found my new calling.

390
00:33:17,766 --> 00:33:20,124
- Bought them?
- Yes.

391
00:33:20,963 --> 00:33:22,783
Have you given one
each to the boys outside?

392
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:24,378
Yes, Chief.

393
00:33:24,476 --> 00:33:27,615
But you really seem to like waffles?

394
00:33:27,709 --> 00:33:29,361
Don't you know how great they taste?

395
00:33:29,431 --> 00:33:32,272
Have these and get out of my way.

396
00:33:58,039 --> 00:34:02,168
Soon something will make
them stop suspecting you.

397
00:34:02,404 --> 00:34:05,529
Don't worry and just wait, Hyung.

398
00:34:21,907 --> 00:34:25,472
This time I found it by my house's gates.

399
00:34:25,567 --> 00:34:27,689
I got one myself.

400
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:29,822
It's the third one, already.

401
00:34:29,922 --> 00:34:32,256
I'm so nervous I can't take this any longer.

402
00:34:32,354 --> 00:34:35,912
What if this ends up reaching the Blue House?

403
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:38,606
They could even
proclaim martial law for this.

404
00:34:38,856 --> 00:34:42,398
And if that happens,
congress will be dismissed,

405
00:34:43,266 --> 00:34:45,869
making everything
we accomplished so far fruitless.

406
00:34:45,967 --> 00:34:48,871
I never imagined Hwang
Taeseop would be so daring.

407
00:34:48,967 --> 00:34:53,598
Whatever it takes, we must catch him.

408
00:34:58,511 --> 00:35:00,499
By now, Min Honggi and
all the others will be sure...

409
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:05,355
that you're the man
behind all these threats.

410
00:35:05,579 --> 00:35:08,137
I'm sure that's the case.

411
00:35:08,246 --> 00:35:10,700
Since they're even following Jeongyeon.

412
00:35:10,807 --> 00:35:14,207
Those were ANSP agents.

413
00:35:14,298 --> 00:35:17,789
Then, what can we do now?

414
00:35:18,012 --> 00:35:22,757
When you push people into a corner,
all they look for is a way out.

415
00:35:23,689 --> 00:35:28,494
If we want to use
Min Honggi as our bait,

416
00:35:28,802 --> 00:35:31,685
he must be shown a way out.

417
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:39,657
For taking time out of your busy
schedule, I am truly thankful.

418
00:35:39,895 --> 00:35:44,248
Miss Hwang Jeongyeon
will now explain our motive...

419
00:35:44,402 --> 00:35:49,972
for forming this 88 Seoul
Olympics Support Committee.

420
00:36:00,697 --> 00:36:03,776
How are you?
My name is Hwang Jeongyeon.

421
00:36:04,168 --> 00:36:08,098
As you're well aware, the Olympic
Games are not merely a sporting event,

422
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:13,340
but a gathering where varied
cultures and economies come into contact.

423
00:36:13,494 --> 00:36:17,897
So this newly formed committee is
the very first civilian support group...

424
00:36:18,038 --> 00:36:21,024
with the success of our Olympic Games in mind.

425
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:25,334
Our fund-raising event...

426
00:36:28,926 --> 00:36:30,499
- Thank you.
- I enjoyed it.

427
00:36:30,591 --> 00:36:32,341
Thank you.

428
00:36:34,351 --> 00:36:36,752
That was a brilliant briefing.

429
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:39,108
I'm sure the congressmen will participate?

430
00:36:39,201 --> 00:36:41,832
Politicians can't resist beautiful women.

431
00:36:41,972 --> 00:36:45,359
Seeing how speechless they were
in the presence of such a beauty like you,

432
00:36:45,485 --> 00:36:48,536
I can guarantee full participation.

433
00:36:49,194 --> 00:36:52,441
But I didn't see any opposition member
from the legislation committee?

434
00:36:52,553 --> 00:36:55,254
Opposition party members are
demonstrating on the streets,

435
00:36:55,352 --> 00:36:57,874
so it's rare to see them in congress.

436
00:36:58,152 --> 00:37:01,527
Thank you for today, Congressman.

437
00:37:02,535 --> 00:37:04,159
I will see you at the event.

438
00:37:04,312 --> 00:37:07,699
- Yes, Jeongyeon.
- See you again.

439
00:37:10,587 --> 00:37:15,062
Was gathering members
from both parties your idea?

440
00:37:15,174 --> 00:37:16,696
It wasn't.

441
00:37:16,921 --> 00:37:18,759
Miss Jeongyeon suggested it.

442
00:37:18,858 --> 00:37:20,652
I see...

443
00:37:20,756 --> 00:37:22,131
Why are you asking?

444
00:37:22,227 --> 00:37:25,107
No reason, really.

445
00:37:29,398 --> 00:37:31,133
Next on our schedule?

446
00:37:31,259 --> 00:37:34,112
We have a meeting with
the event's official sponsors right away,

447
00:37:34,219 --> 00:37:37,621
and this evening a dinner with chairmen
from the Korean Federation of Industries.

448
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:39,139
This is hard labor...

449
00:37:39,209 --> 00:37:42,302
What are you doing here, Jeongyeon?

450
00:37:45,468 --> 00:37:49,093
Will you participate as
well, Congressman Jo?

451
00:37:49,353 --> 00:37:52,130
A Night for the Olympics...

452
00:37:52,257 --> 00:37:54,001
I can't say...

453
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:56,792
With all those factions trying
to overthrow the government,

454
00:37:56,888 --> 00:37:59,864
I wonder if I'll have any time
to pop champagne bottles.

455
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:04,497
I knew how busy you would be,
so I didn't prepare any invitation.

456
00:38:05,924 --> 00:38:08,248
I will get going.

457
00:38:16,967 --> 00:38:18,566
How do you do, Congressman?

458
00:38:18,772 --> 00:38:20,032
Jeongyeon.

459
00:38:20,186 --> 00:38:23,895
May I have a word with you?

460
00:38:31,186 --> 00:38:38,001
I sincerely hope Chairman Hwang
will stop with this foolish behavior.

461
00:38:38,547 --> 00:38:42,242
So you're asking me to
convey those words to him.

462
00:38:42,382 --> 00:38:44,677
If you care about him...

463
00:38:45,027 --> 00:38:49,380
By any chance... I noticed people
have been put on my trail.

464
00:38:49,505 --> 00:38:51,857
Are those subordinates of yours?

465
00:38:54,404 --> 00:38:56,125
They are.

466
00:38:56,713 --> 00:39:03,310
So you're also the one
who's blackmailing my father?

467
00:39:03,954 --> 00:39:05,707
Black...mailing?!

468
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:09,874
He's been receiving
strange documents as of late.

469
00:39:10,214 --> 00:39:12,603
Not to mention phone threats.

470
00:39:12,943 --> 00:39:15,444
Are you responsible for that?

471
00:39:17,361 --> 00:39:21,136
Then... Just like us...

472
00:39:21,472 --> 00:39:24,551
What are you trying to say?

473
00:39:24,768 --> 00:39:28,134
Would it be possible to
speak with him on the phone?

474
00:39:33,087 --> 00:39:38,891
I'm being harassed by the same people
who are threatening Chairman Hwang.

475
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:45,412
And you expect me to believe that?

476
00:39:56,405 --> 00:39:58,653
- Agreement -
I approve the constitutional amendment

477
00:40:04,265 --> 00:40:08,448
I admit I've been suspicious of
Chairman Hwang all this time.

478
00:40:08,812 --> 00:40:11,863
But we must meet
and find a solution right now.

479
00:40:17,265 --> 00:40:21,878
I never said it was Lee Seongmo.

480
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:27,138
I'm afraid it was pure conjecture on your part.

481
00:40:27,247 --> 00:40:30,274
Didn't you see his face
when you exchanged that account?

482
00:40:30,367 --> 00:40:32,332
I never saw his face even once.

483
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:36,656
And that is why I don't know
whether it was Lee Seongmo myself.

484
00:40:36,748 --> 00:40:40,836
Still, didn't you have a copy of it?

485
00:40:41,115 --> 00:40:44,069
Are you telling me you
didn't make a copy yourself, just in case?

486
00:40:44,321 --> 00:40:48,355
Why wouldn't I have tried that?

487
00:40:52,529 --> 00:40:54,739
We tried that countless times,

488
00:40:54,843 --> 00:40:57,636
but this is all we got.

489
00:41:01,164 --> 00:41:04,551
It's obvious this is
an ANSP agent's doing.

490
00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:07,294
They used an
anti-copy spray on this.

491
00:41:07,434 --> 00:41:09,229
It's a recent development from Japan,

492
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:11,958
and they're using it
all the time at the ANSP.

493
00:41:14,897 --> 00:41:17,710
Still, there is good news,

494
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:22,119
the fact that Lee Seongmo
doesn't know anything.

495
00:41:22,538 --> 00:41:23,853
I see.

496
00:41:23,966 --> 00:41:26,609
Seongmo ended up
unfairly bearing the brunt.

497
00:41:26,735 --> 00:41:30,584
What do you plan to do now?

498
00:41:32,886 --> 00:41:35,356
That man's requests are pretty straightforward.

499
00:41:35,846 --> 00:41:38,393
He will call us back with a time and place,

500
00:41:38,505 --> 00:41:43,385
so gather those opposition party members,
and form a six-man committee...

501
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:46,996
in support of the constitutional amendment.

502
00:41:49,543 --> 00:41:51,712
Congressman Min.

503
00:41:52,746 --> 00:41:56,702
Seems that we're forced
to comply with his requests.

504
00:41:58,899 --> 00:42:04,735
Since he's got the account,
I'm afraid we have no choice.

505
00:42:55,256 --> 00:42:57,832
Miju, open the door!

506
00:42:58,006 --> 00:43:00,357
Hey, Lee Miju!

507
00:43:01,673 --> 00:43:04,304
Lee Miju, open the damn door!

508
00:43:05,872 --> 00:43:07,733
I said open!

509
00:43:08,909 --> 00:43:11,008
Lee Miju!

510
00:43:14,563 --> 00:43:16,660
Minwoo...

511
00:43:20,553 --> 00:43:22,442
Minwoo!

512
00:43:23,849 --> 00:43:26,963
What's wrong with you?
Minwoo.

513
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:30,099
Let's run away.

514
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:32,940
Minwoo...

515
00:43:33,038 --> 00:43:35,095
Let's just run away.

516
00:43:35,648 --> 00:43:38,076
Let's go, you silly.

517
00:43:39,297 --> 00:43:42,135
Let's just go abroad, the two of us.

518
00:43:45,658 --> 00:43:47,793
We can just hide,

519
00:43:47,989 --> 00:43:54,021
and never have to face my
parents or your brother again.

520
00:43:54,627 --> 00:43:57,674
Let's just live happily together.

521
00:44:01,575 --> 00:44:03,877
Make up your mind.

522
00:44:05,112 --> 00:44:07,866
Is it me or your brother?

523
00:44:10,306 --> 00:44:11,882
If...

524
00:44:13,288 --> 00:44:15,222
If I lose you, I will have lost everything.

525
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,439
But your brother is different.

526
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:21,777
I'm sorry, Minwoo.

527
00:44:22,448 --> 00:44:26,004
I can't do what you're asking me.

528
00:44:30,916 --> 00:44:34,119
Without you, I will die!

529
00:44:38,164 --> 00:44:41,131
Even that is not enough for you?

530
00:44:42,616 --> 00:44:45,806
Is that not enough? Not even that?

531
00:44:54,504 --> 00:44:57,046
Answer me.

532
00:45:01,371 --> 00:45:07,010
Don't come here again.

533
00:45:08,887 --> 00:45:10,929
Lee Miju.

534
00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:17,759
Pretend we don't know each other,

535
00:45:18,919 --> 00:45:23,637
and don't ever show up before me again.

536
00:45:25,792 --> 00:45:28,087
So what you're saying...

537
00:45:34,881 --> 00:45:38,408
is that you don't
care even if this will kill me.

538
00:45:46,450 --> 00:45:48,471
I'm sorry.

539
00:46:04,629 --> 00:46:10,789
I want to run away with you, too.

540
00:46:11,848 --> 00:46:13,728
But...

541
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:17,128
But.

542
00:46:37,595 --> 00:46:39,232
Here.... Let's drink.

543
00:46:39,455 --> 00:46:44,340
He will be handling
all the funding from now on.

544
00:46:45,082 --> 00:46:46,471
I'm Hwang Jeongshik.

545
00:46:46,577 --> 00:46:47,769
I'll be counting on you.

546
00:46:47,853 --> 00:46:50,398
That's what we should say to you.

547
00:46:50,494 --> 00:46:54,983
Anyhow... Seeing you show so much
passion for our democratization efforts...

548
00:46:55,095 --> 00:46:56,943
- can only give us strength.
- Yes...

549
00:46:57,027 --> 00:47:00,852
Aigoo... I'm just an ordinary citizen.

550
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:06,669
Not just me, but every
Korean wishes for democracy.

551
00:47:08,027 --> 00:47:12,115
If a better world comes for us all,
we will repay this debt of gratitude.

552
00:47:12,222 --> 00:47:13,206
Don't say that.

553
00:47:13,315 --> 00:47:15,302
I'm not doing it for that reason.

554
00:47:15,410 --> 00:47:21,288
Just build a world where ordinary
people like me can live in peace.

555
00:47:21,413 --> 00:47:23,128
We will give our best.

556
00:47:23,198 --> 00:47:25,813
- Allow me to pour you a drink.
- Yes.

557
00:47:29,984 --> 00:47:33,813
He has more confidence in
President Noh than I could ever imagine.

558
00:47:33,924 --> 00:47:36,225
President Noh is practically
reporting to Congressman Jo...

559
00:47:36,337 --> 00:47:38,702
how the opposition
party members are reacting.

560
00:47:41,515 --> 00:47:45,699
Jo Pilyeon paved the way for us.

561
00:47:46,119 --> 00:47:48,610
All we need to do is take advantage of it.

562
00:47:49,198 --> 00:47:51,319
You want to spread false information?

563
00:47:51,416 --> 00:47:52,814
Yes.

564
00:47:53,117 --> 00:47:54,726
Only then we'll be
able to rescue my brother.

565
00:47:54,838 --> 00:47:57,766
I'll take care of the private lending market.

566
00:47:58,001 --> 00:48:01,979
So I guess all I have to do
is meeting Congressman Min.

567
00:48:11,396 --> 00:48:14,713
I've been contacted.

568
00:48:14,909 --> 00:48:16,326
What did he say?

569
00:48:16,437 --> 00:48:17,946
Will he finally bring you that account?

570
00:48:18,072 --> 00:48:23,453
He said he would bring it to you when
you meet in secret with the opposition.

571
00:48:23,577 --> 00:48:24,967
Time and place?

572
00:48:25,106 --> 00:48:27,787
This Friday at six.

573
00:48:28,524 --> 00:48:33,381
The train for Busan
leaving from Seoul Station.

574
00:48:33,487 --> 00:48:34,908
Train?!

575
00:48:35,032 --> 00:48:37,458
By the time you reach Daejeon Station,

576
00:48:37,883 --> 00:48:40,914
you will meet by the dining coach.

577
00:48:41,939 --> 00:48:43,874
A train...

578
00:48:44,042 --> 00:48:46,239
Daejeon Station?!

579
00:48:46,435 --> 00:48:51,739
But these days the opposition
is under strict surveillance.

580
00:48:52,383 --> 00:48:55,210
Will you be able to contact them?

581
00:48:56,386 --> 00:48:57,919
You don't need to worry about that.

582
00:48:58,059 --> 00:49:00,984
I have a plan myself.

583
00:49:02,132 --> 00:49:07,398
Here... Assisting the opposition
party members in this situation must be hard,

584
00:49:07,539 --> 00:49:09,969
so eat to your hearts' content.

585
00:49:10,375 --> 00:49:13,952
I wonder if we
really can accept all this.

586
00:49:14,094 --> 00:49:17,444
Ehh... How can you say that?

587
00:49:18,187 --> 00:49:19,488
Myeongwol.

588
00:49:19,617 --> 00:49:23,407
All these folks will
become brilliant politicians.

589
00:49:23,533 --> 00:49:25,674
So you must treat them well.

590
00:49:25,842 --> 00:49:28,067
Yes, Orabeoni...

591
00:49:28,459 --> 00:49:30,612
Here... Let's make a toast.

592
00:49:31,254 --> 00:49:33,966
To democracy.

593
00:49:34,076 --> 00:49:35,789
To democracy!

594
00:49:50,728 --> 00:49:51,953
Is that true?

595
00:49:52,076 --> 00:49:56,092
I've heard that straight from their aides,
so it's legit information.

596
00:49:56,197 --> 00:49:57,481
When are they going to meet?

597
00:49:57,588 --> 00:50:01,644
There will be a massive gathering
in Busan this Saturday.

598
00:50:01,987 --> 00:50:04,933
The ruling party members will
board the train headed for Busan...

599
00:50:05,136 --> 00:50:07,917
this Friday afternoon at six.

600
00:50:17,551 --> 00:50:18,852
Congressman Jo.

601
00:50:19,034 --> 00:50:20,784
It's me, Noh Gapsoo.

602
00:50:21,924 --> 00:50:27,767
We got our hands on quite
the interesting piece of information.

603
00:50:32,511 --> 00:50:34,571
The train for Busan?

604
00:50:34,697 --> 00:50:38,219
It's tomorrow afternoon at six,
the one departing from Seoul Station.

605
00:50:38,334 --> 00:50:40,236
Who would those
ruling party members be?

606
00:50:40,404 --> 00:50:43,633
We still have no names.

607
00:50:43,805 --> 00:50:47,969
They're hiding their identity even to the
opposition party members they approached.

608
00:50:48,084 --> 00:50:50,949
Their last secret meeting failed,

609
00:50:51,078 --> 00:50:53,539
so I see they've become a lot more meticulous.

610
00:50:53,664 --> 00:50:55,773
With Lee Seongmo in confinement,

611
00:50:55,912 --> 00:50:58,446
there's no way our
mission will be exposed.

612
00:50:58,572 --> 00:51:02,671
We must take this opportunity
to expose those traitors, got it?

613
00:51:02,777 --> 00:51:04,553
That's right.

614
00:51:05,351 --> 00:51:09,732
Right... You know that opposition
party members have been invited...

615
00:51:09,927 --> 00:51:11,900
to that fund-raising in Seoul as well?

616
00:51:12,029 --> 00:51:15,356
I've already selected the
agents who will be dispatched there.

617
00:51:15,472 --> 00:51:16,815
Well done.

618
00:51:16,929 --> 00:51:20,527
We can't take our eyes off
of them for a single moment.

619
00:51:20,641 --> 00:51:23,649
You never know what they might do.

620
00:51:47,021 --> 00:51:48,672
How are you, Congressman?

621
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:51,030
Welcome, Director Hwang.

622
00:51:51,289 --> 00:51:53,725
I see you were here already.

623
00:51:55,178 --> 00:51:58,030
You'll come to the event tomorrow, right?

624
00:51:58,159 --> 00:52:01,386
Actually, it looks like I'll have
to be in the provinces tomorrow,

625
00:52:01,509 --> 00:52:02,929
so I might not be able to come.

626
00:52:03,044 --> 00:52:04,961
I'm sure you do...

627
00:52:05,071 --> 00:52:09,618
The train... Daejeon.
Dining Coach.

628
00:52:09,932 --> 00:52:11,984
Don't look surprised.

629
00:52:12,322 --> 00:52:15,175
You're under surveillance.

630
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:23,669
Look at this and
just keep listening to me.

631
00:52:42,895 --> 00:52:44,522
You'll have to follow us a moment.

632
00:52:44,613 --> 00:52:46,518
What is the matter?

633
00:52:47,546 --> 00:52:49,838
Who are you people?
What are you trying to do?

634
00:52:49,935 --> 00:52:52,681
Let go...
Let me go!

635
00:52:59,670 --> 00:53:01,072
Go.

636
00:53:16,117 --> 00:53:21,083
I told you I would be meeting those
congressmen because of the event, didn't I?

637
00:53:21,693 --> 00:53:24,931
Is this how you pester innocent citizens?

638
00:53:25,015 --> 00:53:27,002
I apologize.

639
00:53:27,124 --> 00:53:30,711
I think my men made a big mistake.

640
00:53:49,375 --> 00:53:51,598
Will you wake up?

641
00:53:53,238 --> 00:53:54,960
I apologize.

642
00:54:00,222 --> 00:54:01,823
Good job, Jeongyeon.

643
00:54:01,913 --> 00:54:03,784
For this little?

644
00:54:03,882 --> 00:54:06,155
You told Congressman Jang?

645
00:54:06,281 --> 00:54:07,331
Yeah.

646
00:54:07,456 --> 00:54:09,149
He really seemed surprised.

647
00:54:09,242 --> 00:54:12,409
When they're led astray tomorrow,

648
00:54:12,534 --> 00:54:15,952
Jo Pilyeon's attention will
move to the event instead.

649
00:54:16,799 --> 00:54:20,179
One single false step and it's all over for us.

650
00:54:20,273 --> 00:54:22,678
We must be alert at all times.

651
00:54:23,018 --> 00:54:26,324
Guess you'll be busy,
preparing the entire event.

652
00:54:26,979 --> 00:54:29,260
It will be a succession of
sleepless nights starting today.

653
00:54:29,330 --> 00:54:31,891
Right... Need any help?

654
00:54:32,017 --> 00:54:37,276
If it's all right with you,
I can send someone your way.

655
00:54:40,147 --> 00:54:43,599
- Let's do it again.
- Welcome.

656
00:54:43,795 --> 00:54:46,902
- Again.
- Welcome.

657
00:54:49,121 --> 00:54:52,457
- Again.
- Welcome.

658
00:55:56,544 --> 00:55:59,497
They're still following us, right?

659
00:55:59,819 --> 00:56:01,512
Yes, Chairman.

660
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:07,320
Yes.

661
00:56:07,950 --> 00:56:09,195
What?

662
00:56:09,350 --> 00:56:12,723
Someone leaked
details of our meeting again?

663
00:56:15,298 --> 00:56:17,880
Take Min Honggi to the event as well.

664
00:56:17,995 --> 00:56:21,680
The opposition party members
will be here soon.

665
00:56:33,095 --> 00:56:36,832
With that wig, I almost can't
recognize Youngchul Hyungnim.

666
00:56:48,064 --> 00:56:49,405
How did it go?

667
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:51,640
Did you see them board that train?

668
00:56:51,803 --> 00:56:54,881
They suddenly turned around.

669
00:56:55,130 --> 00:56:56,725
They did what?

670
00:56:56,851 --> 00:56:59,327
Are you telling me
there was another leak?

671
00:56:59,481 --> 00:57:00,639
You were mistaken.

672
00:57:00,747 --> 00:57:04,113
It's not Lee Seongmo,
the culprit was someone else.

673
00:57:04,974 --> 00:57:06,269
Congressman.

674
00:57:06,493 --> 00:57:10,803
The opposition party members
appeared at the fund-raising event.

675
00:57:12,819 --> 00:57:15,755
They still haven't given up.

676
00:57:15,848 --> 00:57:18,141
And what is that supposed to mean?

677
00:57:18,266 --> 00:57:25,392
Their secret meeting might
in fact take place at the event itself.

678
00:57:25,951 --> 00:57:28,083
You said you dispatched agents there, right?

679
00:57:28,187 --> 00:57:30,827
That's right, but it'll be hard
to control the situation.

680
00:57:30,952 --> 00:57:33,888
Send everyone on emergency footing,
we must surround the place.

681
00:57:33,986 --> 00:57:38,017
What?! There was another leak?

682
00:57:38,604 --> 00:57:39,682
So?

683
00:57:43,069 --> 00:57:44,300
It's an emergency.

684
00:57:44,496 --> 00:57:45,710
You two stay behind,

685
00:57:45,815 --> 00:57:47,412
and everyone else
will go to the event.

686
00:57:47,538 --> 00:57:49,301
Follow me.

687
00:57:56,299 --> 00:57:57,703
What's the matter?

688
00:57:57,827 --> 00:58:00,651
Looks like there was another leak.

689
00:58:00,781 --> 00:58:04,443
Ohh... Went out a moment and told them.

690
00:58:04,555 --> 00:58:06,348
- What?
- What?

691
00:58:06,488 --> 00:58:09,996
I know a little black magic, you know...

692
00:58:11,596 --> 00:58:12,592
See?

693
00:58:12,697 --> 00:58:14,661
Told you it wasn't him, didn't I?

694
00:58:14,773 --> 00:58:16,144
You little...

695
00:58:16,312 --> 00:58:20,744
Wait until I leave this
place, then you're dead.

696
00:58:20,898 --> 00:58:24,243
- Go fetch me some water. I'm a little thirsty.
- Yes. Chief.

697
00:58:45,566 --> 00:58:47,596
Chairman.

698
00:58:47,812 --> 00:58:51,094
It's your invitation
to the fund-raising event.

699
00:58:52,270 --> 00:58:53,599
I'm not going.

700
00:58:53,850 --> 00:58:58,708
The singer at the event
will be Cha Soojeong.

701
00:59:13,167 --> 00:59:14,826
- Singer, Cha Soojeong -

702
00:59:27,909 --> 00:59:31,875
Stop investigating on Lee Miju.

703
00:59:32,029 --> 00:59:33,317
What?

704
00:59:34,632 --> 00:59:38,143
Yes. I will.

705
00:59:42,717 --> 00:59:45,211
I'm trembling for you, really...

706
00:59:45,309 --> 00:59:47,878
- Soojeong.
- Eonni.

707
00:59:49,885 --> 00:59:52,792
I'd like a word in private with Soojeong,
can you leave us alone a moment?

708
00:59:52,918 --> 00:59:54,933
Yes, sure.

709
01:00:06,145 --> 01:00:09,810
Can you remember these faces?

710
01:00:12,610 --> 01:00:15,832
Are these the ruling party members?

711
01:00:15,956 --> 01:00:18,000
Are you confident you can do it?

712
01:00:18,112 --> 01:00:19,326
Yes.

713
01:00:19,441 --> 01:00:23,688
Succeeding is the only
way to rescue my brother.

714
01:00:42,144 --> 01:00:44,849
Thank you for coming,
President Lee Gangmo.

715
01:00:44,942 --> 01:00:48,655
I have high expectations
about tonight's party.

716
01:00:51,743 --> 01:00:55,720
I'm sure you'll welcome me
even without an invite, Jeongyeon?

717
01:00:56,209 --> 01:00:57,797
It's been a long time.

718
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:59,718
Isn't it a wonderful night?

719
01:00:59,824 --> 01:01:02,944
I hear there were no
demonstrations in Seoul today?

720
01:01:03,057 --> 01:01:05,643
There have to be days like this.

721
01:01:06,594 --> 01:01:11,270
Since you organized it, I'm
expecting even more from this party.

722
01:01:12,725 --> 01:01:16,504
I'm sure it won't disappoint you.

729
01:01:38,344 --> 01:01:41,008
I'll never forget what you did for me
by paying my hospital bills.

730
01:01:41,124 --> 01:01:42,262
Your hospital bills?!

731
01:01:42,347 --> 01:01:44,846
Sometimes technology is not
the only thing that can solve problems.

732
01:01:44,931 --> 01:01:46,200
You need people to do that.

733
01:01:46,275 --> 01:01:48,095
Are you trying to bring me down?

734
01:01:48,220 --> 01:01:50,915
I will ruin you and your mother.

735
01:01:51,065 --> 01:01:53,696
There might be a secret bipartisan
agreement on the constitutional amendment.

736
01:01:53,762 --> 01:01:56,187
I guess this will be a good opportunity
to find out who the traitors are.

737
01:01:56,299 --> 01:01:59,357
Is throwing rocks and molotovs
what you call democracy?

738
01:01:59,404 --> 01:02:01,161
You should be ashamed of yourself!

739
01:02:01,227 --> 01:02:02,392
Watch what you say!

740
01:02:02,486 --> 01:02:05,365
Lee Miju was hiding a child.

741
01:02:05,459 --> 01:02:07,140
Bring me to that child.

742
01:02:07,232 --> 01:02:09,201
I said turn the car around!

743
