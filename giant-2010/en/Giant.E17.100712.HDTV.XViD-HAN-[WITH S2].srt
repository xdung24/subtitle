00:00:13,641 --> 00:00:16,406
Chairman Hong asked me for this...

6
00:00:16,621 --> 00:00:18,678
You take care of it.

7
00:00:24,209 --> 00:00:26,137
Seonbaenim.

00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:39,694
<i>My housemaid asked me 
to find her family.</i>

9
00:00:39,801 --> 00:00:41,986
<i>Father: Lee Daesu
Mother: Jeong Youngseon</i>

10
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,213
<i>Oldest Brother: Lee Seongmo
Second Brother: Lee Gangmo
Youngest Brother: Infant</i>

11
00:00:46,604 --> 00:00:48,442
Miju.

12
00:00:52,141 --> 00:00:53,747
Miju!

13
00:01:46,012 --> 00:01:47,649
Miju.

14
00:01:47,755 --> 00:01:49,318
Are you sleeping?

15
00:01:49,601 --> 00:01:50,830
Lee Miju.

16
00:01:50,952 --> 00:01:53,061
<i>Oppa.</i>

17
00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:55,347
Where have you been?

18
00:01:55,445 --> 00:01:58,932
Know how worried I was,
waiting for you?

19
00:01:59,378 --> 00:02:00,835
Bought some sweet bread.

20
00:02:00,945 --> 00:02:02,296
Gotta be good, uh?

21
00:02:02,392 --> 00:02:05,414
How did you guess?
I was really hungry.

22
00:02:05,562 --> 00:02:07,648
Here... Take it.

23
00:02:08,237 --> 00:02:09,870
- Let's go in.
- Yeah.

24
00:02:09,993 --> 00:02:12,105
<i>Lee Gangmo!</i>

25
00:02:13,848 --> 00:02:15,542
What are you doing?

26
00:02:17,101 --> 00:02:19,351
You are under arrest for the
murder of Chairman Hong Gipyo.

27
00:02:19,462 --> 00:02:20,714
- Escort him down.
- Let go!

28
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,334
<i>Follow us!</i>

29
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,458
Oppa... Little Oppa!

30
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,489
<i>- Stop it!
- Let me go!</i>

31
00:02:25,551 --> 00:02:27,441
What are you doing to my brother?

32
00:02:27,515 --> 00:02:28,534
You just stay out of this.

33
00:02:28,595 --> 00:02:31,799
Oppa... Gangmo Oppa!
Ajeosshi! Oppa...

34
00:02:31,861 --> 00:02:34,392
Let my brother go!

35
00:02:34,588 --> 00:02:37,314
- Miju!
- Oppa... Gangmo Oppa!

36
00:02:37,387 --> 00:02:40,914
Let go! I didn't kill him!
I said let go!

37
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:43,366
<i>- Miju!
- Take him.</i>

38
00:02:43,611 --> 00:02:44,753
Oppa...

39
00:02:44,839 --> 00:02:47,337
Don't you worry.
I'll be out in no time.

40
00:02:47,435 --> 00:02:49,375
Don't worry, Miju!

41
00:02:49,535 --> 00:02:51,560
Oppa...

42
00:02:55,292 --> 00:02:57,281
Oppa...

43
00:03:02,213 --> 00:03:03,883
<i>Oppa...</i>

44
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:06,313
I said I didn't kill him!

45
00:03:11,494 --> 00:03:13,556
It wasn't me. Let go!

46
00:03:13,642 --> 00:03:15,311
Just go in!

47
00:03:29,828 --> 00:03:31,935
It's my brother.

48
00:03:33,744 --> 00:03:35,937
He's the brother I was looking for...

49
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:38,061
Gangmo...

50
00:03:42,837 --> 00:03:47,533
And I shot him like a fool,
without even realizing who he was.

51
00:03:47,607 --> 00:03:49,682
Seonbaenim!

52
00:03:50,283 --> 00:03:54,236
- I tried to kill my own brother!
- Calm down.

53
00:03:54,457 --> 00:03:55,700
Gangmo...

54
00:03:55,823 --> 00:03:57,499
Gangmo.

55
00:03:58,168 --> 00:04:00,108
Gangmo...

56
00:04:00,469 --> 00:04:02,685
Gangmo!

57
00:04:04,254 --> 00:04:06,344
Gangmo...

58
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:39,773
What do you want now?

59
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,275
I have no accounts.

60
00:04:56,862 --> 00:05:01,870
But... You said you
work for the KCIA, right?

61
00:05:03,331 --> 00:05:05,469
I have a favor to ask you.

62
00:05:05,604 --> 00:05:10,220
My brother was arrested by
the police under false charges.

63
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:13,007
<i>If you could help me out...</i>

64
00:05:38,624 --> 00:05:40,793
Big Oppa?!

65
00:05:54,858 --> 00:05:57,517
S...eongmo Oppa?!

66
00:05:58,045 --> 00:06:01,045
- Miju...
- Oppa!

67
00:06:18,308 --> 00:06:20,149
Miju...

68
00:06:25,145 --> 00:06:28,183
Little Oppa was framed for murder.

69
00:06:28,501 --> 00:06:32,312
He didn't kill the chairman, Oppa.

70
00:06:32,787 --> 00:06:34,567
I know.

71
00:06:35,338 --> 00:06:37,378
I know, Miju.

72
00:06:38,407 --> 00:06:42,527
How can we help him?
What do we do now?

73
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:45,780
Don't worry.

74
00:06:47,599 --> 00:06:49,365
It's all...

75
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,618
It's all my fault.

76
00:06:53,011 --> 00:06:55,566
It's all my fault.

77
00:06:56,519 --> 00:07:01,017
Don't worry, Miju.

78
00:07:01,987 --> 00:07:04,233
Big Oppa...

79
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,988
Miju...

80
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:40,688
<i>I remember this photo.</i>

81
00:07:41,766 --> 00:07:44,555
Was it Christmas?

82
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:50,138
We were really happy back then...

83
00:07:55,362 --> 00:07:58,167
I thought that if we found you,

84
00:07:59,184 --> 00:08:06,496
we would get to live happily
together like back in the day.

85
00:08:17,462 --> 00:08:19,881
Don't worry, Miju.

86
00:08:19,992 --> 00:08:25,528
I'll get Gangmo out of there.

87
00:08:27,332 --> 00:08:29,302
<i>I will...</i>

88
00:08:32,654 --> 00:08:35,489
help Gangmo get out of prison.

89
00:08:36,851 --> 00:08:39,233
Big Oppa...

90
00:08:55,445 --> 00:08:58,371
Are you going to keep playing innocent?

91
00:08:58,476 --> 00:09:00,359
I've never been to that cottage!

92
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:03,207
And neither did I meet Chairman Hong!

93
00:09:04,758 --> 00:09:07,983
Can't you see we have proof right here?

94
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,397
Then,

95
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:15,853
tell me why this was found in
the hands of the late Hong Gipyo.

96
00:09:16,146 --> 00:09:18,396
Explain it to me, you fool!

97
00:09:18,492 --> 00:09:22,546
Someone put it there
on purpose to frame me.

98
00:09:22,683 --> 00:09:24,262
What?!

99
00:09:25,026 --> 00:09:26,892
And who would that be?

100
00:09:28,914 --> 00:09:30,735
That...

101
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,676
What is the matter?

102
00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:41,751
Hwang Jeongshik.

103
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:44,434
You're under arrest for
the murder of Hong Gipyo.

104
00:09:47,705 --> 00:09:49,251
Dad...

105
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:50,822
It wasn't me, Dad!

106
00:09:50,884 --> 00:09:52,124
What's wrong with you?

107
00:09:52,197 --> 00:09:54,839
You're calling my son a murderer?

108
00:09:55,614 --> 00:09:57,270
What is all this about?

109
00:09:57,513 --> 00:10:01,147
It's the copy of Chairman Hong's
account we found in his room.

110
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:03,270
<i>Say what?!</i>

111
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,879
Jeongshik, you lousy son of a...

112
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:12,845
You kill him, and try to
frame Gangmo for his murder?

113
00:10:12,935 --> 00:10:14,712
Dad...

114
00:10:14,957 --> 00:10:16,467
Go ahead and arrest him!

115
00:10:16,627 --> 00:10:18,382
If you committed a crime,
you should pay for it.

116
00:10:18,468 --> 00:10:21,679
Dad... He fell by himself!

117
00:10:21,765 --> 00:10:26,774
I didn't kill him! I said no!

118
00:10:44,274 --> 00:10:48,533
It's Lee Gangmo who will take the
blame and do time in the can, anyway.

119
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:51,369
There is nothing to be afraid of.

120
00:10:51,626 --> 00:10:54,916
All I need is to wait
until the right time comes.

121
00:10:55,199 --> 00:10:57,617
Until the right time comes...

122
00:11:20,908 --> 00:11:22,917
<i>Your engagement is tomorrow.</i>

123
00:11:23,371 --> 00:11:25,973
Drink this and go to sleep.

124
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:42,658
Gangmo.

125
00:11:56,787 --> 00:11:59,545
<i>Aigoo... Here you are.</i>

126
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:02,875
<i>Agasshi, it's getting late.</i>

127
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:08,753
The chairman is 
waiting for you outside!

128
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:12,744
Yes.

129
00:12:12,904 --> 00:12:14,721
<i>But, Agasshi.</i>

130
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,611
What's wrong with your face?

131
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:21,153
<i>You look like you didn't sleep at all.</i>

132
00:12:22,522 --> 00:12:25,259
Does Shideok have any news of Gangmo?

133
00:12:25,394 --> 00:12:32,613
He left early in the morning,
saying he'll prove Gangmo was framed.

134
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,822
<i>Framed?!</i>

135
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:37,376
Did Shideok say Gangmo was framed?

136
00:12:37,468 --> 00:12:39,133
Yes.

137
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:42,300
And did he mention any evidence?

138
00:12:44,338 --> 00:12:46,400
Evidence proving he was framed.

139
00:12:46,613 --> 00:12:49,482
I didn't hear any of that?!

140
00:12:50,635 --> 00:12:54,431
What do we owe your sudden
interest in Gangmo's problems to?

141
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:58,731
Are you aware of anything,
by any chance?

142
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:02,140
What would I possibly know?

143
00:13:02,669 --> 00:13:05,190
Ahh... It's hot.

144
00:13:11,188 --> 00:13:13,827
<i>{\a6}*beef boiled in soy</i>

145
00:13:11,188 --> 00:13:13,827
Wow... There's even jangjorim* today.

146
00:13:13,901 --> 00:13:16,682
- Bon appetit.
- You as well, Sir.

147
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:24,016
Is anything the matter?

148
00:13:24,151 --> 00:13:27,355
<i>You haven't touched your plate.</i>

149
00:13:27,748 --> 00:13:31,133
Did you two have an argument?

150
00:13:32,252 --> 00:13:34,029
Argument?!

151
00:13:34,169 --> 00:13:36,681
If anything's wrong,
I'll take you to the hospital.

152
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:39,198
Excuse me.

153
00:13:41,406 --> 00:13:43,827
Ahh... Have you seen the news?

154
00:13:43,936 --> 00:13:46,196
So the man who killed Chairman
Hong of Daeryuk Construction...

155
00:13:46,319 --> 00:13:47,841
was that Lee Gangmo
from our company, right?

156
00:13:47,964 --> 00:13:50,075
Yeah! I saw that, too.

157
00:13:50,198 --> 00:13:54,298
I never saw him that way...
That's scary.

158
00:13:54,498 --> 00:13:56,864
Lee Gangmo is innocent.

159
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:02,010
He's not the culprit.

160
00:14:03,618 --> 00:14:05,963
The truth will be revealed soon.

161
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:21,608
Yes, I wanted to have a word
with you regarding Lee Gangmo.

162
00:14:23,253 --> 00:14:27,270
Once Yeom Shideok arrives,
please tell him to give me a call.

163
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:30,157
Yes, I'll be counting on you.

164
00:14:30,341 --> 00:14:32,588
<i>Yes, thank you.</i>

165
00:14:35,006 --> 00:14:39,082
<i>I want the upcoming apartment sale
to be jumpstarted by aggressive marketing.</i>

166
00:14:39,241 --> 00:14:41,298
Hwang Jeongyeon, you...

167
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,749
Hwang Jeongyeon.

168
00:14:47,927 --> 00:14:48,862
Yes?

169
00:14:48,975 --> 00:14:51,082
What did I just say?

170
00:14:51,905 --> 00:14:55,476
What are you thinking?

171
00:14:56,318 --> 00:14:58,582
Agasshi! Agasshi.

172
00:14:58,729 --> 00:14:59,895
Agasshi...

173
00:15:00,018 --> 00:15:02,326
Any news of Gangmo?

174
00:15:03,504 --> 00:15:07,138
- Gangmo is at the police station.
- What?

175
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:09,323
We're having a meeting.

176
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:11,836
They arrested him?

177
00:15:13,555 --> 00:15:15,011
Hwang Jeongyeon!

178
00:15:15,107 --> 00:15:16,826
I apologize.

179
00:15:26,999 --> 00:15:30,547
<i>Stop using your heads just
as an ornament, will you?</i>

180
00:15:30,719 --> 00:15:34,856
Are you fools taking
my words lightly? Uh?

181
00:15:35,087 --> 00:15:37,336
Do it right!

182
00:15:42,811 --> 00:15:44,542
What is it?

183
00:15:44,842 --> 00:15:46,985
Let's knock before we enter,
people are working here.

184
00:15:47,095 --> 00:15:51,209
Gangmo was arrested yesterday.

185
00:15:51,319 --> 00:15:52,841
Really?

186
00:15:53,059 --> 00:15:55,858
If you commit a crime,
that's the most natural conclusion.

187
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,181
But why are you telling me that?

188
00:15:58,316 --> 00:16:00,047
The day Chairman Hong was murdered,

189
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:04,591
you went to his cottage
with Park Sotae, didn't you?

190
00:16:08,614 --> 00:16:10,332
Leave us alone.

191
00:16:10,473 --> 00:16:11,989
Now!

192
00:16:18,641 --> 00:16:20,249
What kind of bullshit
are you throwing around?

193
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,643
Don't try to deny it.

194
00:16:22,939 --> 00:16:25,147
That day, you asked me
for Gangmo's car keys, and...

195
00:16:25,196 --> 00:16:27,124
You little...

196
00:16:27,995 --> 00:16:29,493
Get out.

197
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:31,972
Get the hell out!

198
00:16:32,561 --> 00:16:34,575
Get out, Shideok.

199
00:16:42,051 --> 00:16:43,790
Be honest.

200
00:16:43,978 --> 00:16:46,281
Did you go there or not?

201
00:16:48,724 --> 00:16:50,259
Why, if I said I did,

202
00:16:50,615 --> 00:16:54,408
are you going to report me
to the police or something?

203
00:16:54,602 --> 00:16:56,851
Don't see any reason why I shouldn't?!

204
00:16:59,336 --> 00:17:01,378
Listen, Hwang Jeongyeon.

205
00:17:01,463 --> 00:17:04,173
Might have different mothers,
but I'm still your brother.

206
00:17:04,332 --> 00:17:07,026
How could you frame
your brother for Gangmo's crimes?

207
00:17:07,116 --> 00:17:08,799
I'm not framing anyone.

208
00:17:08,909 --> 00:17:12,622
- That day, you and Park Sotae...
- Report me to the police, then!

209
00:17:12,736 --> 00:17:16,304
I have plenty of people
willing to prove my alibi.

210
00:17:17,163 --> 00:17:19,876
If you have so many
people who can do that,

211
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:21,889
then let's hear who they are.

212
00:17:23,185 --> 00:17:24,700
Hwang Jeongyeon.

213
00:17:26,001 --> 00:17:28,814
I'm sure reporters will love this.

214
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,096
The daughter of Manbo
Construction's chairman,

215
00:17:31,194 --> 00:17:34,460
framing her own brother for murder.

216
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,203
Unless you want to make
a fool out of our family,

217
00:17:40,313 --> 00:17:43,301
let's start using this
thing over here to think.

218
00:17:43,448 --> 00:17:45,290
Is that clear?

219
00:17:56,519 --> 00:17:58,516
What the hell...

220
00:18:24,828 --> 00:18:26,951
Gangmo.

221
00:18:28,973 --> 00:18:31,383
What now?

222
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:38,335
What can I do now, Gangmo?

223
00:19:04,529 --> 00:19:06,788
What? Lee Gangmo was arrested?

224
00:19:06,898 --> 00:19:08,703
They brought him in last evening.

225
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:10,045
And the account?

226
00:19:10,237 --> 00:19:12,545
Did he have it?

227
00:19:12,668 --> 00:19:15,051
He's so strenuously
denying all his accusations,

228
00:19:15,146 --> 00:19:17,360
it seems like the questioning
is not going well.

229
00:19:18,287 --> 00:19:21,098
Anyhow, I'll have to
head to the station myself.

230
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:24,649
In the afternoon,
a lawyer will visit him.

231
00:19:25,149 --> 00:19:26,855
Lawyer?!

232
00:19:29,114 --> 00:19:33,059
Seeing how Chairman Hwang already
brought a lawyer into the picture,

233
00:19:33,194 --> 00:19:37,956
all this must have something
to do with that account.

234
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:49,195
I called you earlier, I'm Lawyer Lee.

235
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:50,820
Welcome.

236
00:19:50,992 --> 00:19:53,567
But, this gentleman?

237
00:19:54,343 --> 00:19:56,478
He's the director of
the Intelligence Department.

238
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:58,037
Is that so?

239
00:19:59,339 --> 00:20:01,168
Where is Lee Gangmo?

240
00:20:16,725 --> 00:20:18,615
You know me, right?

241
00:20:20,248 --> 00:20:24,347
This is Lee Sangtae,
he will represent you in court.

242
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:26,990
He will be of great help to you.

243
00:20:27,642 --> 00:20:31,742
Lee Gangmo.
Korea is a state of law.

244
00:20:31,854 --> 00:20:36,145
<i>No matter the crime, everyone 
has the right to be represen...</i>

245
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,358
Let's get to the point.

246
00:20:38,873 --> 00:20:41,547
I'm here to help you.

247
00:20:41,728 --> 00:20:44,483
If you have faith in me and
answer my questions sincerely...

248
00:20:44,606 --> 00:20:49,541
I'm tired as it is already,
so let's stop beating around the bush.

249
00:20:50,446 --> 00:20:54,176
- So, what I...
- You have the account, right?

250
00:20:54,665 --> 00:20:56,236
Chairman Hong's account.

251
00:20:56,371 --> 00:20:59,624
You killed him because of that.

252
00:21:00,276 --> 00:21:02,705
Go "represent" someone else.

253
00:21:03,761 --> 00:21:04,989
I need no help from you.

254
00:21:05,148 --> 00:21:07,048
Lee Gangmo!

255
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:19,027
If you cooperate, you can get a
reduced sentence of less than three years.

256
00:21:20,353 --> 00:21:22,575
I have no such thing...

257
00:21:23,214 --> 00:21:24,527
as that account.

258
00:21:24,687 --> 00:21:26,074
Is that so?

259
00:21:26,307 --> 00:21:28,198
Then, let's do this.

260
00:21:29,201 --> 00:21:32,777
It's true you killed Hong Gipyo anyway,

261
00:21:36,478 --> 00:21:39,999
so testify that you did it
under Jo Pilyeon's orders.

262
00:21:41,443 --> 00:21:45,069
Just a quick confession in court,

263
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:48,383
and I'll take care of everything else.

264
00:21:52,078 --> 00:21:57,004
If you keep this up, you'll get
up to seven years for murder, anyhow.

265
00:21:57,622 --> 00:22:01,534
I trust you don't want to spend the
prime of your life rotting in the can?

266
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:06,162
Murder?!

267
00:22:06,465 --> 00:22:08,673
How could Gangmo have done that?

268
00:22:08,771 --> 00:22:11,104
Shouldn't we get him a lawyer?

269
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:15,564
Find the best lawyer money can buy.

270
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,880
The very best.

271
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,451
All right.

272
00:22:19,611 --> 00:22:22,456
Dad, why burden yourself so much?

273
00:22:22,554 --> 00:22:26,103
People will start
thinking he's your son.

274
00:22:26,237 --> 00:22:27,526
You fool.

275
00:22:27,636 --> 00:22:32,806
For my sake, Gangmo will risk
his life without blinking once!

276
00:22:32,938 --> 00:22:36,758
He's a hundred, a thousand
times better than you!

277
00:22:37,402 --> 00:22:38,785
Listen to you...

278
00:22:38,956 --> 00:22:42,148
How can you say that...

279
00:22:45,303 --> 00:22:46,617
Yes?

280
00:22:49,387 --> 00:22:51,658
Director Jo is waiting outside.

281
00:22:52,321 --> 00:22:54,246
Director Jo?!

282
00:22:58,369 --> 00:23:01,016
How have you been, Chairman Hwang?

283
00:23:01,095 --> 00:23:02,004
Come on in.

284
00:23:02,164 --> 00:23:04,779
- Have a seat.
- Yes.

285
00:23:06,835 --> 00:23:09,895
But, what brings you here?

286
00:23:10,033 --> 00:23:13,605
I wonder why there are
no news of it being ready?

287
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:16,158
Ready?!

288
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:21,597
So you mean funding
for the election campaign.

289
00:23:21,707 --> 00:23:23,598
I never fail to mention it,

290
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:27,870
but this election will be a battle
between the governing party and our money.

291
00:23:28,082 --> 00:23:32,211
Min Honggi might have
gained their stamp of approval,

292
00:23:32,297 --> 00:23:37,212
but electors will follow the
money trail and let it sway them.

293
00:23:37,588 --> 00:23:42,265
I am doing my best
to gather those funds, but...

294
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:48,086
There is one way to cut our expenses...

295
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,456
Is there really such a way?

296
00:23:52,732 --> 00:23:56,399
If we get our hands on the
copy of Chairman Hong's account,

297
00:23:56,522 --> 00:24:01,972
we can kill off Min Honggi's candidacy
at the by-elections free of any expense.

298
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:09,718
But, how are we supposed
to find what doesn't exist?

299
00:24:09,816 --> 00:24:13,639
Why do you think
Lee Gangmo committed murder?

300
00:24:13,894 --> 00:24:20,182
Then, are you suggesting
Gangmo might have that account?

301
00:24:21,139 --> 00:24:23,067
Let's drop the act, shall we?

302
00:24:23,202 --> 00:24:26,796
I thought he acted on your behalf?!

303
00:24:26,909 --> 00:24:27,979
Director.

304
00:24:28,139 --> 00:24:31,441
Why would I covet that account?

305
00:24:31,564 --> 00:24:32,877
Why would you...

306
00:24:33,074 --> 00:24:36,781
I'm quite curious myself.

307
00:24:39,164 --> 00:24:43,381
Even after our kids got engaged,

308
00:24:43,688 --> 00:24:46,597
you still don't trust me?

309
00:24:56,020 --> 00:25:00,808
You're my most precious ally
and now are even family.

310
00:25:00,955 --> 00:25:04,755
How could I possibly suspect you?

311
00:25:07,311 --> 00:25:10,891
I merely was surprised to
see you get him a lawyer so fast,

312
00:25:11,185 --> 00:25:15,961
so I thought there was
something else going on.

313
00:25:18,256 --> 00:25:20,560
A lawyer?!

314
00:25:22,497 --> 00:25:26,376
Why, didn't you provide that yourself?

315
00:25:26,605 --> 00:25:30,402
That is news to me.

316
00:25:31,176 --> 00:25:32,959
Director.

317
00:25:44,523 --> 00:25:45,836
Welcome, Director.

318
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:48,916
Who assigned that
lawyer to Lee Gangmo?

319
00:25:49,994 --> 00:25:52,079
Director Min Honggi of the KCIA.

320
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:54,366
What? Min Honggi?!

321
00:25:54,451 --> 00:25:55,872
<i>Yes.</i>

322
00:25:58,451 --> 00:25:59,960
So what you're saying is,

323
00:26:00,353 --> 00:26:03,755
you didn't kill Chairman Hong,
it was Park Sotae?!

324
00:26:03,859 --> 00:26:05,935
How many times do I
have to repeat myself?

325
00:26:06,043 --> 00:26:09,039
He's not the killer, I just said
he probably knows who it is.

326
00:26:09,149 --> 00:26:10,524
You fool!

327
00:26:11,722 --> 00:26:14,263
What are you, making fun of us?

328
00:26:14,456 --> 00:26:18,511
You think we don't get you're
just trying to waste our time?

329
00:26:20,803 --> 00:26:23,148
He's as stubborn as they get.

330
00:26:27,758 --> 00:26:29,680
<i>You two can leave.</i>

331
00:26:40,311 --> 00:26:43,455
Do you have that account?

332
00:26:44,222 --> 00:26:46,518
I didn't kill Chairman Hong.

333
00:26:47,308 --> 00:26:49,231
What did Min Honggi tell you?

334
00:26:49,403 --> 00:26:51,710
I said I didn't kill him.

335
00:26:56,277 --> 00:26:58,667
Just answer my questions.

336
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:02,737
Compared to Namsan's
underground room, this is heaven.

337
00:27:02,844 --> 00:27:03,958
Speak.

338
00:27:04,047 --> 00:27:07,478
What did Min Honggi tell you
when he brought that lawyer?

339
00:27:07,675 --> 00:27:13,527
To testify in court that
Jo Pilyeon instigated me to do it.

340
00:27:14,939 --> 00:27:19,874
That if I do so, he'll reduce my
sentence to less than three years.

341
00:27:22,239 --> 00:27:24,349
Min Honggi, that son of a bitch...

342
00:27:24,729 --> 00:27:29,394
What will you do for me, then?

343
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:31,714
What?!

344
00:27:33,255 --> 00:27:35,348
If I have to rot in the can
under false accusations,

345
00:27:35,495 --> 00:27:38,706
I'd rather give that a thought.

346
00:27:38,963 --> 00:27:41,627
Be it Director Min or you,

347
00:27:41,922 --> 00:27:43,137
aren't you both from the
same, rotten mold anyway?

348
00:27:43,235 --> 00:27:45,003
You little...

349
00:27:48,436 --> 00:27:51,623
What are you, trying to blackmail me?

350
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:54,889
<i>What?! You'll testify that in court?!</i>

351
00:27:54,975 --> 00:27:57,278
Be my guest, then, you son of a bitch!

352
00:27:57,388 --> 00:27:59,627
- Don't do this!
- What's with you?

353
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:01,493
What's wrong with you?

354
00:28:03,175 --> 00:28:05,283
He's still only a suspect
who hasn't been indicted.

355
00:28:05,381 --> 00:28:06,314
So what?

356
00:28:06,412 --> 00:28:08,475
If you end up injuring him,

357
00:28:08,721 --> 00:28:11,126
things could get messy.

358
00:28:22,265 --> 00:28:24,521
So Director Min said
he'll watch your back?

359
00:28:24,767 --> 00:28:27,958
Getting people executed out of
false accusations is routine for us!

360
00:28:28,069 --> 00:28:31,813
You can kiss your freedom goodbye.

361
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:51,396
What are you doing?
Aren't you coming?

362
00:29:20,723 --> 00:29:22,525
Seonbaenim.

363
00:29:22,932 --> 00:29:25,566
I can't let this happen.

364
00:29:25,642 --> 00:29:27,069
Calm down!

365
00:29:27,192 --> 00:29:29,277
If I don't get him out of there,
it'll drive me crazy.

366
00:29:29,363 --> 00:29:31,929
We must first find the killer.

367
00:29:32,015 --> 00:29:34,200
- Until then...
- He's my brother!

368
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:36,262
And he's being exploited.

369
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:41,729
Those rotten scumbags are making him
a scapegoat for their own benefit!

370
00:29:41,824 --> 00:29:44,235
- Seonbaenim!
- Let go!

371
00:29:44,444 --> 00:29:48,372
If we look for it,
we'll find a way to help him.

372
00:30:19,322 --> 00:30:21,521
Big Oppa...

373
00:30:21,817 --> 00:30:23,787
How are you feeling?

374
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:31,789
How about Gangmo Oppa,
heard any news about him?

375
00:30:33,705 --> 00:30:36,173
You haven't had anything
to eat all day, I bet?

376
00:30:36,431 --> 00:30:39,438
Here... Have some.

377
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,535
You always liked chicken.

378
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:46,700
I have no appetite.

379
00:30:47,543 --> 00:30:50,066
You should eat and regain
your strength, you silly.

380
00:30:50,201 --> 00:30:52,459
Here... Eat.

381
00:30:52,766 --> 00:30:54,841
Let's eat, Miju.

382
00:30:58,118 --> 00:31:04,064
He won't be hurting, I hope?

383
00:31:06,077 --> 00:31:11,282
I wish he could have this.

384
00:31:13,229 --> 00:31:16,155
Will they feed him properly?

385
00:31:16,918 --> 00:31:23,608
Oppa... Can't I at least
bring him some food?

386
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:26,097
Food?

387
00:31:26,484 --> 00:31:27,724
Yeah...

388
00:31:27,908 --> 00:31:34,328
Just some rice soup,
to keep his mood up.

389
00:31:46,016 --> 00:31:49,957
It's always a pleasure to witness
beards like yours, Hyungnim.

390
00:31:50,055 --> 00:31:52,117
Is that so?

391
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:56,473
Can't we get our hands on a mirror?

392
00:31:56,568 --> 00:32:01,762
<i>Ahh... Really, haven't seen this
masterpiece in so long, it's killing me!</i>

393
00:32:04,828 --> 00:32:06,488
Lee Gangmo.

394
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:09,427
You have visitors.
Come out.

395
00:32:19,603 --> 00:32:21,279
Miju!

396
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:23,727
Oppa...

397
00:32:25,393 --> 00:32:29,268
You don't look well.

398
00:32:30,094 --> 00:32:32,488
This place is better than it looks.

399
00:32:33,703 --> 00:32:38,066
I'll soon be out,
so don't you worry.

400
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:41,037
All right, Oppa.

401
00:32:54,995 --> 00:32:56,960
It's time.

402
00:32:57,641 --> 00:33:01,203
Oppa... I brought you some food.

403
00:33:01,324 --> 00:33:03,932
You must finish it all, got it?

404
00:33:04,025 --> 00:33:05,930
They're feeding me well here.

405
00:33:06,225 --> 00:33:08,668
You take good care of yourself.

406
00:33:09,257 --> 00:33:13,873
Anyway, you must eat it.
Are we clear, Oppa?

407
00:33:13,995 --> 00:33:15,956
All right.

408
00:33:17,935 --> 00:33:19,466
Let's go.

409
00:33:19,797 --> 00:33:20,945
Miju.

410
00:33:21,101 --> 00:33:22,734
Oppa...

411
00:33:22,869 --> 00:33:24,526
Don't cry.

412
00:33:24,648 --> 00:33:26,858
Don't you cry.

413
00:33:27,497 --> 00:33:29,117
<i>That's what worries me the most,</i>

414
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,547
you crying because of me.

415
00:33:31,974 --> 00:33:33,229
I won't cry.

416
00:33:33,413 --> 00:33:35,034
I'm not going to.

417
00:33:35,132 --> 00:33:37,796
Same goes for you, Oppa.

418
00:33:42,941 --> 00:33:45,672
Oppa. Finish it all.

419
00:33:45,771 --> 00:33:48,582
You must eat it all.

420
00:33:51,397 --> 00:33:53,148
Oppa...

421
00:33:53,443 --> 00:33:56,044
Little Oppa...

422
00:34:11,943 --> 00:34:13,157
What's with you?

423
00:34:13,268 --> 00:34:15,994
I... I'm sorry.

424
00:34:18,891 --> 00:34:20,364
Wipe it.

425
00:34:20,927 --> 00:34:21,727
Excuse me?

426
00:34:21,837 --> 00:34:23,777
Can't you see what you did?

427
00:34:31,147 --> 00:34:32,554
Ahh... Really...

428
00:34:32,645 --> 00:34:34,866
You made it worse!

429
00:34:36,426 --> 00:34:37,921
I apologize.

430
00:34:38,069 --> 00:34:41,125
I'll pay for dry cleaning.

431
00:34:49,018 --> 00:34:52,073
This is all I have at the moment,

432
00:34:52,208 --> 00:34:53,779
but if you leave me your number,

433
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:55,965
- I'll...
- Forget it.

434
00:34:58,254 --> 00:35:00,703
Just my lucky day, really...

435
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:04,637
I'm sorry.

436
00:35:17,347 --> 00:35:19,693
Did you tell Gangmo?

437
00:35:20,405 --> 00:35:21,412
Yeah.

438
00:35:21,571 --> 00:35:24,812
To finish all of it.

439
00:35:25,712 --> 00:35:28,163
You kept quiet about me, right?

440
00:35:30,456 --> 00:35:35,993
He would have been
happy to hear I met you...

441
00:35:39,332 --> 00:35:41,260
Let's wait it out a little longer.

442
00:35:41,371 --> 00:35:46,177
We must be careful
until Gangmo is released.

443
00:35:46,649 --> 00:35:51,989
But he didn't look too well.

444
00:36:08,634 --> 00:36:12,043
I was called by Director Jo.

445
00:36:12,185 --> 00:36:14,829
Was just wondering if there was
any progress in your investigation.

446
00:36:14,931 --> 00:36:17,364
Are you certain
Lee Gangmo is the culprit?

447
00:36:17,457 --> 00:36:21,096
That is all we can deduce
from the available evidence.

448
00:36:23,138 --> 00:36:25,852
So is there no possibility whatsoever?

449
00:36:26,024 --> 00:36:29,216
Of Lee Gangmo being innocent, that is.

450
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,358
This is top secret information,

451
00:36:32,518 --> 00:36:37,330
but we found bloodstains
on the murder weapon.

452
00:36:38,003 --> 00:36:39,918
Was it Lee Gangmo's blood?

453
00:36:40,124 --> 00:36:41,612
No.

454
00:36:41,857 --> 00:36:44,362
And neither was it Chairman Hong's.

455
00:36:45,427 --> 00:36:46,915
Then?

456
00:36:47,296 --> 00:36:49,751
Are we dealing with a third person?

457
00:36:49,923 --> 00:36:54,372
That's possible, but it
could just be an accomplice.

458
00:36:55,708 --> 00:36:59,209
If this is revealed, it will
put us in a difficult position,

459
00:36:59,344 --> 00:37:01,333
so we're restricting this
to private inquiries.

460
00:37:01,468 --> 00:37:04,917
And if the man matching those
bloodstains is not found,

461
00:37:05,003 --> 00:37:07,241
what will happen?

462
00:37:07,488 --> 00:37:11,007
We'll have to indict
Lee Gangmo, naturally.

463
00:37:11,449 --> 00:37:14,150
<i>Allow me to meet him just a moment.</i>

464
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:18,839
I said visiting hours are over already.

465
00:37:18,999 --> 00:37:21,057
<i>I'll just see his face
and leave right away.</i>

466
00:37:21,094 --> 00:37:24,691
Ahh... You really refuse to listen.

467
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:27,379
What is the matter?

468
00:37:28,156 --> 00:37:31,185
This lady keeps insisting
to meet Lee Gangmo...

469
00:37:31,305 --> 00:37:34,374
Then, at least convey him a letter.

470
00:37:34,509 --> 00:37:36,903
<i>That should be all right, I hope?</i>

471
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:04,373
And they went for us! 3 vs 13.
Of course we were the three.

472
00:38:04,508 --> 00:38:08,280
And what would you think
in such a risky situation?

473
00:38:08,449 --> 00:38:13,272
You'd just charge and
put your life on the line!

474
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:18,391
<i>Gangmo.</i>

475
00:38:18,514 --> 00:38:20,797
<i>I believe you.</i>

476
00:38:21,153 --> 00:38:25,519
<i>I'll prove your innocence at all cost.</i>

477
00:38:26,339 --> 00:38:33,228
<i>Whoever framed you for this will pay,
even if it ends up being Jeongshik.</i>

478
00:38:34,887 --> 00:38:39,219
<i>I'll find that Park Sotae.</i>

479
00:38:40,367 --> 00:38:45,430
<i>Don't be discouraged, Gangmo.
I'm here for you.</i>

480
00:38:46,146 --> 00:38:47,659
<i>Got it, Gangmo?</i>

481
00:38:47,781 --> 00:38:49,304
<i>~ Jeongyeon ~</i>

482
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:54,926
Jeongyeon...

483
00:39:16,867 --> 00:39:19,707
Oppa! You're so cool!

484
00:39:19,805 --> 00:39:23,930
Give me a fucking break.
Cool, my ass... Hey, you bitches!

485
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:25,477
Do you like money that much?

486
00:39:25,587 --> 00:39:28,570
Does it make you go crazy?

487
00:39:28,779 --> 00:39:31,123
Of course we like it, Oppa!

488
00:39:31,221 --> 00:39:32,498
Oppa...

489
00:39:32,584 --> 00:39:34,708
What line of work are you in,
to make so much money?

490
00:39:34,818 --> 00:39:39,330
Me?! What else, a thief...
No, wait. A conman.

491
00:39:39,459 --> 00:39:41,533
A conman?

492
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,647
The kind who would
sell out a friend, why?

493
00:39:45,807 --> 00:39:48,949
Must have been worth
quite the money, then?

494
00:39:49,146 --> 00:39:53,246
I wish I had someone
to sell off like you...

495
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:58,144
What did you just say?

496
00:39:58,402 --> 00:40:00,575
I asked you a question.

497
00:40:00,685 --> 00:40:01,483
Out.

498
00:40:01,594 --> 00:40:03,228
Oppa, what's wrong?

499
00:40:03,305 --> 00:40:07,204
Oppa, my ass...
Get the hell out!

500
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:28,672
Lee Gangmo.

501
00:40:30,004 --> 00:40:32,558
Don't resent me too much.

502
00:40:33,685 --> 00:40:36,597
This is what I've always been.

503
00:40:38,157 --> 00:40:43,870
The kind of man who would
do anything for the right price.

504
00:40:47,762 --> 00:40:54,156
The kind of man who would get
on all fours for a little money.

505
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:05,286
You're a fool for ever
thinking of me as a friend.

506
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:10,896
Would you have taken
responsibility for me? Uh?!

507
00:41:11,031 --> 00:41:17,427
This is what Park Sotae
has always been about.

508
00:41:17,607 --> 00:41:20,026
A son of a bitch, nothing more.

509
00:41:22,174 --> 00:41:25,722
That's what I've always been.

510
00:41:27,595 --> 00:41:29,294
That is...

511
00:41:29,478 --> 00:41:33,879
That is what I am!

512
00:41:46,473 --> 00:41:49,266
I've been looking for you all day long.

513
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:05,173
Ever considered the possibility
that Lee Gangmo might be lying to you?

514
00:42:09,347 --> 00:42:14,680
Everyone but you thinks he's guilty.

515
00:42:17,921 --> 00:42:20,020
Aren't you listening?

516
00:42:22,488 --> 00:42:24,955
Will you leave me alone?

517
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:34,117
All I'm thinking of right now
is how to get Gangmo out of prison.

518
00:42:34,817 --> 00:42:38,316
All that populates your
thoughts is Lee Gangmo?

519
00:42:39,887 --> 00:42:41,575
So, what,

520
00:42:42,495 --> 00:42:45,822
you're not thinking
about me in the slightest?

521
00:42:46,595 --> 00:42:48,952
Should I?

522
00:42:52,941 --> 00:42:54,701
Fine.

523
00:42:55,444 --> 00:42:58,193
Fine with me, just fine.

524
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:02,478
But don't cry for
another man in my presence.

525
00:43:03,768 --> 00:43:05,969
I can tolerate everything else,

526
00:43:06,836 --> 00:43:09,668
but I'm afraid that crosses the line.

527
00:43:17,295 --> 00:43:19,639
Go in, you must be tired.

528
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:37,043
Ohh... Minwoo.

529
00:43:38,429 --> 00:43:41,551
Did you drink?

530
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:44,107
Yes... A little.

531
00:43:44,232 --> 00:43:45,844
I'll go to my room.

532
00:43:46,089 --> 00:43:47,661
Listen.

533
00:43:48,397 --> 00:43:52,840
Is Jeongyeon making things hard for you?

534
00:43:53,012 --> 00:43:54,240
Nothing of that sort.

535
00:43:54,362 --> 00:43:55,934
<i>Really?! Don't lie to me.</i>

536
00:43:56,130 --> 00:43:59,469
Think I wouldn't realize you're
having it hard because of her?

537
00:43:59,592 --> 00:44:00,882
I said it's not that.

538
00:44:00,955 --> 00:44:04,429
- I'll meet Jeongyeon tomorrow, and...
- I said don't!

539
00:44:04,552 --> 00:44:06,405
Are you starting as well?

540
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,934
Hey... Minwoo.

541
00:44:09,646 --> 00:44:13,857
Just let me deal with this. Please.

542
00:44:16,464 --> 00:44:17,957
Hey.

543
00:44:29,349 --> 00:44:37,634
<i>{\a6}~ Lost Birds of Passage ~
(by Choi Heejun)</i>

544
00:44:29,349 --> 00:44:37,634
There must be a reason,

545
00:44:37,756 --> 00:44:45,951
An explanation for what happened,

546
00:44:46,134 --> 00:45:01,685
For those migratory birds
who lost their way.

547
00:45:12,564 --> 00:45:14,292
<i>Expelled?</i>

548
00:45:14,407 --> 00:45:17,695
Are you telling me the government will
put pressure on the construction sector?

549
00:45:17,818 --> 00:45:23,600
As you're well aware, the real estate
sector is scraping the bottom,

550
00:45:23,781 --> 00:45:26,035
not to mention the
succession of unsold apartments.

551
00:45:26,157 --> 00:45:28,893
So what's the standard here?

552
00:45:29,021 --> 00:45:33,277
What will their decision
be based on, just a whim?

553
00:45:33,527 --> 00:45:38,298
The company's finances and
their credit rating, I suppose?

554
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:44,329
Can't we learn the list of
these businesses getting the boot?

555
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:47,042
It's top secret, obviously.

556
00:45:47,202 --> 00:45:50,173
But what are you concerned about?

557
00:45:50,276 --> 00:45:52,603
If you successfully complete
the subway construction,

558
00:45:52,726 --> 00:45:56,462
isn't it just a matter of time
before you reach the top of your sector?

559
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:01,290
Our country's economy
is facing a crisis,

560
00:46:01,389 --> 00:46:03,891
could I start dancing in
jubilation all by myself?

561
00:46:04,099 --> 00:46:09,697
Anyhow, we hope you'll
keep our committee in mind.

562
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:12,213
If you'll excuse me...

563
00:46:17,186 --> 00:46:18,989
Commissioner.

564
00:46:19,149 --> 00:46:22,865
Are any of the committee
members part of that list?

565
00:46:23,024 --> 00:46:24,669
Well...

566
00:46:28,352 --> 00:46:33,287
There will be a rise in
companies filing for bankruptcy.

567
00:46:33,422 --> 00:46:35,659
Shouldn't we find a solution ourselves?

568
00:46:35,769 --> 00:46:37,770
Of course.

569
00:46:44,890 --> 00:46:51,131
Baekpa and Congressman Oh Byeongtak
are in the VIP room.

570
00:46:53,814 --> 00:46:56,544
Is it the kind of meeting
I can interrupt?

571
00:46:57,643 --> 00:47:02,066
If I were you, I wouldn't
lose this opportunity.

572
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:12,836
I don't know how long it's been
since we've met this way, Hyungnim.

573
00:47:12,922 --> 00:47:14,702
Just speak plainly with me.

574
00:47:14,837 --> 00:47:18,397
That's too much reverence for
a mere private lender like myself.

575
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:22,659
What are you saying?
If it weren't for you,

576
00:47:22,774 --> 00:47:26,696
how could today's
Oh Byeongtak even exist?

577
00:47:27,190 --> 00:47:28,966
<i>Here, let's drink.</i>

578
00:47:29,885 --> 00:47:32,181
Come on in.

579
00:47:37,484 --> 00:47:40,234
What brings you here, Chairman Hwang?

580
00:47:43,906 --> 00:47:46,239
I apologize for the sudden intrusion.

581
00:47:46,768 --> 00:47:48,938
May I sit?

582
00:47:49,029 --> 00:47:51,640
It'd certainly be all right with me,

583
00:47:51,787 --> 00:47:57,676
but this gentleman here is
not one to favor the mundane.

584
00:47:59,763 --> 00:48:06,343
I've heard you were here,
so I couldn't just leave.

585
00:48:06,490 --> 00:48:11,558
I tend to sleep early,
so I'll have to get going.

586
00:48:12,417 --> 00:48:15,081
Buses are still running, right?

587
00:48:22,716 --> 00:48:25,136
I might be an ignorant fool,

588
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:30,390
but I'm well aware that nobody
can succeed in this business...

589
00:48:30,648 --> 00:48:32,317
without you two gentlemen's help.

590
00:48:32,428 --> 00:48:35,184
Chairman Hwang.
What's wrong with you?

591
00:48:35,595 --> 00:48:39,379
I'm just looking for your support.

592
00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:43,466
Once the subway
construction is complete,

593
00:48:43,651 --> 00:48:49,774
I'll turn all that land in Gangnam
into a new world of opportunity.

594
00:48:50,206 --> 00:48:53,209
<i>All I'm asking
is for some support, Sir.</i>

595
00:49:11,761 --> 00:49:13,797
Good shot!

596
00:49:15,390 --> 00:49:18,120
Still can go at it, I see.

597
00:49:24,025 --> 00:49:27,013
Seems like the police
are following another lead.

598
00:49:27,110 --> 00:49:28,407
Really?

599
00:49:28,594 --> 00:49:32,041
I hear they found different
bloodstains on the murder scene.

600
00:49:44,973 --> 00:49:48,499
So did they find out
who that blood belongs to?

601
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,230
Not yet,

602
00:49:50,365 --> 00:49:53,078
but since they're going to investigate
the scene again, they'll soon find out.

603
00:49:57,252 --> 00:50:00,765
You went to meet
Chairman Hong that day, right?

604
00:50:02,746 --> 00:50:06,288
Did Jeongyeon tell you that?
That I went there.

605
00:50:07,916 --> 00:50:10,174
Why are you getting all agitated?

606
00:50:12,357 --> 00:50:15,242
Ruin the mood, will you?

607
00:50:22,607 --> 00:50:25,009
Ahh... That feels good.

608
00:50:31,285 --> 00:50:33,112
Why are you staring at me that way?

609
00:50:33,326 --> 00:50:36,966
Did my badmouthing Jeongyeon upset you?

610
00:50:39,144 --> 00:50:41,113
Let's save golf for tomorrow.

611
00:50:41,186 --> 00:50:43,703
Today's just not my day.

612
00:50:43,948 --> 00:50:45,937
I'll get going.

613
00:51:07,593 --> 00:51:13,447
<i>For my sake, Gangmo will risk
his life without blinking once!</i>

614
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:18,466
<i>He's a hundred, a thousand
times better than you!</i>

615
00:51:19,990 --> 00:51:24,251
Is there really such a way?

616
00:51:24,778 --> 00:51:28,387
If we get our hands on the copy
of Chairman Hong's account,

617
00:51:28,496 --> 00:51:33,767
we can kill off Min Honggi's candidacy
at the by-elections free of any expense.

618
00:51:36,265 --> 00:51:38,840
Ahh... Could it get
more tangled than this?!

619
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:44,009
With this, Dad would finally start
acknowledging me more than Gangmo.

620
00:51:46,749 --> 00:51:48,563
Wait...

621
00:51:50,085 --> 00:51:55,174
Did I leave anything behind
at Chairman Hong's cottage?

622
00:51:56,860 --> 00:51:59,372
Ahh... I'll be damned.

623
00:52:00,084 --> 00:52:02,416
What now?

624
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:11,023
It'll take about an hour to get there.

625
00:52:11,121 --> 00:52:13,650
Looks like you didn't
close an eye last night,

626
00:52:13,822 --> 00:52:15,553
so sleep on the way.

627
00:52:16,014 --> 00:52:17,403
No need.

628
00:52:17,538 --> 00:52:19,293
I wouldn't catch sleep.

629
00:52:22,035 --> 00:52:25,971
Never imagined Lee Gangmo
could mean so much to you.

630
00:52:26,372 --> 00:52:30,047
Enough to rob you of
your sleep and appetite.

631
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:33,143
First you force me to
go there against my will,

632
00:52:33,252 --> 00:52:35,031
and now what, trying to rile me up?

633
00:52:35,497 --> 00:52:37,597
Pull aside right now.

634
00:52:38,689 --> 00:52:40,936
Now that's my Jeongyeon.

635
00:52:41,753 --> 00:52:42,782
What?!

636
00:52:42,881 --> 00:52:47,561
All fierce and grumpy,
that's your charm.

637
00:52:50,025 --> 00:52:54,361
Looking so dejected,
it just doesn't feel like you.

638
00:52:54,570 --> 00:52:56,571
And I don't like that.

639
00:54:40,115 --> 00:54:41,048
It's you?!

640
00:54:41,146 --> 00:54:42,362
Was it you?

641
00:54:42,472 --> 00:54:44,964
- Minwoo... It's not that...
- Minwoo!

642
00:54:45,025 --> 00:54:47,088
<i>Jo Minwoo!</i>

643
00:54:52,678 --> 00:54:53,921
Run.

644
00:54:56,279 --> 00:54:58,211
I said run!

645
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:08,185
How about that man?

646
00:55:11,401 --> 00:55:12,604
I lost him.

647
00:55:12,844 --> 00:55:14,814
Have you seen his face?

648
00:55:17,779 --> 00:55:20,210
Have you seen that man's face or not?

649
00:55:20,492 --> 00:55:23,438
No... I couldn't.

650
00:55:24,494 --> 00:55:28,005
Was it Jeongshik, by any chance?

651
00:55:28,273 --> 00:55:31,199
Think I wouldn't even recognize him?

652
00:55:32,827 --> 00:55:34,636
You've seen now, haven't you?

653
00:55:34,968 --> 00:55:38,116
Someone else was behind that murder.

654
00:55:38,245 --> 00:55:40,001
It wasn't Gangmo.

655
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:42,039
It could just be an accomplice.

656
00:55:42,112 --> 00:55:44,448
Of Gangmo's.

657
00:56:11,175 --> 00:56:12,365
Minwoo...

658
00:56:12,537 --> 00:56:15,524
The reason I went to
Chairman Hong's cottage...

659
00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:21,253
The blood they found on that stoker...

660
00:56:21,830 --> 00:56:25,354
Should I head to the police right now
and find out who it belongs to?

661
00:56:25,508 --> 00:56:28,264
M...Minwoo...

662
00:56:28,426 --> 00:56:31,198
Confess the truth just to me.

663
00:56:31,529 --> 00:56:32,916
It was you.

664
00:56:33,141 --> 00:56:34,979
You killed him, right?

665
00:56:37,299 --> 00:56:39,298
It was an accident.

666
00:56:42,044 --> 00:56:44,810
Chairman Hong attacked me first,

667
00:56:44,933 --> 00:56:47,437
and I just pushed him a little...

668
00:56:50,501 --> 00:56:52,825
What did you do with the account?

669
00:56:54,743 --> 00:56:57,392
Where did you put
Chairman Hong's account?

670
00:56:59,614 --> 00:57:03,935
I set it on fire.
I was too scared.

671
00:57:05,921 --> 00:57:06,879
Minwoo.

672
00:57:06,977 --> 00:57:08,652
What can I do now?

673
00:57:08,794 --> 00:57:11,617
Should I just escape abroad?

674
00:57:12,648 --> 00:57:15,324
Tell them that, on the day
Chairman Hong was killed,

675
00:57:17,637 --> 00:57:19,883
you were with me.

676
00:57:20,679 --> 00:57:21,819
Uh?!

677
00:57:21,911 --> 00:57:25,531
You never met him.
You did leave to meet him,

678
00:57:25,629 --> 00:57:27,884
but met me on the way,
and we went out for drinks together.

679
00:57:28,007 --> 00:57:34,217
But... How about the bloodstains?
Gangmo must be aware I met Chairman Hong.

680
00:57:34,536 --> 00:57:36,525
Leave all that to me.

681
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:38,661
If your alibi is strong enough,

682
00:57:39,218 --> 00:57:41,877
then they won't
even start investigating.

683
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:44,651
Thanks, Minwoo.

684
00:57:44,835 --> 00:57:47,018
You're a true friend.

685
00:57:47,128 --> 00:57:50,044
One day, I'll make it up to you.

686
00:57:50,154 --> 00:57:51,870
Thanks, Minwoo...

687
00:57:54,997 --> 00:57:57,342
Thanks...

688
00:58:00,465 --> 00:58:01,751
Now that you mention it,

689
00:58:01,861 --> 00:58:05,317
Lee Gangmo kept mentioning
Hwang Jeongshik this, Park Sotae that,

690
00:58:05,456 --> 00:58:09,248
so we were about to
call you in for questioning.

691
00:58:09,388 --> 00:58:11,179
Nasty prick...

692
00:58:11,375 --> 00:58:15,771
Gangmo and I have never
really seen eye to eye.

693
00:58:17,208 --> 00:58:21,516
Anyhow, when your alibi is confirmed
by someone as trustworthy as Chief Jo,

694
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:24,223
I see no need to
investigate any further.

695
00:58:24,442 --> 00:58:28,683
By the way, is Lee Gangmo
still refusing any confession?

696
00:58:28,929 --> 00:58:30,438
We'll have to wrap that up soon.

697
00:58:30,561 --> 00:58:34,541
We can write that
deposition for him, anyway.

698
00:58:45,881 --> 00:58:48,821
<i>So you're not going
to give up, are you?</i>

699
00:58:49,344 --> 00:58:51,878
What were you writing?

700
00:58:53,597 --> 00:58:54,542
Uh?

701
00:58:54,710 --> 00:58:56,441
Did you find Park Sotae?

702
00:58:56,519 --> 00:58:59,700
Park Sotae is nowhere to be found!

703
00:59:00,731 --> 00:59:02,953
Stop trying to waste our time,

704
00:59:03,166 --> 00:59:05,617
and just confess that you
killed him while you still can.

705
00:59:05,802 --> 00:59:07,593
<i>Is that clear?</i>

706
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:16,253
And mine?

707
00:59:16,389 --> 00:59:17,628
Haven't had lunch yet?

708
00:59:17,751 --> 00:59:19,850
Ahh... How can you...

709
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:22,634
I'm starving in here.

710
00:59:22,982 --> 00:59:26,054
I'll be right back,
so hurry up and eat.

711
00:59:35,298 --> 00:59:36,538
<i>Oppa.</i>

712
00:59:36,648 --> 00:59:38,957
<i>I brought you some food.</i>

713
00:59:39,067 --> 00:59:42,350
<i>You must finish it all.
Are we clear?</i>

714
01:00:14,685 --> 01:00:17,249
<i>Any emergency can get
you out of detention.</i>

715
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:20,056
<i>Just get out of there, for starters.</i>

716
01:00:41,486 --> 01:00:44,252
<i>Just the sole thought
would make me lose sleep.</i>

717
01:00:44,355 --> 01:00:47,444
<i>So I haven't slept eight hours
straight since I've been here.</i>

718
01:00:47,990 --> 01:00:49,832
Any questions so far?

719
01:00:49,955 --> 01:00:51,182
No questions.

720
01:00:51,256 --> 01:00:54,969
Yeah... There are times when
it's better to have none, indeed.

721
01:00:56,212 --> 01:00:58,347
Hey... Kiddo.

722
01:00:58,615 --> 01:01:01,968
<i>From what I hear, you're,
like, some killer and stuff?</i>

723
01:01:02,165 --> 01:01:03,621
You!

724
01:01:03,716 --> 01:01:05,062
The hell are you staring at?

725
01:01:05,195 --> 01:01:07,368
Do you even know
who he is, you little...

726
01:01:07,417 --> 01:01:10,977
Forget it, as if I was that famous.

727
01:01:11,137 --> 01:01:14,048
Listen. By any chance,

728
01:01:14,153 --> 01:01:18,052
ever heard of White Beard
from Wangshim-Ri?

729
01:01:20,037 --> 01:01:22,762
Seeing how your beard
doesn't even scare him,

730
01:01:22,848 --> 01:01:24,125
must be still wet behind the ears.

731
01:01:24,223 --> 01:01:26,826
Do you expect him to know everyone?

732
01:01:26,912 --> 01:01:30,007
Will you come here and introduce
yourself or what? You s...

733
01:01:30,392 --> 01:01:32,713
<i>Looks like quite the
promising kiddo, actually.</i>

734
01:01:32,885 --> 01:01:36,408
Aigoo... Ohh my!

735
01:01:36,580 --> 01:01:38,397
You look nice.

736
01:01:38,532 --> 01:01:40,693
I see fire in those eyes.

737
01:01:40,779 --> 01:01:43,013
Sit down.

738
01:01:47,431 --> 01:01:48,916
Kiddo.

739
01:01:49,628 --> 01:01:52,046
So who did you kill on your way here?

740
01:01:53,691 --> 01:01:55,326
Boys.

741
01:01:55,431 --> 01:02:00,036
If you're going to get time in the can,
do it like him, show some balls.

742
01:02:00,110 --> 01:02:06,371
Forget all those petty charges, go for
the kill or it's useless, are we clear?

743
01:02:08,899 --> 01:02:10,864
So what's your name?

744
01:02:12,999 --> 01:02:14,621
Your name.

745
01:02:14,711 --> 01:02:16,927
Didn't your old folks give you one?

746
01:02:17,644 --> 01:02:20,168
The hell does he have, some handicap?

747
01:02:22,979 --> 01:02:25,999
What did you just do to me?

748
01:02:26,430 --> 01:02:29,745
You little prick, how dare you!

749
01:02:29,818 --> 01:02:34,704
The hell are you waiting for?
Teach him a lesson, you scamps!

750
01:02:35,495 --> 01:02:40,197
How dare you...

751
01:03:26,272 --> 01:03:29,815
Hey! What's wrong with you, again?

752
01:03:31,798 --> 01:03:33,427
You motherless little scamp...

753
01:03:33,513 --> 01:03:36,852
- Hold him!
- Hold him.

754
01:03:38,285 --> 01:03:40,669
Do you have a death wish?

755
01:03:40,854 --> 01:03:44,094
Let's shut that trap for good.

756
01:03:49,685 --> 01:03:57,235
You dare continue to pluck
White Beard's claim to fame?

757
01:04:10,892 --> 01:04:12,323
Hey.

758
01:04:12,434 --> 01:04:15,238
Do you have some kind of
lifelong grudge against facial hair?

759
01:04:16,314 --> 01:04:18,147
Forget everything else,

760
01:04:18,294 --> 01:04:21,548
but I can't tolerate people
messing with my beard.

761
01:04:23,119 --> 01:04:25,821
Right...
You must be sorry?!

762
01:04:25,932 --> 01:04:31,812
You were indicted for murder,
so I tried to be lenient, you know?

763
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:38,139
Where did this prick come out of?

764
01:04:38,281 --> 01:04:40,573
He's scary!

765
01:04:56,344 --> 01:04:57,375
What the hell happened?

766
01:04:57,448 --> 01:05:00,984
- Seems like they beat him up.
- They did what?

767
01:05:07,918 --> 01:05:11,460
Those damned thugs...

768
01:05:13,758 --> 01:05:18,580
We'll even have to change
our gang's name now.

769
01:05:19,464 --> 01:05:21,959
Calling ourselves
the White Beard Gang...

770
01:05:22,279 --> 01:05:24,857
would be going a little
overboard, don't you think?

771
01:05:27,937 --> 01:05:30,749
Hyungnim!

772

<i>~ For Authorized Personnel Only ~</i>

773
01:06:02,708 --> 01:06:04,095
<i>How is his condition?</i>

774
01:06:04,181 --> 01:06:06,771
Other than a cracked rib,
no major injuries.

775
01:06:06,857 --> 01:06:10,307
We'll keep him under observation for the
night, so you can come for him tomorrow.

776
01:06:49,944 --> 01:06:51,901
- Let me ask you something.
- Yes.

777

<i>The name of the patient here...</i>

778
01:06:59,913 --> 01:07:01,345
Who the hell are you?

779
01:07:01,443 --> 01:07:03,727
Let me go!

780
01:07:11,572 --> 01:07:12,626
Who are you?

781
01:07:12,699 --> 01:07:16,026
There's no time. Get moving!

782
01:07:34,337 --> 01:07:36,287
Excuse me.

783
01:07:45,814 --> 01:07:47,656
What happened?

784
01:07:47,753 --> 01:07:51,586
Go and get him...
Go get Lee Gangmo!

785
01:07:55,694 --> 01:07:57,499
Thank you.

786
01:07:58,014 --> 01:08:00,457
But who are you, to help me...

787
01:08:13,461 --> 01:08:15,265
Stop the car.

~ On The Next Episode Of ~

794
01:08:30,292 --> 01:08:34,272
On the day Chairman Hong was killed,
Jeongshik went to his cottage.

795
01:08:34,407 --> 01:08:36,224
<i>That account must be in his hands.</i>

796
01:08:36,310 --> 01:08:37,967
<i>There is a ship heading for Hong Kong.</i>

797
01:08:38,065 --> 01:08:40,459
I'll find you a spot there,
so get prepared.

798
01:08:40,570 --> 01:08:45,247
Go search around the pier. Lee Gangmo
will surely try to smuggle himself out.

799
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:48,251
Even those you're waiting for
must be anxious.

800
01:08:48,361 --> 01:08:49,908
What are you, trying to rile me up?

801
01:08:49,982 --> 01:08:51,222
This is what you
were looking for, right?

802
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:54,192
Why do you have this?

803
01:08:54,438 --> 01:08:57,949
This is where Gangmo is, right?
He's hiding here, right?

804
01:08:58,044 --> 01:08:59,839
- Go.
- No way!

805
01:08:59,901 --> 01:09:02,513
- You really...
- I missed you, Gangmo.
