Episode 57

4
00:00:09,169 --> 00:00:11,672
Seeing these autumn leaves,

5
00:00:12,157 --> 00:00:16,737
I get the feeling that growing
old is not that bad after all.

6
00:00:19,544 --> 00:00:22,732
I guess it's newfound
passion for one's final days.

7
00:00:33,007 --> 00:00:34,609
Right...

8
00:00:35,025 --> 00:00:36,515
Well said.

9
00:00:37,462 --> 00:00:42,003
Then, they fall to the ground.

10
00:00:44,243 --> 00:00:46,456
And die.

11
00:01:03,089 --> 00:01:06,772
Youngguk....

12
00:01:06,965 --> 00:01:11,117
Are.... Are you still with me?

13
00:01:11,262 --> 00:01:13,809
Don't you worry.

14
00:01:13,998 --> 00:01:17,965
This is nothing.

15
00:01:19,951 --> 00:01:26,559
Back in the day, you
were a gangster in Myeongdong...

16
00:01:26,734 --> 00:01:30,226
You can't let this bring you down.

17
00:01:56,661 --> 00:01:58,393
Write it down.

18
00:01:59,033 --> 00:02:01,973
Write what?

19
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:04,551
If you want to get
out of here alive, do it!

20
00:02:04,688 --> 00:02:08,016
I... I don't know a thing!

21
00:02:08,122 --> 00:02:10,637
You really want to die?

22
00:02:10,742 --> 00:02:13,362
I know nothing.

23
00:02:22,647 --> 00:02:25,893
Is it true that the chairman
was arrested by the ANSP?

24
00:02:26,332 --> 00:02:29,323
Don't get involved in this.

25
00:02:29,513 --> 00:02:30,983
What is that supposed to mean?

26
00:02:31,128 --> 00:02:33,035
It's what Dad wanted me to do.

27
00:02:33,206 --> 00:02:37,794
To stop you from getting involved,
in case anything like this happened.

28
00:02:38,073 --> 00:02:42,553
Because if things go wrong, you
and your brother could be in danger.

29
00:02:45,977 --> 00:02:47,898
Who are you calling?

30
00:02:48,151 --> 00:02:50,573
Arresting the chairman is nothing
but a subterfuge by Jo Pilyeon.

31
00:02:50,665 --> 00:02:51,707
Gangmo...

32
00:02:51,803 --> 00:02:57,358
If anything happens to the
chairman, we'll all be in danger anyway.

33
00:03:17,334 --> 00:03:19,016
It's me, Hyung.

34
00:03:20,777 --> 00:03:22,175
What's the matter?

35
00:03:22,295 --> 00:03:25,434
Chairman Hwang
was arrested by the ANSP.

36
00:03:27,282 --> 00:03:29,382
Tell me what happened.

37
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,815
You're back, Chief?

38
00:03:32,906 --> 00:03:37,635
Ohh... Sure.
I'll see you there, then.

39
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:40,793
What brings you here, Sir?

40
00:03:40,663 --> 00:03:42,176
{\a6}- Hwang Taeseop Investigation File -

41
00:03:41,725 --> 00:03:45,112
You know Hwang Taeseop has
been arrested, right?

42
00:03:45,436 --> 00:03:46,267
Really?

43
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:50,028
I think you'll have to
be the one who questions him.

44
00:03:50,421 --> 00:03:51,309
What was he brought in for?

45
00:03:51,411 --> 00:03:56,311
The man responsible for leaking the recent
torture case to the press was Hwang Taeseop.

46
00:03:56,421 --> 00:04:02,104
Find out who he got that
information from, and how.

47
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,337
I'll have to take a look
at the case files first, then.

48
00:04:17,449 --> 00:04:22,183
So you're telling me you have clear
evidence that Lee Seongmo betrayed you?

49
00:04:25,938 --> 00:04:30,071
Here's a photo of him and Hwang Taeseop.

50
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,353
I see.

51
00:04:38,697 --> 00:04:41,336
This is Lee Seongmo for sure.

52
00:05:07,386 --> 00:05:10,569
You've recently been to the
Myeongdong Cathedral, right?

53
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:15,548
Was this the day?

54
00:05:17,993 --> 00:05:20,744
We're under surveillance.

55
00:05:29,153 --> 00:05:34,509
I don't really remember.

56
00:05:40,097 --> 00:05:42,680
You know Yoo Chanseong, right?

57
00:05:43,067 --> 00:05:48,021
Have you ever received
any account from him?

58
00:05:53,697 --> 00:05:59,069
Why don't you just kill me?

59
00:06:00,347 --> 00:06:04,189
If a little torture could scare me,

60
00:06:05,674 --> 00:06:10,302
I wouldn't even have started all this.

61
00:06:11,524 --> 00:06:13,546
So you're acknowledging those allegations.

62
00:06:13,675 --> 00:06:19,580
After going to hell and back,

63
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:23,306
every day I live is a gift.

64
00:06:24,878 --> 00:06:31,786
If going through
all this can help me...

65
00:06:32,245 --> 00:06:41,231
gain the right to ask my
late friend for forgiveness,

66
00:06:42,322 --> 00:06:44,098
then, sure...

67
00:06:44,978 --> 00:06:50,108
I would finally be able to die in peace.

68
00:06:55,287 --> 00:06:58,389
What the hell is he talking about?

69
00:07:00,714 --> 00:07:05,152
If you keep this up, you'll force
us to take you back to the underground bunker.

70
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:07,248
Answer.

71
00:07:08,165 --> 00:07:13,506
Have you ever received any
account from Yoo Chanseong?

72
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:16,708
If I do answer,

73
00:07:17,726 --> 00:07:21,781
will you do me a favor?

74
00:07:27,297 --> 00:07:32,682
If I die here,

75
00:07:33,569 --> 00:07:36,171
I would like you...

76
00:07:36,845 --> 00:07:43,491
to convey these words to my daughter.

77
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:52,622
Marry the man you love.

78
00:07:54,067 --> 00:07:59,786
I just feel like I'm responsible
for keeping them apart,

79
00:08:00,601 --> 00:08:07,874
so I wouldn't be able to find peace
if they don't get back together.

80
00:08:08,645 --> 00:08:12,433
So, if I die...

81
00:08:12,633 --> 00:08:15,209
What the hell are you talking about?

82
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,468
Answer the question.

83
00:08:17,592 --> 00:08:20,288
Do you know anything about
that account or not?

84
00:08:27,685 --> 00:08:29,756
Let's try again.

85
00:08:31,866 --> 00:08:35,548
This will be my last
question, Hwang Taeseop.

86
00:08:38,561 --> 00:08:44,600
Have you ever received an
account from Yoo Chanseong?

87
00:08:53,652 --> 00:08:56,010
I really can't figure it out.

88
00:08:56,469 --> 00:09:00,558
Why did he betray me?

89
00:09:00,689 --> 00:09:06,758
A look at his profile and you'd
think he has no recollection of his past.

90
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:11,284
And for bringing someone like him
to the ANSP, you're really something.

91
00:09:11,532 --> 00:09:15,552
Should I call it "daring"?

92
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:23,178
You told me there was someone
you wanted to kill, right?

93
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:28,607
I could see that fire in your eyes
down at the shooting range.

94
00:09:29,412 --> 00:09:34,168
You still bear a grudge against this man?

95
00:09:34,343 --> 00:09:36,657
Is that how it looked?

96
00:09:37,211 --> 00:09:43,279
Isn't it time you finally tell
me what this is all about?

97
00:09:44,632 --> 00:09:45,491
Who is he?

98
00:09:45,629 --> 00:09:47,914
This man you bear a grudge against.

99
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:51,305
The man who killed my parents.

100
00:10:05,654 --> 00:10:07,998
Ohh... Jaechun.

101
00:10:08,892 --> 00:10:11,935
You remember the people who
helped us with the smuggling back then?

102
00:10:12,047 --> 00:10:16,177
Find out what they're doing these days.

103
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:19,379
Why are you suddenly asking about that?

104
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:24,487
I need to verify something.

105
00:10:33,836 --> 00:10:36,016
Just go.

106
00:10:38,476 --> 00:10:42,973
You're not feeling well,
so I'll spend the night here.

107
00:10:43,511 --> 00:10:45,636
I'm feeling much better.

108
00:10:46,728 --> 00:10:53,001
Do you know that my father loves you?

109
00:10:55,606 --> 00:10:59,900
You love him as well, right?

110
00:11:00,788 --> 00:11:05,343
The chairman is just a good
friend I like to hang out with.

111
00:11:05,445 --> 00:11:11,171
No matter how grateful you are, you
wouldn't just fall ill this way if that was true.

112
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:15,595
You don't need to hide it from me.

113
00:11:16,179 --> 00:11:21,635
I wish you'd just stop hiding
your feelings for each other.

114
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:28,748
Then, how about you?

115
00:11:29,185 --> 00:11:34,046
President Lee really seems to love you.

116
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:41,227
You love Lee Gangmo as well, don't you?

117
00:11:41,722 --> 00:11:43,570
Director...

118
00:11:47,121 --> 00:11:52,928
Forget about me, I'd rather see
you be a little more ambitious in that sense.

119
00:11:54,063 --> 00:11:56,610
Life is not that long.

120
00:11:57,002 --> 00:11:59,419
So make everything you want yours.

121
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:02,999
Be it money, any material goods or people.

122
00:12:06,711 --> 00:12:13,834
I'm just telling you this hoping
you won't live in regret like I did.

123
00:12:24,257 --> 00:12:26,003
We're back!

124
00:12:26,659 --> 00:12:29,217
Hi! Everybody.

125
00:12:29,412 --> 00:12:30,926
Good morning...

126
00:12:31,028 --> 00:12:32,867
Long time no see!

127
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:34,742
They don't understand a word, see?

128
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:37,268
That is, "I missed you."
Something like that.

129
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:39,247
Hyungnim, everything in order?

130
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:45,877
Order or not, what the hell have
you two been doing all this time?

131
00:12:45,964 --> 00:12:47,943
Was the UK down the block?

132
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,505
You can't imagine how
long that train ride was.

133
00:12:50,621 --> 00:12:52,775
Ohh... Where did they say it was again?

134
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,116
What was it...

135
00:12:54,213 --> 00:12:56,830
- Chicago... Was it Chicago?
- Oh, no!

136
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:59,674
- That's America. The States.
- Oops!

137
00:12:59,732 --> 00:13:02,351
You still have no clue, do you?

138
00:13:03,431 --> 00:13:04,866
Speak the truth.

139
00:13:04,991 --> 00:13:06,180
Why are you so late?

140
00:13:06,268 --> 00:13:07,750
What have you been doing together?

141
00:13:07,837 --> 00:13:10,079
Oppa, what's wrong with you,
are you crazy?

142
00:13:10,224 --> 00:13:12,461
Wh.... What, crazy?

143
00:13:12,586 --> 00:13:15,236
Are you taking this little rat's side now?

144
00:13:16,308 --> 00:13:19,110
Something is up, isn't it?
Right?

145
00:13:19,241 --> 00:13:20,682
What... What could possibly be up?

146
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:24,160
I swear on your mother
I didn't lay a finger on her.

147
00:13:24,247 --> 00:13:25,819
You mean it?
You better mean it?!

148
00:13:25,877 --> 00:13:28,337
You're choking me, stop it!

149
00:13:28,977 --> 00:13:34,526
Sotae would never be
capable of that, so just stop.

150
00:13:38,528 --> 00:13:41,121
So... So go ahead and tell me.

151
00:13:41,228 --> 00:13:42,494
What have you been doing?

152
00:13:42,585 --> 00:13:44,085
Ahh... I really...

153
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:46,500
I worked hard for Gangmo's sake,

154
00:13:46,613 --> 00:13:49,283
and forget being happy
to see me, you even...

155
00:13:49,575 --> 00:13:51,386
Ehh!

156
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,102
Follow me!

157
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:55,161
Oppa, you should be ashamed of yourself.

158
00:13:55,266 --> 00:13:59,337
He worked his ass off all this time,
how can you treat him like this?

159
00:13:59,628 --> 00:14:00,516
Sotae!

160
00:14:00,603 --> 00:14:03,500
That brat must be out of her mind...

161
00:14:03,849 --> 00:14:05,676
What's wrong with those two?

162
00:14:05,857 --> 00:14:08,732
Hey.... The way I see it...

163
00:14:09,023 --> 00:14:11,614
This is starting to smell.

164
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:17,610
No way...

165
00:14:22,587 --> 00:14:25,883
When will they let
you come back on TV?

166
00:14:26,508 --> 00:14:28,686
Guess they will sooner or later.

167
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:33,261
You're done with the ads, and
the composer isn't even bringing any new song.

168
00:14:33,476 --> 00:14:37,074
People will have forgotten your name by now.

169
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,841
Soojeong... Soojeong!

170
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:43,314
They want to cast you in a film!

171
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:44,283
A film?!

172
00:14:44,371 --> 00:14:46,981
You know Director Nam Shiyoung?

173
00:14:47,172 --> 00:14:48,405
I sure do!

174
00:14:48,525 --> 00:14:50,742
He's one of the most
successful directors these days.

175
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:53,632
Right... So the shoot for
his new film starts soon,

176
00:14:53,737 --> 00:14:56,029
and he wants you as the protagonist.

177
00:14:56,277 --> 00:14:57,355
Me?!

178
00:14:57,454 --> 00:14:58,391
That's right!

179
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,167
I guess seeing you on those
Hangang Construction TV commercials...

180
00:15:01,283 --> 00:15:03,775
left an impression on him.

181
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,620
Soojeong!

182
00:15:10,278 --> 00:15:12,502
So... Do you have any acting experience?

183
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,777
Yes... I've been taking acting lessons
since before my singing debut.

184
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:20,728
Then, I'd like to try a little reading...

185
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:22,236
Can you do that?

186
00:15:22,469 --> 00:15:24,725
- Affection -

187
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:27,588
Di... Director...

188
00:15:27,714 --> 00:15:29,726
That's a little...

189
00:15:29,926 --> 00:15:31,316
I'll give it a try.

190
00:15:31,533 --> 00:15:33,274
Soojeong...

191
00:15:45,485 --> 00:15:51,237
So this was the reason
why you abandoned me?

192
00:15:52,387 --> 00:15:55,967
If you did, then you should move on
and enjoy the rest of your life!

193
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:59,198
You come back?

194
00:15:59,588 --> 00:16:03,905
Seems like she's doing quite well.

195
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:07,878
Pretend you know nothing about this.

196
00:16:10,454 --> 00:16:13,315
To make it up for all you did
to me, it would take ten...

197
00:16:13,419 --> 00:16:15,370
No, even ten years wouldn't be enough.

198
00:16:15,464 --> 00:16:20,560
So... You must do it.

199
00:16:37,091 --> 00:16:39,099
Aren't you going to come in?

200
00:16:40,845 --> 00:16:42,592
Then...

201
00:16:56,779 --> 00:16:59,661
How is it going with Deputy Han?

202
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:02,935
Don't talk to me like that.

203
00:17:03,178 --> 00:17:06,482
I'm fine with it, but
insulting the deputy that way...

204
00:17:08,331 --> 00:17:10,635
What are you doing?

205
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:14,225
On second thought, I was foolish.

206
00:17:14,982 --> 00:17:18,043
Because if there's anything
one wants, he should take it.

207
00:17:18,169 --> 00:17:24,890
There's no need to worry about
your feelings or anything else.

208
00:17:25,181 --> 00:17:27,516
Don't act like this, Minwoo.

209
00:17:36,023 --> 00:17:37,823
But, you know...

210
00:17:39,773 --> 00:17:43,135
I don't feel all that tempted today.

211
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:44,890
- Did Chief Lee get off?
- Yes.

212
00:18:45,098 --> 00:18:46,728
Your report?

213
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,404
Here... They're all done.

214
00:18:58,402 --> 00:19:01,625
I can go now, right?

215
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:21,488
Lee Daesu had an older son?!

216
00:19:21,629 --> 00:19:22,925
Yes.

217
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:25,201
According to the men we sent on his trail,

218
00:19:25,314 --> 00:19:30,031
they said a high school
boy jumped off the train.

219
00:19:31,894 --> 00:19:33,444
That's Lee Seongmo.

220
00:19:33,619 --> 00:19:35,424
But... They were sure he died.

221
00:19:35,525 --> 00:19:37,376
They never verified his body.

222
00:19:37,474 --> 00:19:40,184
Yes... I guess that's true, but...

223
00:19:41,073 --> 00:19:47,159
There were two other people who
threatened me, saying they'd avenge their father.

224
00:19:47,358 --> 00:19:49,970
Lee Gangmo and Lee Miju.

225
00:19:50,261 --> 00:19:54,071
Now that I think about it,
all the lies Lee Seongmo told you...

226
00:19:54,161 --> 00:19:57,450
Lying about Lee Gangmo having
died at the Samcheong camp,

227
00:19:57,567 --> 00:20:00,608
and about Lee Miju having an abortion.

228
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:02,689
Then, it seems there is no doubt.

229
00:20:02,806 --> 00:20:07,416
Lee Seongmo and Lee
Gangmo must be brothers.

230
00:20:07,763 --> 00:20:10,137
I was too busy worrying
about all my enemies outside...

231
00:20:10,312 --> 00:20:13,732
to see what kind of
danger I was facing up-close.

232
00:20:14,211 --> 00:20:16,788
Lee Gangmo, Lee Miju,

233
00:20:17,574 --> 00:20:19,928
and Lee Seongmo.

234
00:20:21,699 --> 00:20:25,662
So they all were siblings...

235
00:20:37,596 --> 00:20:40,193
Clear evidence?!

236
00:20:41,474 --> 00:20:46,713
Are you sure Lee Seongmo mentioned that?

237
00:20:50,948 --> 00:20:54,302
It's a report that Ji Yeonsoo wrote today.

238
00:20:54,955 --> 00:20:57,591
This Wednesday night at nine,

239
00:20:57,872 --> 00:21:02,005
Lee Gangmo is going to
bring him that piece of evidence.

240
00:21:02,248 --> 00:21:04,111
Lee Gangmo?!

241
00:21:05,741 --> 00:21:12,325
You're telling me this informer is Lee Gangmo?

242
00:21:20,273 --> 00:21:25,016
By now, Jo Pilyeon must have
gotten a hold of the information we spread.

243
00:21:25,503 --> 00:21:29,079
What will you do
when he shows up there?

244
00:21:29,661 --> 00:21:34,100
We must force him to
confess his crimes on his own.

245
00:21:34,201 --> 00:21:37,258
We must never underestimate him.

246
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:42,075
He's not the kind of man who
would so easily fall into a trap.

247
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,985
I know.

248
00:21:44,639 --> 00:21:45,877
Hyung.

249
00:21:46,255 --> 00:21:49,995
You brought that report on
Congressman Oh's death, right?

250
00:21:59,126 --> 00:22:00,916
I looked at it a few times,

251
00:22:01,018 --> 00:22:05,253
but there was no evidence
pointing to Jo Pilyeon.

252
00:22:25,773 --> 00:22:28,684
Gangmo... Can you figure any of this out?

253
00:22:30,255 --> 00:22:35,396
When he called Seongmo,
Chanseong said he couldn't see a thing.

254
00:22:35,558 --> 00:22:37,421
He couldn't see?

255
00:22:37,552 --> 00:22:40,579
Why would he suddenly go blind?

256
00:22:42,543 --> 00:22:49,523
He couldn't see a thing, but he
was still pushing the accelerator.

257
00:22:49,792 --> 00:22:51,953
And not the brake.

258
00:22:55,446 --> 00:22:57,382
Why would he do that?

259
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:04,489
In his last call to me, he
mentioned the name Jo Pilyeon.

260
00:23:06,177 --> 00:23:10,401
If they have any evidence
regarding Oh Byeongtak's death,

261
00:23:10,507 --> 00:23:12,755
they could just report it to
the police and it'll be the end of it.

262
00:23:12,915 --> 00:23:15,843
There would be no reason
to spread false information.

263
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:18,776
Then, what else are they planning?

264
00:23:18,885 --> 00:23:21,428
Whatever that is, it doesn't matter.

265
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:25,266
What does is the fact that
they have the secret fund account.

266
00:23:25,732 --> 00:23:28,512
Give me a few of your men in support.

267
00:23:28,643 --> 00:23:31,027
If it's just Chief Yoon, I could understand.

268
00:23:31,131 --> 00:23:32,458
But I can't go beyond that.

269
00:23:32,551 --> 00:23:33,446
You can't?

270
00:23:33,562 --> 00:23:37,433
If I can't keep their mouth shut,
my head will be the first to roll!

271
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:41,006
You still don't know me?

272
00:23:41,385 --> 00:23:43,830
You will face no
repercussions, so rest assured.

273
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:48,298
And who would ever risk bringing
this up, when it involves the president?

274
00:23:49,244 --> 00:23:55,529
But bear in mind that it's the
last time I'll be able to help you.

275
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:58,814
It's this Wednesday.

276
00:23:59,179 --> 00:24:06,804
By Wednesday, everyone who's
been bothering us will be dealt with.

277
00:24:23,452 --> 00:24:28,370
If Jo Pilyeon uses Chief
Oh to deal with this,

278
00:24:28,574 --> 00:24:31,298
we'll need Congressman Min Honggi's help.

279
00:24:31,409 --> 00:24:36,433
Right... Better be sure, while we're at it.

280
00:24:36,807 --> 00:24:39,723
I'll meet Congressman Min.

281
00:24:39,854 --> 00:24:42,610
Right... You're taking good care
of the account, right?

282
00:24:42,697 --> 00:24:44,487
Don't worry.

283
00:24:44,917 --> 00:24:48,766
I hid in a place they will never find.

284
00:24:52,128 --> 00:24:55,390
Congressman Noh will soon be
announced as presidential candidate,

285
00:24:55,495 --> 00:24:58,235
I bet you must be really busy.

286
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:03,256
I believe Congressman Noh
should accept direct elections.

287
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:07,113
Two tigers are waging
war in the opposition camp.

288
00:25:07,367 --> 00:25:09,179
A consolidated stance
will never bring us success.

289
00:25:09,281 --> 00:25:11,814
So if the party doesn't
decide on a candidate of its own,

290
00:25:11,937 --> 00:25:15,275
I guess Congressman Noh
would have good chances of winning.

291
00:25:15,403 --> 00:25:20,288
Because the moment he accepts
direct elections, his popularity will benefit.

292
00:25:20,417 --> 00:25:23,390
We're about to get our
hands on clear evidence...

293
00:25:23,518 --> 00:25:27,461
proving that Jo Pilyeon killed Congressman Oh.

294
00:25:27,756 --> 00:25:29,262
Did you figure out the situation?

295
00:25:29,379 --> 00:25:33,099
My brother and I will set
up a trap and wait for him.

296
00:25:33,341 --> 00:25:38,484
So I was wondering if
we could count on your help.

297
00:25:38,976 --> 00:25:43,534
If only to help Congressman Oh
find some peace, I can't ignore this.

298
00:25:43,723 --> 00:25:44,523
Tell me.

299
00:25:44,684 --> 00:25:47,297
What can I do to help you?

300
00:25:53,339 --> 00:25:54,663
Congressman.

301
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,181
Why would you even agonize over it?

302
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:58,986
Without making things
more complicated than they are,

303
00:25:59,131 --> 00:26:01,387
we can just catch
them both in the act, and...

304
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:06,031
Our goal is that of getting
our hands on that account.

305
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:12,707
And there is no way they'd
bring the account there.

306
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:15,548
Then, how do you plan to proceed?

307
00:26:15,658 --> 00:26:17,572
You just wait.

308
00:26:18,353 --> 00:26:24,810
That trap they set up to catch me
will become their own burial spot.

309
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:44,801
Yes?

310
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:45,933
It's me, Gangmo.

311
00:26:46,028 --> 00:26:47,307
Ohh! Jeongyeon.

312
00:26:47,402 --> 00:26:48,856
Where are you now?

313
00:26:49,067 --> 00:26:51,611
Here?
Deoksu Palace.

314
00:26:52,859 --> 00:26:54,446
Deoksu Palace?!

315
00:26:54,608 --> 00:26:56,250
And why did you go there?

316
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:57,968
What's the matter?

317
00:26:58,216 --> 00:27:00,566
Ahh.... Nevermind, Gangmo.

318
00:27:00,662 --> 00:27:02,221
Sorry for getting in the way.

319
00:27:02,334 --> 00:27:04,342
Getting in the way of what?

320
00:27:05,391 --> 00:27:09,093
By any chance, are you and Suyeon...

321
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:12,295
What are you saying? I'm alone.

322
00:27:12,673 --> 00:27:13,867
Alone?

323
00:27:14,064 --> 00:27:16,214
You went there alone?

324
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:17,680
Yeah.

325
00:27:17,915 --> 00:27:20,343
I just needed some time alone to think.

326
00:27:22,948 --> 00:27:24,568
Gangmo...

327
00:27:24,688 --> 00:27:26,649
Can I come there, too?

328
00:27:26,747 --> 00:27:27,929
Now?

329
00:27:28,085 --> 00:27:30,763
Yeah... Why not?

330
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,161
All right, then.

331
00:27:33,264 --> 00:27:35,391
Will be there in a moment.

332
00:27:42,165 --> 00:27:43,942
Gangmo.

333
00:27:46,446 --> 00:27:49,630
- Shall we take a walk?
- Sure.

334
00:27:51,984 --> 00:27:54,159
Those falling leaves are so pretty.

335
00:27:54,683 --> 00:27:58,704
I haven't been here
in a while, feels really nice.

336
00:28:06,213 --> 00:28:08,265
Something is up, isn't it?

337
00:28:09,648 --> 00:28:12,297
A look at you and it feels like
you have something to tell me?

338
00:28:14,534 --> 00:28:21,281
Actually... Today we were granted
a permit for the credit institution.

339
00:28:21,459 --> 00:28:23,179
Jeongyeon...

340
00:28:24,925 --> 00:28:26,424
But...

341
00:28:26,823 --> 00:28:31,611
I'm so worried about Dad that
it ruined my day a little.

342
00:28:34,988 --> 00:28:38,059
I wanted to at least tell someone...

343
00:28:38,961 --> 00:28:40,722
I feel really strange, Gangmo.

344
00:28:40,894 --> 00:28:42,702
You should be happy!

345
00:28:42,949 --> 00:28:45,802
And the chairman will be ecstatic as well.

346
00:28:46,486 --> 00:28:47,583
Right.

347
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:50,386
Dad will be happy, too.

348
00:28:51,914 --> 00:28:53,168
Then, let's do this.

349
00:28:53,263 --> 00:28:55,841
I'm so happy I'm about to go crazy.

350
00:28:55,944 --> 00:28:59,577
I'll be happy for everyone
else, so just watch me.

351
00:29:01,309 --> 00:29:04,045
Our Jeongyeon did it!!

352
00:29:06,563 --> 00:29:08,352
Everyone!!

353
00:29:08,442 --> 00:29:11,570
Jeongyeon did it!

354
00:29:14,029 --> 00:29:15,912
Gangmo!

355
00:29:33,231 --> 00:29:36,491
Jeongyeon!!

356
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,116
Don't be angry, Sotae...

357
00:29:52,203 --> 00:29:54,934
My brother has always
been the suspicious type.

358
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,472
What am I, a thief?
A conman?

359
00:29:57,719 --> 00:30:00,968
Ahh... It drives me insane, really.
Should just marry someone else.

360
00:30:01,183 --> 00:30:04,076
So you'd abandon me and get married?

361
00:30:04,168 --> 00:30:05,792
I didn't mean that,

362
00:30:05,896 --> 00:30:08,360
but Shideok always acts so grumpy...

363
00:30:08,455 --> 00:30:10,128
You said you love me.

364
00:30:10,232 --> 00:30:11,547
That I'm your first love!

365
00:30:11,637 --> 00:30:15,063
The first since I came out
of the Samcheong camp, sure.

366
00:30:15,863 --> 00:30:17,346
You bastard!

367
00:30:17,668 --> 00:30:19,312
Men are all the same!

368
00:30:19,429 --> 00:30:22,990
How can you dare say you'll
abandon me and marry another woman?

369
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,696
Gyeongja.
Can't you trust me?

370
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,957
I'm Park Sotae.

371
00:30:29,102 --> 00:30:32,784
I'm yours already.

372
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:34,352
Really?

373
00:30:34,589 --> 00:30:36,011
Sure.

374
00:30:36,224 --> 00:30:42,444
So I guess all your apartments and
company holdings are mine as well?!

375
00:30:42,808 --> 00:30:45,052
Company holdings, too?

376
00:30:45,166 --> 00:30:46,206
Why?

377
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,261
Feel bad about it?

378
00:30:47,334 --> 00:30:49,371
Ahh... Who said anything...

379
00:30:49,459 --> 00:30:55,037
They're yours, all right.
I'm all yours anyway.

380
00:30:59,068 --> 00:31:02,590
Ahh... Those lips really...

381
00:31:10,749 --> 00:31:12,903
Hey Sotae, where...

382
00:31:16,396 --> 00:31:17,980
Knock, will you?

383
00:31:18,094 --> 00:31:22,596
You fool, I knock to
go down the stairs?

384
00:31:28,074 --> 00:31:31,159
It's the tracking device you asked for.

385
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,696
Where are you going to use this?

386
00:31:35,307 --> 00:31:39,455
Tomorrow, anything could happen.

387
00:31:40,197 --> 00:31:41,774
So that's why I need it.

388
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,987
Be careful, Gangmo.

389
00:31:44,933 --> 00:31:50,013
I feel like you're being used as a
bait, so I don't feel good about it.

390
00:31:50,536 --> 00:31:52,914
You called Congressman Min, right?

391
00:31:53,009 --> 00:31:58,526
The police will be
planted there waiting for you.

392
00:31:59,283 --> 00:32:01,131
This is our last chance, Hyung.

393
00:32:01,873 --> 00:32:03,634
If we lose it,

394
00:32:03,925 --> 00:32:06,778
we might never get another
opportunity to bring Jo Pilyeon down.

395
00:32:08,888 --> 00:32:10,096
Gangmo.

396
00:32:10,431 --> 00:32:18,090
Once all this is over, I was planning
to accept Hwang Jeongyeon into our family.

397
00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:19,277
Hyung...

398
00:32:19,382 --> 00:32:22,369
I know that you two are still in love.

399
00:32:22,721 --> 00:32:25,344
And I have no intention of opposing it.

400
00:32:25,452 --> 00:32:27,593
I'll be honest.

401
00:32:29,631 --> 00:32:33,833
I really love Jeongyeon.

402
00:32:34,502 --> 00:32:39,000
But I can't marry her.

403
00:32:39,873 --> 00:32:44,006
Miju even gave birth to a child
and broke up with Minwoo anyway.

404
00:32:44,239 --> 00:32:46,238
Chairman Hwang and
Jo Pilyeon are different.

405
00:32:46,369 --> 00:32:49,731
The suffering Miju went through
is no different from mine, Hyung.

406
00:32:49,847 --> 00:32:53,035
If it's because of
me, just don't, Oppa.

407
00:32:53,486 --> 00:32:57,837
I know that Chairman Hwang
did enough to deserve our forgiveness.

408
00:32:58,041 --> 00:33:00,821
So don't let Jeongyeon
Eonni go and marry her, Oppa.

409
00:33:00,966 --> 00:33:02,054
Miju.

410
00:33:02,218 --> 00:33:04,540
Every time I look at you,
I get depressed.

411
00:33:04,656 --> 00:33:07,145
Are you going to grow
old and die all by yourself?

412
00:33:07,716 --> 00:33:09,677
Same goes for you, Big Oppa.

413
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:12,384
At least you, get married.

414
00:33:12,545 --> 00:33:15,805
You won't find another woman
like Jeongyeon Eonni even if you try.

415
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:19,836
First, let's deal with all this,

416
00:33:19,945 --> 00:33:22,258
and then we'll talk about this again.

417
00:33:24,747 --> 00:33:28,065
I'll soon have my film debut.

418
00:33:30,146 --> 00:33:31,127
Film?!

419
00:33:31,237 --> 00:33:34,325
I'm going to become an actress.

420
00:33:34,438 --> 00:33:35,889
Really?

421
00:33:36,198 --> 00:33:37,169
Miju, you...

422
00:33:37,278 --> 00:33:39,491
Wow... Lee Miju.

423
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:41,535
Really?!

424
00:34:18,774 --> 00:34:20,853
Aren't you going home?

425
00:34:20,961 --> 00:34:22,399
Going now.

426
00:34:22,784 --> 00:34:24,732
Aren't you writing reports, these days?

427
00:34:24,839 --> 00:34:27,086
They said I could stop writing them.

428
00:34:27,595 --> 00:34:30,535
So I guess you won't need
to follow me around all day, either.

429
00:34:33,082 --> 00:34:35,891
Wait for me!

430
00:34:45,378 --> 00:34:47,474
I need to make a call.

431
00:34:51,549 --> 00:34:54,420
Let's have a word.

432
00:34:54,663 --> 00:34:57,119
Come with me.

433
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:01,788
- I have an appointment.
- Cancel it.

434
00:35:01,913 --> 00:35:03,624
It's urgent.

435
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:20,895
What is going on?

436
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,746
Your brother still hasn't called.

437
00:35:22,935 --> 00:35:25,831
Something went wrong already?!

438
00:35:26,049 --> 00:35:30,124
I guess Jo Pilyeon doesn't plan
to fall into this trap so easily.

439
00:35:30,233 --> 00:35:33,116
What's that supposed to mean?

440
00:35:38,253 --> 00:35:40,261
And what's that?

441
00:35:40,391 --> 00:35:44,729
Listen well to what I'm about to say.

442
00:36:01,341 --> 00:36:03,100
Lee Gangmo.

443
00:36:03,566 --> 00:36:05,545
We need to ask you a few questions.

444
00:36:06,957 --> 00:36:09,969
I have done nothing
warranting an investigation.

445
00:36:12,907 --> 00:36:16,562
I suggest you don't
make a scene and just follow me.

446
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:25,517
What did you bring
me all the way here for?

447
00:36:25,838 --> 00:36:30,170
You'll have to stay here with me tonight.

448
00:36:30,392 --> 00:36:32,077
So this is surveillance.

449
00:36:32,197 --> 00:36:35,600
Just think of it as a
little night duty with me.

450
00:36:37,139 --> 00:36:40,064
What did Jo Pilyeon
promise you for this?

451
00:36:41,301 --> 00:36:45,798
I'm sure that you're well aware
of the fact that Jo Pilyeon is responsible...

452
00:36:47,996 --> 00:36:49,859
for the deaths of
Chanseong and Congressman Oh.

453
00:36:49,946 --> 00:36:52,017
Hey... Lee Seongmo!

454
00:36:52,541 --> 00:36:55,117
What are you trying to say?

455
00:37:06,483 --> 00:37:12,414
Don't you think that sending Ji Yeonsoo to
write reports and spy on me and Chanseong...

456
00:37:12,618 --> 00:37:15,340
was despicable?

457
00:37:15,573 --> 00:37:18,207
Enough with that crap!

458
00:37:18,512 --> 00:37:20,987
Want me to spell it out?

459
00:37:21,369 --> 00:37:25,293
It was exactly what you did that
killed Congressman Oh and Chanseong.

460
00:37:25,506 --> 00:37:29,310
You got that girl involved and she caused
Chanseong's death without even realizing it.

461
00:37:42,229 --> 00:37:44,134
Whatever you keep yapping about,

462
00:37:44,259 --> 00:37:45,335
it's no use.

463
00:37:45,437 --> 00:37:46,863
Is it?

464
00:37:48,314 --> 00:37:50,487
But if that evidence emerges,

465
00:37:50,632 --> 00:37:53,121
then it's over for you as well.

466
00:37:53,761 --> 00:37:55,893
Since you abetted and
participated indirectly in that murder.

467
00:37:55,994 --> 00:37:57,304
Hey!

468
00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:01,699
You little prick, think I
don't know that you wrote that account...

469
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:05,003
and had been plotting this all along?

470
00:38:08,089 --> 00:38:11,319
Again with the groundless accusations?

471
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:14,788
I've really had it with that.

472
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:21,541
This is the last time you'll
ever play the innocence card.

473
00:38:47,251 --> 00:38:48,998
Yes, Congressman.

474
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:52,898
We're heading that way as we speak.

475
00:38:54,368 --> 00:38:55,940
Don't worry.

476
00:38:56,212 --> 00:39:01,396
I was particularly careful,
so nobody is on our trail.

477
00:39:11,162 --> 00:39:13,156
That's fascinating...

478
00:39:13,337 --> 00:39:16,023
So we know wherever
they're taking Gangmo to?

479
00:39:16,125 --> 00:39:18,297
Ahh... Will you please stop
with all that nonsense?

480
00:39:18,391 --> 00:39:19,550
Call this number.

481
00:39:19,654 --> 00:39:21,279
All right.

482
00:39:30,578 --> 00:39:33,964
It's past nine already, what is going on?

483
00:39:43,118 --> 00:39:44,021
Yes.

484
00:39:44,151 --> 00:39:46,393
Congressman Min Honggi, right?

485
00:39:46,629 --> 00:39:50,371
I call you on behalf of President Lee Gangmo.

486
00:39:50,706 --> 00:39:53,025
Why is no one showing up?

487
00:39:53,196 --> 00:39:57,298
President Lee has been
abducted by Jo Pilyeon.

488
00:39:57,429 --> 00:39:58,506
What?!

489
00:39:58,749 --> 00:40:02,538
Then, did he find out about our plans?

490
00:40:02,683 --> 00:40:04,322
Not yet.

491
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:06,675
I'm trailing Gangmo right now.

492
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,527
If you remain there, I'll bring you
to him the moment I find where he is.

493
00:40:10,678 --> 00:40:14,331
No, forget that...
Tell me where you are now.

494
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:15,815
Yes.

495
00:40:16,551 --> 00:40:18,682
All right. I'll go there.

496
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:24,161
But before that, you'll have
to set Chief Lee Seongmo free.

497
00:40:24,379 --> 00:40:26,489
And what's that all about?

498
00:40:45,876 --> 00:40:48,998
They're looking for you,
so I redirected the call here.

499
00:40:49,276 --> 00:40:52,345
- Who is it?
- Congressman Min Honggi, Sir.

500
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,849
I ought to...
You goddamned fool!

501
00:40:55,007 --> 00:40:57,030
Didn't I tell you to say I got off already?

502
00:40:58,645 --> 00:41:00,319
It's me, Congressman.

503
00:41:00,944 --> 00:41:04,234
I will convey whatever
you tell me, so go ahead.

504
00:41:04,918 --> 00:41:06,315
Yes.

505
00:41:07,348 --> 00:41:08,687
All right.

506
00:41:09,398 --> 00:41:11,483
I will tell them.

507
00:41:15,849 --> 00:41:18,469
He told me to come out.

508
00:41:23,956 --> 00:41:28,667
We're going to catch Jo
Pilyeon now, care to join us?

509
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:39,596
I hope you won't ruin your entire
existence because of Jo Pilyeon.

510
00:41:50,681 --> 00:41:52,224
Chief Yoon...

511
00:41:53,243 --> 00:41:55,149
Call Chief Yoon.

512
00:41:55,557 --> 00:41:56,197
What?

513
00:41:56,372 --> 00:41:59,282
I said call Chief Yoon right now!

514
00:42:25,653 --> 00:42:27,432
Go outside and inspect the premises.

515
00:42:27,526 --> 00:42:29,437
All right, Sir.

516
00:42:37,991 --> 00:42:39,185
Search him.

517
00:42:39,345 --> 00:42:40,698
Yes.

518
00:42:46,927 --> 00:42:48,354
What?

519
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:50,219
All right.

520
00:42:50,384 --> 00:42:52,509
We'll pull back immediately.

521
00:43:05,858 --> 00:43:06,964
You can do it, right?

522
00:43:07,037 --> 00:43:09,642
Or else, what,
should I let them kill us?

523
00:43:09,715 --> 00:43:13,877
I'll bring Congressman Min,
so don't let them spot you.

524
00:43:13,965 --> 00:43:18,447
Ahh... I'm still suffering from
jet-lag, what is all this?

525
00:43:18,593 --> 00:43:21,081
- Be careful.
- All right.

526
00:43:35,754 --> 00:43:36,671
Yes.

527
00:43:36,802 --> 00:43:38,921
Hyung.
It's me, Shideok.

528
00:43:39,066 --> 00:43:41,584
Where is Gangmo being held?

529
00:44:13,492 --> 00:44:16,385
It might have been a
good showing on your part,

530
00:44:16,473 --> 00:44:19,197
but I'm afraid that won't cut it with me.

531
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:25,911
So let's hear it, what's this clear
evidence you wanted to lure me here with?

532
00:44:26,021 --> 00:44:27,909
Were you so scared of it
that you abducted me?

533
00:44:28,016 --> 00:44:30,999
I wasn't scared, just curious.

534
00:44:31,185 --> 00:44:34,241
And I also came to
get something from you.

535
00:44:36,555 --> 00:44:38,374
Speak!

536
00:44:38,913 --> 00:44:43,513
What on earth is this
clear evidence you talked about?

537
00:44:49,146 --> 00:44:52,799
- Seeing how much you hesitate...
- You forget a little detail,

538
00:44:53,216 --> 00:44:57,718
the fact that abducting me is
like admitting you killed Congressman Oh.

539
00:45:01,695 --> 00:45:06,468
I'm sure that's not your clear evidence...

540
00:45:07,065 --> 00:45:10,689
That's much too sloppy a
trap even for someone like you.

541
00:45:10,981 --> 00:45:15,088
You had no evidence about
Congressman Oh's death to begin with.

542
00:45:15,193 --> 00:45:17,164
Sleeping tablets.

543
00:45:22,616 --> 00:45:26,131
You fed Yoo Chanseong sleeping tablets.

544
00:45:26,236 --> 00:45:30,976
And I'm sure you followed the car
him and Congressman Oh were riding.

545
00:45:31,265 --> 00:45:34,686
Holding the very same
gun you're pointing at me, of course.

546
00:45:35,598 --> 00:45:41,060
To destroy any evidence, you even
had their bodies cremated.

547
00:45:42,501 --> 00:45:47,530
However, despite having
meticulously planned all that,

548
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:50,952
- you made a fatal mistake.
- Don't make me laugh!

549
00:45:51,633 --> 00:45:53,708
There could be no mistake whatsoever,

550
00:45:53,921 --> 00:45:56,570
since my plan was flawless.

551
00:46:00,645 --> 00:46:04,910
So you finally admitted it.

552
00:46:05,416 --> 00:46:06,609
What?!

553
00:46:06,702 --> 00:46:12,882
You've just admitted that
you killed Congressman Oh Byeongtak.

554
00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:30,570
So you'll kill me?!

555
00:46:31,676 --> 00:46:36,766
Since if I do, any
evidence will be buried along with you.

556
00:46:36,874 --> 00:46:39,968
Will killing me really get rid of it?

557
00:46:40,099 --> 00:46:42,923
Who else... Lee Seongmo?

558
00:46:44,727 --> 00:46:49,519
That fool had the guts to
write that secret fund account.

559
00:46:49,625 --> 00:46:55,284
Even if I get rid of him,
who will ever blame me for it?

560
00:46:59,112 --> 00:47:01,513
The moment you pull that trigger,

561
00:47:02,056 --> 00:47:05,340
the secret fund account
will be revealed to the world.

562
00:47:06,447 --> 00:47:10,610
You really think I didn't take
any precaution before coming here?

563
00:47:12,065 --> 00:47:14,059
So how about this?

564
00:47:15,909 --> 00:47:18,731
In exchange for your life,

565
00:47:19,234 --> 00:47:23,213
Lee Seongmo will bring me the account.

566
00:47:23,883 --> 00:47:30,878
I'm sure Lee Seongmo will value
your life a lot more than that account?!

567
00:47:30,994 --> 00:47:33,512
Am I wrong?

568
00:47:49,852 --> 00:47:51,700
Jaechun?

569
00:48:20,673 --> 00:48:22,319
Where are you going?

570
00:48:28,909 --> 00:48:29,854
Give it here!

571
00:48:29,954 --> 00:48:33,095
Would you do that if you were me,
you sorry-ass son of a cunt?

572
00:48:38,814 --> 00:48:41,332
Come here!

573
00:48:43,537 --> 00:48:45,713
Stop there, you prick!

574
00:48:52,416 --> 00:48:55,269
No way... Don't!

575
00:49:17,035 --> 00:49:19,433
Gangmo is in danger!

576
00:49:20,341 --> 00:49:21,660
This is all we need.

577
00:49:21,762 --> 00:49:25,327
I'll go after him, so go inside!

578
00:49:25,689 --> 00:49:27,365
Come on!

579
00:49:30,555 --> 00:49:34,452
You prick... You're dead!

580
00:49:40,504 --> 00:49:42,414
If you want to survive,

581
00:49:42,537 --> 00:49:47,970
you'll have to ask your brother
Lee Seongmo to bring me that account.

582
00:49:53,709 --> 00:49:55,208
This watch...

583
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:58,192
Doesn't it look familiar?

584
00:49:59,909 --> 00:50:02,703
I hear they use it at the ANSP.

585
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:06,298
It's a tracking device, apparently.

586
00:50:13,826 --> 00:50:16,592
It's all over, Jo Pilyeon.

587
00:50:17,467 --> 00:50:23,679
Congressman Min Honggi and
the police are waiting outside.

588
00:50:36,604 --> 00:50:42,650
I've been gritting my teeth
for all those wretched years,

589
00:50:42,984 --> 00:50:46,012
and it was only for this moment.

590
00:50:52,823 --> 00:50:57,116
If you really think you
can kill me, pull the trigger.

591
00:51:11,725 --> 00:51:13,877
Don't do it, Hyung.

592
00:51:15,944 --> 00:51:19,204
I suggest you kill me while you still can.

593
00:51:19,650 --> 00:51:26,961
Or else, your lives will be
ruined for abducting a congressman.

594
00:51:27,077 --> 00:51:30,249
You killed Chanseong.

595
00:51:30,933 --> 00:51:33,974
You're the man who
murdered Congressman Oh!

596
00:51:34,388 --> 00:51:38,675
You know what article 307 clause 1
of the Korean Criminal Procedure Code states?

597
00:51:39,869 --> 00:51:44,453
"Facts can only be
acknowledged through evidence."

598
00:51:44,875 --> 00:51:49,555
Without any evidence, you can scream I'm
a murderer all you want, but it'll be useless.

599
00:51:56,802 --> 00:51:59,189
You know what this is?

600
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:09,168
Every single word we
exchanged has been carefully recorded.

601
00:52:10,550 --> 00:52:12,210
W.... What?!

602
00:52:12,341 --> 00:52:17,522
You confessed it to me on your own.

603
00:52:18,034 --> 00:52:22,394
That you fed Yoo Chanseong
those sleeping tablets,

604
00:52:22,510 --> 00:52:24,621
and killed him and Congressman Oh!

605
00:52:26,877 --> 00:52:32,203
Criminal Procedure Code,
article 307 clause 1?!

606
00:52:34,139 --> 00:52:36,838
How kind of you to remind me.

607
00:52:37,656 --> 00:52:41,233
You son of a bitch...

608
00:53:42,819 --> 00:53:44,871
Gangmo!

609
00:53:54,802 --> 00:53:56,968
Here it is.

610
00:54:00,389 --> 00:54:04,856
It's evidence proving that Jo
Pilyeon killed Congressman Oh Byeongtak.

611
00:54:11,488 --> 00:54:13,176
Take him out.

612
00:54:48,784 --> 00:54:52,272
You two are incredible.

613
00:54:52,379 --> 00:54:56,733
You managed to bring down
a giant even politics couldn't touch.

614
00:55:28,117 --> 00:55:31,677
So you were able to tape evidence
proving who the murderer was?

615
00:55:31,801 --> 00:55:33,226
Open it.

616
00:55:42,843 --> 00:55:44,392
There's nothing here.

617
00:55:44,515 --> 00:55:46,297
Nothing?!

618
00:55:46,403 --> 00:55:47,759
There is no tape.

619
00:55:47,853 --> 00:55:51,749
What are you saying?
I shot it myself!

620
00:55:55,271 --> 00:55:56,246
What's going on?

621
00:55:56,371 --> 00:55:57,494
There is no way!

622
00:55:57,574 --> 00:55:59,843
I checked the tape with my own eyes!

623
00:55:59,944 --> 00:56:02,069
So why is this empty?

624
00:56:02,266 --> 00:56:06,506
It was him. Go Jaechun.

625
00:56:06,898 --> 00:56:08,629
I'm sure he took it out.

626
00:56:08,721 --> 00:56:12,310
Right... That sorry-ass cunt
took it and ran away.

627
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:14,500
Send people out and
find Go Jaechun right away!

628
00:56:14,603 --> 00:56:18,428
But, without evidence, we'll
be forced to release Congressman Jo.

629
00:56:18,524 --> 00:56:20,312
They're all witnesses!

630
00:56:20,408 --> 00:56:21,781
Go catch him!

631
00:56:21,888 --> 00:56:24,017
All right, Sir.

632
00:56:29,318 --> 00:56:31,170
Don't worry, Hyung.

633
00:56:31,356 --> 00:56:33,510
Go Jaechun will be caught soon.

634
00:56:41,603 --> 00:56:47,599
So they issued that permit
for your credit institution?

635
00:56:48,807 --> 00:56:50,219
Yes.

636
00:56:51,383 --> 00:56:56,595
But I'm even happier that you're safe.

637
00:56:58,087 --> 00:57:04,611
Unless I see you give me a grandchild,

638
00:57:04,737 --> 00:57:07,897
I'm never going to die, you silly.

639
00:57:10,283 --> 00:57:12,291
But...

640
00:57:13,950 --> 00:57:16,555
Where is Jeongshik?

641
00:57:16,764 --> 00:57:20,499
His father barely made
it out of there alive...

642
00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:23,162
That...

643
00:57:24,647 --> 00:57:29,385
After you were arrested, he
just disappeared without leaving a trace.

644
00:57:30,242 --> 00:57:31,887
Chairman!

645
00:57:33,604 --> 00:57:35,831
Come on in, Gangmo.

646
00:57:36,165 --> 00:57:44,558
Hey... I almost risked
meeting your father, you know?

647
00:57:49,841 --> 00:57:51,500
Gangmo.

648
00:57:52,999 --> 00:57:55,093
Come out with me a moment.

649
00:57:55,473 --> 00:57:56,332
Why?

650
00:57:56,477 --> 00:57:59,737
Ohh... Let's go... buy something.

651
00:58:18,512 --> 00:58:26,853
Isn't it time you let
Jeongyeon call you Mother?

652
00:58:33,407 --> 00:58:39,578
Now that you're
back with us, I should.

653
00:58:40,145 --> 00:58:41,862
Right.

654
00:58:47,568 --> 00:58:49,285
Gyeongok...

655
00:58:49,678 --> 00:58:54,029
I.... really...

656
00:58:54,655 --> 00:58:56,853
It hurt like hell.

657
00:58:57,217 --> 00:58:59,371
You know?

658
00:58:59,557 --> 00:59:02,398
It felt like I was dying.

659
00:59:05,425 --> 00:59:07,282
But...

660
00:59:10,004 --> 00:59:18,910
The thought of dying without
ever seeing you and Jeongyeon again...

661
00:59:21,195 --> 00:59:26,843
hurt me more than anything else.

662
00:59:30,785 --> 00:59:32,868
Gyeongok...

663
00:59:34,484 --> 00:59:39,021
It hurt so much...

664
01:00:09,742 --> 01:00:10,636
Yes.

665
01:00:10,804 --> 01:00:12,580
Minwoo, it's me.

666
01:00:14,501 --> 01:00:15,372
What's the matter?

667
01:00:15,481 --> 01:00:18,168
Listen well, Minwoo.

668
01:00:18,750 --> 01:00:24,223
You're the only one
who can save the congressman.

669
01:00:24,761 --> 01:00:26,013
What are you trying to say?

670
01:00:26,165 --> 01:00:31,668
The congressman has been arrested
for the murder of Congressman Oh.

671
01:00:34,782 --> 01:00:39,105
It's not a situation I
can solve on my own right now.

672
01:00:39,409 --> 01:00:44,416
By now... The police might have
issued a search warrant for me.

673
01:00:44,636 --> 01:00:46,024
Where are you now?

674
01:00:46,206 --> 01:00:50,208
No... No need to come here.

675
01:00:51,224 --> 01:00:55,739
Minwoo, all you need to do is find that.

676
01:00:56,161 --> 01:00:58,300
Will you tell me what's going on?

677
01:01:00,362 --> 01:01:02,811
Lee Gangmo fooled us.

678
01:01:02,919 --> 01:01:04,386
Did you just say Lee Gangmo?

679
01:01:04,483 --> 01:01:09,269
Your father fell right into his trap.

680
01:01:09,909 --> 01:01:15,046
You must find that videotape and get rid of it.

681
01:01:15,217 --> 01:01:19,178
With that out of the picture,
we can save your father.

682
01:01:19,881 --> 01:01:21,870
Where is Seongmo now?

683
01:01:22,002 --> 01:01:25,203
- That's a job for...
- Not Lee Seongmo!

684
01:01:27,226 --> 01:01:31,563
He's a traitor.

685
01:01:33,450 --> 01:01:37,991
What is that supposed to mean?

686
01:01:38,311 --> 01:01:40,043
Minwoo...

687
01:01:40,887 --> 01:01:45,515
Listen well to what I'm about to say.

688
01:01:57,216 --> 01:02:00,577
- Letter of Resignation -

689
01:02:21,777 --> 01:02:26,416
It was exactly what you did that
killed Congressman Oh and Chanseong.

690
01:02:26,552 --> 01:02:30,268
You got that girl involved and she caused
Chanseong's death without even realizing it.

691
01:02:34,532 --> 01:02:37,605
I'm sorry, Chief Yoo...

692
01:02:42,218 --> 01:02:45,551
I'm sorry, Chief Lee...

693
01:02:58,998 --> 01:03:02,200
So he hit me right here,

694
01:03:02,367 --> 01:03:04,063
and started running this way.

695
01:03:04,165 --> 01:03:06,755
And then the car came and hit him.

696
01:03:06,861 --> 01:03:10,740
But then he got up and just... this way...

697
01:03:10,929 --> 01:03:12,588
He ran away.

698
01:03:12,923 --> 01:03:14,044
How about the factory?

699
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:16,969
I looked all over with Sotae,
but no traces.

700
01:03:17,083 --> 01:03:21,025
If Go Jaechun took it, he might
have already destroyed the evidence.

701
01:03:21,218 --> 01:03:22,949
Then, what happens now?

702
01:03:23,038 --> 01:03:24,320
What do you think?

703
01:03:24,416 --> 01:03:26,267
Jo Pilyeon, that sorry-ass cunt...

704
01:03:26,361 --> 01:03:27,488
will have to be released again.

705
01:03:27,598 --> 01:03:29,220
How can that happen...

706
01:03:29,316 --> 01:03:33,976
First, even if we're the ones
who testify, we must bring him to court.

707
01:03:34,086 --> 01:03:38,104
He still is being
backed by influential names.

708
01:03:38,684 --> 01:03:40,985
Unless we have clear evidence against him,

709
01:03:41,335 --> 01:03:44,030
it won't be easy under this regime.

716
01:04:30,376 --> 01:04:33,160
Are you telling me Jo Pilyeon will be released?

717
01:04:33,284 --> 01:04:35,284
Is there a chance
he'll become prime minister?

718
01:04:35,395 --> 01:04:36,311
Jo Minwoo...

719
01:04:36,428 --> 01:04:37,578
will be given wings, then.

720
01:04:37,650 --> 01:04:39,546
You want me to get rid of Lee Seongmo?

721
01:04:39,651 --> 01:04:41,772
If he finds that tape,

722
01:04:41,881 --> 01:04:43,893
it's all over for the both of us!

723
01:04:44,006 --> 01:04:45,673
I'm sure he's alive.

724
01:04:45,784 --> 01:04:50,766
Before Lee Gangmo beats us to it,
we must get our hands on him.
