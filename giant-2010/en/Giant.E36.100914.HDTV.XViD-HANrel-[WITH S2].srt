4
00:00:11,062 --> 00:00:12,921
Dad.

5
00:00:13,231 --> 00:00:15,250
You did it.

6
00:00:15,554 --> 00:00:17,937
We can protect our company now.

7
00:00:18,906 --> 00:00:20,899
<i>Chairman Hwang.</i>

8
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:33,028
Mom...

9
00:00:33,521 --> 00:00:34,805
I'm fine.

10
00:00:34,906 --> 00:00:36,509
Everything is fine.

11
00:00:36,653 --> 00:00:39,137
<i>I'm all right.</i>

12
00:00:40,755 --> 00:00:43,282
Who is Oh Namsuk?

13
00:00:44,946 --> 00:00:49,438
You're under investigation for fraud
and forgery of private documents.

14
00:00:52,544 --> 00:00:54,082
Mom... Mom!

15
00:00:54,198 --> 00:00:55,844
Mom!

16
00:00:55,916 --> 00:00:57,563
<i>Mom!</i>

17
00:00:57,621 --> 00:01:00,451
<i>Ahh... Let go! Mom!</i>

18
00:01:22,286 --> 00:01:23,200
What?

19
00:01:23,316 --> 00:01:25,886
Hwang Taeseop showed up
at the shareholders' meeting?!

20
00:01:26,031 --> 00:01:27,128
Yes.

21
00:01:27,273 --> 00:01:29,511
Mister Kim just called me.

22
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,360
He said all our plans failed.

23
00:01:31,432 --> 00:01:36,553
Who's behind this... 
Who brought Hwang Taeseop there?

24
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:39,393
There's no time to wait.

25
00:01:42,175 --> 00:01:45,843
Minwoo, that fool...
As if things weren't bad enough...

26
00:01:49,858 --> 00:01:52,255
- Go get Minwoo right away.
- Calm down, Sir.

27
00:01:52,414 --> 00:01:55,362
Just because of a damned woman,
he ruins all the work we put into this?

28
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:58,687
I'm not going to let him 
get away with this.

29
00:02:01,283 --> 00:02:03,333
If Chairman Hwang has recovered,

30
00:02:03,536 --> 00:02:06,395
then the land we sold
could get us in trouble.

31
00:02:07,449 --> 00:02:11,234
Chief Moon, you leave the 
company and lie low for a while.

32
00:02:11,869 --> 00:02:17,487
Once I become chairman,
then you can come back.

33
00:03:01,108 --> 00:03:03,541
So I hear Chairman 
Hwang Taeseop has come back?!

34
00:03:03,772 --> 00:03:06,603
Are we finally waking up?

35
00:03:08,553 --> 00:03:09,895
It's all thanks to you.

36
00:03:09,997 --> 00:03:14,863
With his return, he made
all our efforts useless.

37
00:03:14,979 --> 00:03:19,483
Even the secret fund we
gathered will do us no good.

38
00:03:20,643 --> 00:03:22,371
You don't need to worry.

39
00:03:22,617 --> 00:03:27,633
I'll become chairman of
Manbo Construction as planned.

40
00:03:27,954 --> 00:03:30,589
Do you have any plan?

41
00:03:33,221 --> 00:03:40,203
It's really a relief that you were
handling the president's secret fund.

42
00:03:40,714 --> 00:03:43,518
If you need any help, just tell me.

43
00:03:43,662 --> 00:03:48,609
Manbo Construction's
term drafts will soon be up.

44
00:03:48,725 --> 00:03:51,541
Help me make sure 
their checks start bouncing.

45
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:54,530
Want to force them 
to file for bankruptcy?

46
00:03:55,209 --> 00:04:01,433
If we resume construction on those
Songpa apartments when I become chairman,

47
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:05,226
we'll easily deal with
that amount of bad debt.

48
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,785
All right.

49
00:04:07,276 --> 00:04:12,071
You should have gotten
a hold of yourself a lot earlier.

50
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:14,670
Don't get any illusions.

51
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:16,981
Because it's not for you,

52
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:19,667
but all for my sake.

53
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:22,853
And...

54
00:04:24,021 --> 00:04:26,001
for Miju as well.

55
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:31,330
You still have feelings for that...

56
00:04:31,388 --> 00:04:32,876
I'll find her.

57
00:04:32,991 --> 00:04:35,619
Even if I have to search
the entire world to do so,

58
00:04:36,472 --> 00:04:39,025
I will find her.

59
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:41,514
Fine.

60
00:04:41,817 --> 00:04:45,211
I'll be waiting for good news.

61
00:04:57,504 --> 00:05:00,840
If you hadn't done that at the end, 
we wouldn't be here.

62
00:05:00,956 --> 00:05:02,660
You should have been more careful...

63
00:05:02,732 --> 00:05:04,118
<i>I did all I could...</i>

64
00:05:04,191 --> 00:05:07,281
Forget it, forget it.
What shall we do when we're out?

65
00:05:07,368 --> 00:05:10,564
- I know this nice place...
- Can't you keep quiet?

66
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,314
- What's with her?
- What?!

67
00:05:13,467 --> 00:05:15,478
What did this old broad just say?

68
00:05:15,637 --> 00:05:17,153
Shut your mouth.

69
00:05:17,312 --> 00:05:20,388
Did you rent the damned place?
Ignorant brats...

70
00:05:20,533 --> 00:05:21,645
Ignorant?!

71
00:05:21,731 --> 00:05:24,823
Should I give you a taste
of how ignorant my fists are?

72
00:05:24,881 --> 00:05:27,971
Ahh... What...
What is wrong with you?

73
00:05:28,159 --> 00:05:31,105
I mean...
Let's be honest...

74
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:34,513
You should show some etiquette
and respect public morality.

75
00:05:34,615 --> 00:05:35,813
<i>Etiquette?!</i>

76
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,814
Why, was respecting etiquette 
what got you here?

77
00:05:43,247 --> 00:05:45,941
Enough with all this commotion!

78
00:05:50,115 --> 00:05:53,090
<i>Oh Namsuk, come out.
You have a visit.</i>

79
00:05:53,993 --> 00:05:55,675
Uh?

80
00:06:18,182 --> 00:06:19,610
You...

81
00:06:20,563 --> 00:06:23,452
I fell for your tricks 
hook, line and sinker, didn't I?

82
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:26,658
You brought all this upon yourself.

83
00:06:26,947 --> 00:06:28,925
You still refuse to admit your faults?

84
00:06:29,084 --> 00:06:31,179
I got myself a lawyer.

85
00:06:31,497 --> 00:06:34,197
And once the investigation
is over, I'll be out.

86
00:06:35,396 --> 00:06:40,884
He says the worst they can give me 
for forging that document is a fine?!

87
00:06:46,371 --> 00:06:48,350
It's a divorce application.

88
00:06:48,537 --> 00:06:50,227
What?

89
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:53,780
Divorce?!

90
00:06:53,939 --> 00:06:58,675
Dad says he wants to 
break off this marriage.

91
00:07:03,109 --> 00:07:04,727
Fine.

92
00:07:05,911 --> 00:07:08,872
What will he give me as alimony?

93
00:07:09,016 --> 00:07:11,486
The house in your name,

94
00:07:11,659 --> 00:07:13,955
and the company shares you still have.

95
00:07:14,128 --> 00:07:17,854
<i>If this were up to me, I would
have even gone through a lawsuit...</i>

96
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:20,748
to take away everything you have 
down to the last penny,

97
00:07:21,022 --> 00:07:24,301
but looks like my father 
thought otherwise.

98
00:07:25,572 --> 00:07:30,944
Once you're out, 
divorce procedures will begin.

99
00:07:32,013 --> 00:07:36,994
I've already lost all interest myself.

100
00:07:37,931 --> 00:07:40,402
So he's asking for a divorce?

101
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,373
It's exactly what I wanted.

102
00:07:45,023 --> 00:07:48,085
Thank you for settling it so quickly.

103
00:07:58,457 --> 00:08:00,884
Fine...

104
00:08:02,205 --> 00:08:04,248
All the better.

105
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:10,776
It's much better this way.

106
00:08:27,969 --> 00:08:30,667
Thank... you.

107
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:34,032

108
00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:36,443
<i>Thanks.</i>

109
00:08:38,061 --> 00:08:39,637
<i>Dad!</i>

110
00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:44,229
They told us a hospital in the
States could help you fully recover.

111
00:08:44,855 --> 00:08:47,016
Is that really true?

112
00:08:47,262 --> 00:08:48,244
Yes.

113
00:08:48,417 --> 00:08:52,114
The doctor says he'll recommend
him to a specialist clinic.

114
00:08:53,318 --> 00:08:55,378
I will escort you there.

115
00:08:55,552 --> 00:08:58,565
Let me come with you, Chairman.

116

Gangmo...

120
00:09:47,584 --> 00:09:49,377
What?

121
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,813
Lee Gangmo...

122
00:09:57,726 --> 00:10:00,708
Building the foundations was
more problematic than I expected,

123
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:07,640
but now that I got it all settled,
everything will go smoothly from now on.

124
00:10:07,756 --> 00:10:10,441
Solid foundations are the key
behind a strong and reliable building.

125
00:10:10,557 --> 00:10:12,968
Don't worry too much about
deadlines and focus on quality first.

126
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:15,214
Yes.

127
00:10:16,319 --> 00:10:18,636
<i>Quick... Get moving.</i>

128
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:21,799
Aigoo... You!
You'll end up falling again!

129
00:10:21,944 --> 00:10:24,630
Why can't you lift this?

130
00:10:24,731 --> 00:10:26,522
Aigoo... Really...

131
00:10:26,579 --> 00:10:28,991
I'll help you out with it.

132
00:10:29,092 --> 00:10:30,551
Wh...What?!

133
00:10:30,652 --> 00:10:31,605
But... P...President...

134
00:10:31,721 --> 00:10:35,089
It's all right...
Here, quick...

135
00:10:36,288 --> 00:10:37,764
What...

136
00:10:38,184 --> 00:10:39,006
President.

137
00:10:39,121 --> 00:10:42,385
What are you waiting for?
Even the president is doing it...

138
00:10:42,587 --> 00:10:44,927
Ahh... I'm wearing a suit today...

139
00:10:45,028 --> 00:10:47,570
Director Park, 
what are you doing? Come.

140
00:10:47,656 --> 00:10:49,662
Director, my ass.

141
00:10:49,734 --> 00:10:52,616
I'll get all filthy this way.

142
00:10:56,016 --> 00:10:59,930
Give me the cleanest one...
Not this! That one over there.

143
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,905
I've heard...

144

the chairman's rehab is going well.

145
00:11:29,454 --> 00:11:31,536
And how did you find out?

146
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:41,295
I myself was told of my father's 
rehab only recently.

147
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:44,096
Anyhow, congrats.

148
00:11:44,356 --> 00:11:47,721
For protecting his post
and Manbo Construction as well.

149
00:11:50,072 --> 00:11:52,256
I need to go back to the site.

150
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:54,958
What did you want to talk about?

151

No... No need to know.

Dad will soon leave for the States.

We found him, Hyung.

166
00:13:51,738 --> 00:13:53,717
Dad...

167
00:14:03,285 --> 00:14:05,812
Dad...

168
00:14:09,526 --> 00:14:11,979
Dad!

169
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:23,892
Dad...

170
00:14:25,018 --> 00:14:27,632
You were here?

171
00:14:31,135 --> 00:14:32,658
I'm...

172
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,998
your favorite pest, Gangmo.

173
00:14:40,331 --> 00:14:42,428
<i>Dad...</i>

174
00:15:39,862 --> 00:15:41,515
Dad.

175
00:15:43,912 --> 00:15:49,862
Remember what you told me, 
right before you died?

176
00:15:57,013 --> 00:15:59,947
You said that to protect one's family,

177
00:16:00,554 --> 00:16:03,500
the most important thing is courage.

178
00:16:05,718 --> 00:16:07,948
I'm sorry, Dad.

179
00:16:11,383 --> 00:16:13,072
I...

180
00:16:16,712 --> 00:16:19,196
couldn't protect Mom.

181
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:27,427
<i>And I had to send our
youngest Junmo to a foster family.</i>

182
00:16:29,006 --> 00:16:31,457
I deserve all the blame.

183
00:16:36,339 --> 00:16:41,653
Scold me for it, Dad!

184
00:16:42,317 --> 00:16:45,075
<i>It wasn't Gangmo's fault, Dad.</i>

185
00:16:45,277 --> 00:16:47,544
I'm the only one to blame.

186
00:16:47,703 --> 00:16:50,794
It was all because of me, Dad...

187
00:16:52,406 --> 00:16:56,585
I apologize, Dad...
It's all my fault...

188
00:16:57,032 --> 00:17:00,470
Dad...

189
00:17:03,123 --> 00:17:05,368
Dad...

190
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:18,017
I wish Miju could have learned of this.

191
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:21,512
We'll have to take her along next time.

192
00:17:22,306 --> 00:17:24,775
Dad will love to see her.

193
00:17:25,093 --> 00:17:29,325
So Chairman Hwang took care of
Dad's graveyard all this time?

194
00:17:29,584 --> 00:17:34,838
On the day he was assaulted, 
I got a call from him.

195
00:17:35,525 --> 00:17:38,007
He said I'd get to meet
a very welcome person.

196
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:40,895
There is nothing that will
earn him my forgiveness,

197
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:43,957
after what he did to our father.

198
00:17:44,462 --> 00:17:50,019
For my sake, Jeongyeon
put everything on the line.

199
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,398
She gave up her family,

200
00:17:54,467 --> 00:17:57,283
her ambitions and everything else.

201
00:17:58,929 --> 00:18:04,388
Just to be together, she was
following me into the pits of hell.

202
00:18:04,489 --> 00:18:07,134
- Gangmo...
- And the same person,

203
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:16,666
is now being devoured by her
desire to get revenge against me.

204
00:18:20,673 --> 00:18:23,265
The one responsible for that...

205
00:18:26,412 --> 00:18:28,247
is none other than me.

206
00:18:29,951 --> 00:18:34,240
<i>I know we must 
avenge our father, Hyung.</i>

207
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:39,634
But I... I...

208
00:18:39,721 --> 00:18:41,844
<i>No need to say it.</i>

209
00:18:42,392 --> 00:18:46,811
You just forget about revenge.

210
00:18:48,688 --> 00:18:53,834
Just focus on making
Hangang Construction succeed.

211
00:18:57,081 --> 00:18:59,553
You have every right to do so, Gangmo.

212
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:18,125
Dad...

213
00:19:18,645 --> 00:19:21,129
Let me ask you just one thing.

214
00:19:21,809 --> 00:19:26,689
Was Gangmo the one
who's been looking after you?

215
00:19:28,769 --> 00:19:34,112
All this time, was he 
the one who took care of you?

216
00:19:39,673 --> 00:19:41,795
Jeongyeon.

217
00:19:42,734 --> 00:19:48,232
You... misunderstood.

218
00:19:50,028 --> 00:19:55,005
Gangmo saved my life.

219
00:19:55,539 --> 00:19:59,364
What's that supposed to mean?

220
00:19:59,725 --> 00:20:02,021
Are you telling me that...

221
00:20:03,104 --> 00:20:06,021
he wasn't the one who assaulted you?

222
00:20:08,621 --> 00:20:16,470
And the only reason we were 
able to protect our company...

223
00:20:16,847 --> 00:20:21,037
was thanks to Gangmo's help.

224
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,294
Before I leave for the States,

225
00:20:26,612 --> 00:20:31,045
I want to see Gangmo.

226
00:20:54,367 --> 00:20:57,039
<i>The man who did that to my father...</i>

227
00:20:57,617 --> 00:21:01,704
<i>Lee Gangmo, I know it was you.</i>

228
00:21:02,021 --> 00:21:05,585
You're free to think whatever you want.

229
00:21:06,105 --> 00:21:10,033
Since my goal is and will always be
defeating Manbo Construction.

230
00:21:10,148 --> 00:21:14,033
Hand Hangang Construction to me.

231
00:21:14,235 --> 00:21:17,470
Do you know what my dream is?

232
00:21:18,409 --> 00:21:21,288
And you want to trample on that?

233
00:21:24,133 --> 00:21:26,328
Because...

234
00:21:27,397 --> 00:21:31,354
the sole fact that someone
like you shares my same dream...

235
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:34,346
is too hard to bear.

236
00:21:37,638 --> 00:21:39,819
<i>Gangmo...</i>

237
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:45,697
<i>How could we end up like this?</i>

238
00:21:47,045 --> 00:21:49,206
<i>It's so foolish.</i>

239
00:21:52,986 --> 00:21:55,485
<i>Why didn't you...</i>

240
00:21:56,716 --> 00:21:59,572
<i>just hate me all the way?</i>

241
00:22:01,709 --> 00:22:04,092
<i>Then, at least,</i>

242
00:22:05,016 --> 00:22:08,889
<i>I could have pretended 
to hate you as well.</i>

243
00:22:12,485 --> 00:22:15,648
I'm sorry, Gangmo...

244
00:22:18,464 --> 00:22:21,078
I'm sorry.

245
00:22:29,789 --> 00:22:33,486
What do we do now?

246
00:22:40,796 --> 00:22:44,926
What can we do, Gangmo?

247
00:23:21,192 --> 00:23:22,818
Eonni!

248
00:23:25,317 --> 00:23:27,396
<i>Ahh... I'm so hungry!</i>

249
00:23:27,541 --> 00:23:29,467
Let's go have lunch, shall we?

250
00:23:30,307 --> 00:23:33,101
<i>- Get moving!
- Why? Can't we stay here?</i>

251
00:23:38,257 --> 00:23:42,734
Dad wants to see you.

252
00:23:42,979 --> 00:23:44,250
I have no reason to see him.

253
00:23:44,351 --> 00:23:47,185
I've heard everything from him.

254
00:23:51,201 --> 00:23:56,862
<i>I'll neither say thank you, 
nor that I'm sorry.</i>

255
00:23:57,627 --> 00:24:02,335
<i>Because it would only
make it worse for you.</i>

256
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:08,455
- I don't know what he told you, but...
- Don't you worry.

257
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:12,730
I'll never let Jo Pilyeon and his son...

258
00:24:14,434 --> 00:24:17,813
take Manbo Construction away from me.

259
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:20,961
<i>Isn't that what you wish for?</i>

260
00:24:22,304 --> 00:24:25,929
For me to get the
company back on its feet,

261
00:24:28,765 --> 00:24:32,110
and compete with you fair and square.

262
00:24:44,947 --> 00:24:49,395
Dad... Gangmo is here.

263
00:25:00,724 --> 00:25:02,708
Gangmo.

264
00:25:05,107 --> 00:25:07,039
I...

265
00:25:09,106 --> 00:25:11,198
I'm sorry.

266
00:25:12,368 --> 00:25:16,758
I apologize.

267
00:25:17,553 --> 00:25:23,800
Can you forgive me for what I did?

268
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:31,396
Your father...

269
00:25:31,642 --> 00:25:33,678
Daesoo.

270
00:25:36,538 --> 00:25:38,326
That fool...

271
00:25:39,597 --> 00:25:42,368
was like a brother to me.

272
00:25:44,658 --> 00:25:50,614
I let Jo Pilyeon deceive me,

273
00:25:51,812 --> 00:25:58,202
and just stared while he
was killing my dearest friend.

274
00:25:59,154 --> 00:26:05,513
If to pay for what I did...

275
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:13,200
I'll have to spend the
rest of my days in this state,

276
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:16,183
I will have no complaints.

277
00:26:21,547 --> 00:26:23,497
Gangmo.

278
00:26:24,848 --> 00:26:28,759
If you don't... No.

279
00:26:29,666 --> 00:26:32,676
If I don't earn your forgiveness,

280
00:26:33,052 --> 00:26:37,163
my life will no 
longer have any meaning.

281
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:40,488
Please...

282
00:26:41,251 --> 00:26:43,566
Please forgive me,

283
00:26:43,883 --> 00:26:45,974
Gangmo.

284
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:50,684
<i>Gangmo...</i>

285
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:02,864
Gangmo...

286
00:27:16,026 --> 00:27:18,234
Go to the States...

287
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:24,314
and come back fully recovered.

288
00:27:27,758 --> 00:27:29,800
Thanks...

289
00:27:31,315 --> 00:27:33,688
Thank you!

290
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:17,255
It's all over for me now.

291
00:28:17,502 --> 00:28:19,675
I'm done.

292
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:21,906
Jeongshik.

293
00:28:22,693 --> 00:28:26,041
You don't know how things are
going on in the company, right?

294
00:28:27,298 --> 00:28:31,614
Couldn't care less about that anymore.

295
00:28:32,014 --> 00:28:34,422
Manbo Construction...

296
00:28:34,986 --> 00:28:37,229
will soon file for
preliminary bankruptcy.

297
00:28:37,874 --> 00:28:39,191
What?!

298
00:28:40,038 --> 00:28:41,667
Bankruptcy?!

299
00:28:41,808 --> 00:28:45,144
Their main bank will
soon turn its back on them.

300
00:28:45,426 --> 00:28:50,512
In no time, our company shares 
will be worth nothing.

301
00:28:50,782 --> 00:28:51,945
Minwoo...

302
00:28:52,157 --> 00:28:53,355
Then...

303
00:28:53,789 --> 00:28:54,899
What should we do?

304
00:28:55,016 --> 00:28:57,494
Before stock prices get any worse,

305
00:28:57,835 --> 00:28:59,644
sell all the shares 
you and your mother have left.

306
00:28:59,855 --> 00:29:02,252
Sell our shares?!

307
00:29:03,086 --> 00:29:07,209
Not long ago, I had
a meeting with the boys.

308
00:29:08,073 --> 00:29:10,650
Geosan Auto, Daeyang Trading,

309
00:29:10,827 --> 00:29:13,047
Hanguk Group, Dongguk Bank.

310
00:29:13,928 --> 00:29:16,183
They're all sons of tycoons.

311
00:29:16,608 --> 00:29:19,883
Why, did they promise
they'd buy our shares?

312
00:29:20,235 --> 00:29:22,349
They told me they'll invest in us.

313
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:24,499
I'll buy those shares for them.

314
00:29:25,122 --> 00:29:27,201
You... You're not telling me...

315
00:29:27,389 --> 00:29:31,077
this is all to get your hands on
Manbo Construction, are you?

316
00:29:31,194 --> 00:29:33,638
Haven't you just heard the
company is about to go belly up?

317
00:29:33,755 --> 00:29:36,346
I'm putting everything on the line here!

318
00:29:37,042 --> 00:29:42,090
And they merely got fooled
into investing thanks to me.

319
00:29:43,969 --> 00:29:49,449
Ever since I joined the company,
I've given my all for its sake.

320
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:53,044
It's my last resort to make sure...

321
00:29:53,502 --> 00:29:56,298
Manbo Construction doesn't disintegrate.

322
00:29:57,792 --> 00:30:00,792
After preliminary bankruptcy,
there will be a second and third filing...

323
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:03,341
By then, there will be no hope.

324
00:30:03,884 --> 00:30:06,889
So before things get worse,
talk with your mother,

325
00:30:07,499 --> 00:30:10,166
and I really suggest
you sell those shares.

326
00:30:24,833 --> 00:30:25,914
Chairman.

327
00:30:26,019 --> 00:30:28,621
I wish you a full recovery, Sir.

328
00:30:29,795 --> 00:30:31,757
Thank you.

329
00:30:31,957 --> 00:30:34,494
Get back to us as
strong as ever, Chairman.

330
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:37,665
Chairman Hwang... Fighting.

331
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:39,568
All right.

332
00:30:39,791 --> 00:30:42,501
We'll be waiting for you, Chairman.

333
00:30:43,573 --> 00:30:45,650
No need to come to the airport.

334
00:30:45,786 --> 00:30:49,798
No... I'll see Dad out.

335
00:30:50,585 --> 00:30:52,148
Director!

336
00:30:52,289 --> 00:30:53,427
Director.

337
00:30:53,545 --> 00:30:55,506
What's the matter?

338
00:31:01,708 --> 00:31:03,764
What is it about?

339
00:31:04,272 --> 00:31:05,808
It's nothing...

340
00:31:06,078 --> 00:31:10,405
Just like you said,
I'd better let you two go.

341
00:31:10,569 --> 00:31:13,412
<i>I'll leave Dad to your care.</i>

342
00:31:13,576 --> 00:31:16,019
Don't you worry, Jeongyeon.

343
00:31:20,585 --> 00:31:22,265
Dad.

344
00:31:22,406 --> 00:31:24,873
Don't worry about the company,

345
00:31:25,624 --> 00:31:29,818
and come back to us fully recovered.

346
00:31:32,915 --> 00:31:35,151
All right.

347
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:47,344
We wish you the best, Chairman.

348
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:59,148
What do you mean...
Our checks are bouncing?!

349
00:31:59,218 --> 00:32:03,294
Our main lender Goryeo Bank
has refused any loan extensions.

350
00:32:03,601 --> 00:32:04,563
And why, all of a sudden?

351
00:32:04,645 --> 00:32:06,219
We don't know the details yet,

352
00:32:06,325 --> 00:32:08,639
but we suspect it might be
because the construction was halted.

353
00:32:08,768 --> 00:32:09,990
Get the car.

354
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:11,669
I must meet the 
bank president right away.

355
00:32:11,787 --> 00:32:12,705
Yes, Director.

356
00:32:12,834 --> 00:32:15,771
Before that,
deal with today's drafts.

357
00:32:15,877 --> 00:32:17,627
All right, Director.

358
00:32:21,726 --> 00:32:23,164
<i>President!</i>

359
00:32:23,305 --> 00:32:24,632
What is going on?

360
00:32:24,761 --> 00:32:27,169
Why are our checks bouncing?

361
00:32:27,287 --> 00:32:30,922
Don't you know what's happening with
your company better than anyone?

362
00:32:31,037 --> 00:32:33,518
- President!
- I'm busy now.

363
00:32:33,671 --> 00:32:35,527
President...

364
00:32:36,302 --> 00:32:38,640
President! Just a moment...

365
00:32:38,769 --> 00:32:40,449
Give me just a moment...

366
00:32:40,601 --> 00:32:44,231
Once they learned their main
bank turned its back on them,

367
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:48,118
<i>everyone else started 
bouncing their checks.</i>

368
00:32:49,316 --> 00:32:50,949
<i>If this keeps up,</i>

369
00:32:51,066 --> 00:32:54,802
they'll soon be filing
for preliminary bankruptcy.

370
00:32:54,943 --> 00:32:59,863
And Manbo Construction's
stocks will continue to crash.

371
00:33:00,615 --> 00:33:04,949
Jo Minwoo is not going
to lose this opportunity.

372
00:33:06,382 --> 00:33:08,297
Keep any buying trends in check.

373
00:33:08,426 --> 00:33:10,951
All right.

374
00:33:17,651 --> 00:33:21,116
I apologize, I'm a little late.

375
00:33:21,269 --> 00:33:23,183
Don't even mention it, President.

376
00:33:23,348 --> 00:33:24,464
Ahh... Let me introduce them.

377
00:33:24,616 --> 00:33:26,985
These are my investors.

378
00:33:27,137 --> 00:33:28,688
Is Chairman Lee doing well?

379
00:33:28,805 --> 00:33:30,156
Yes.

380
00:33:31,577 --> 00:33:33,222
You already knew each other?

381
00:33:33,433 --> 00:33:34,937
We sure do.

382
00:33:35,818 --> 00:33:39,095
Here's the second heir of Geosan Auto.

383
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:41,770
And here is Daeyang Trading's.

384
00:33:42,287 --> 00:33:45,341
I see you've chosen quite the investors.

385
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:48,877
Then, I'll get straight to the point.

386
00:33:49,288 --> 00:33:53,746
We'd like some tips regarding
a takeover of Manbo Construction.

387
00:33:53,969 --> 00:33:58,367
Are you planning to
take over the company?

388
00:33:58,738 --> 00:34:00,359
Of course.

389
00:34:07,142 --> 00:34:08,340
Sir...

390
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:13,027
- Hwang Jeongyeon...
- Is she still here?

391
00:34:13,191 --> 00:34:15,177
Please give me your help, Sir.

392
00:34:15,318 --> 00:34:18,821
I'm not engaging in charity.

393
00:34:18,926 --> 00:34:20,453
You may leave.

394
00:34:20,618 --> 00:34:24,177
Once the construction resumes,
everything will go back to normal.

395
00:34:24,247 --> 00:34:25,786
- If you could only help us until...
- Gyeongok.

396
00:34:25,951 --> 00:34:27,807
Our guest is leaving.

397
00:34:27,959 --> 00:34:29,498
But, Sir...

398
00:34:30,273 --> 00:34:32,977
Are you deaf as well?

399
00:34:51,596 --> 00:34:54,344
I'll try to convince him.

400
00:34:54,497 --> 00:34:56,752
I'm counting on you.

401
00:34:56,917 --> 00:35:00,279
Someone must be behind all this.

402
00:35:00,384 --> 00:35:05,353
Are you saying that someone
might be orchestrating this?

403
00:35:05,424 --> 00:35:09,958
If such weren't the case,
things wouldn't escalate so quickly.

404
00:35:22,498 --> 00:35:26,812
If only to safeguard our
investment in Manbo Construction,

405
00:35:27,012 --> 00:35:29,631
we can't just sit and stare
while this happens, Sir.

406
00:35:29,843 --> 00:35:32,145
I've already sold them all.

407
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:33,496
What?

408
00:35:33,637 --> 00:35:37,805
A few days ago,
I got a call from the bank.

409
00:35:37,946 --> 00:35:42,175
Knowing this would happen,
I already sold all our shares.

410
00:35:43,831 --> 00:35:45,346
Sir...

411
00:35:46,709 --> 00:35:49,599
If only for my sake and
everything I've done for you,

412
00:35:49,751 --> 00:35:52,451
help me out just this once.

413
00:35:53,725 --> 00:35:57,572
The reason I could endure
all this time under you...

414
00:35:59,017 --> 00:36:01,989
was the hope that I could
one day help my daughter.

415
00:36:02,095 --> 00:36:04,483
If you really have your
daughter's future at heart,

416
00:36:04,741 --> 00:36:07,020
give up on Manbo Construction.

417
00:36:08,231 --> 00:36:12,987
If what you want is
for your daughter to succeed,

418
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:16,206
throw her into the pits of hell,

419
00:36:16,347 --> 00:36:18,978
and let her escape from
those flames on her own.

420
00:36:19,189 --> 00:36:20,388
Sir...

421
00:36:20,482 --> 00:36:26,343
Think that helping her out this time
would make things any better for her?

422
00:36:26,554 --> 00:36:31,537
You shouldn't catch fish for her,
but just teach her how to fish!

423
00:36:35,703 --> 00:36:37,888
If I'm not mistaken about her,

424
00:36:38,017 --> 00:36:42,903
that Jeongyeon will only get
stronger when put under pressure.

425
00:36:43,061 --> 00:36:48,594
I have no intention of
helping Manbo Construction.

426
00:36:48,852 --> 00:36:51,613
And I'm not sure I like that cheap
compassion you're throwing at her feet...

427
00:36:51,683 --> 00:36:54,185
just because you're her mother!

428
00:36:54,432 --> 00:36:57,404
If I made myself clear,

429
00:36:57,721 --> 00:37:00,153
then you may leave.

430
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:12,857
Yes.

431
00:37:12,998 --> 00:37:14,642
<i>It's me, Jeongshik.</i>

432
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:18,178
Have you talked it out 
with your mother?

433
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:21,666
All right.

434
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,585
You made the right decision.

435
00:37:23,902 --> 00:37:26,734
Let's meet at the Hangang
Hotel coffeehouse tomorrow.

436
00:37:27,181 --> 00:37:29,483
Don't forget your seal.

437
00:37:34,874 --> 00:37:36,496
Chief Moon.

438
00:37:38,326 --> 00:37:41,098
Looks like we might need to
use our secret fund very soon.

439
00:37:41,203 --> 00:37:42,472
Get the money ready.

440
00:37:42,589 --> 00:37:45,267
Yes, all right.

441
00:37:50,917 --> 00:37:53,567
Here... Let's have a drink.

442
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,395
But, tell me.

443
00:38:00,501 --> 00:38:03,237
Work must be killing you these days,

444
00:38:03,343 --> 00:38:07,614
I'm sure you didn't gather us all
here just for a few tasty bites?

445
00:38:07,954 --> 00:38:11,842
Actually, I have a
favor to ask you all.

446
00:38:11,925 --> 00:38:13,428
See, what did I tell you?

447
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:16,751
Personal favors, all right!

448
00:38:17,093 --> 00:38:22,060
Help Manbo Construction
resume its apartment project.

449
00:38:24,048 --> 00:38:27,687
Ahh... President Lee,
again with that favor?

450
00:38:27,886 --> 00:38:32,623
I see witnessing Chairman Hwang
being assaulted made you weak.

451
00:38:32,741 --> 00:38:38,097
Manbo Construction's collapse
would damage the entire sector.

452
00:38:38,414 --> 00:38:39,612
I'll be counting on you.

453
00:38:39,683 --> 00:38:43,653
Aigoo... Looks like you
haven't heard the news.

454
00:38:44,343 --> 00:38:49,053
Manbo Construction filed for
preliminary bankruptcy today.

455
00:38:50,298 --> 00:38:52,389
<i>According to the news
coming from the bank,</i>

456
00:38:52,471 --> 00:38:56,653
it looks like Chief Jo Minwoo
will soon begin a takeover.

457
00:38:56,759 --> 00:38:57,936
Then, what?

458
00:38:58,053 --> 00:39:03,680
Jo Pilyeon interfered with the construction
to put his son in charge of the company?

459
00:39:03,774 --> 00:39:08,366
<i>That's the only plausible explanation.</i>

460
00:39:10,464 --> 00:39:13,424
<i>Hey... The meat will burn.</i>

461
00:39:14,329 --> 00:39:19,039
There are people willing to
invest in Manbo Construction.

462
00:39:19,192 --> 00:39:20,049
What?!

463
00:39:20,155 --> 00:39:24,549
They came here with me,
would you like to meet them?

464
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:28,214
Tell them to come in.

465
00:39:44,339 --> 00:39:46,860
You've met them before, right?

466
00:39:48,058 --> 00:39:50,655
<i>They're my investors.</i>

467
00:39:57,738 --> 00:40:00,205
<i>That'll be enough to
cover tomorrow's drafts.</i>

468
00:40:00,381 --> 00:40:07,124
What they're asking for is Chairman
Hwang's unconditional resignation,

469
00:40:07,618 --> 00:40:12,128
including forfeiting all the
company shares in his possession.

470
00:40:12,704 --> 00:40:15,605
<i>Of course, 
the vacant post of chairman...</i>

471
00:40:15,804 --> 00:40:22,253
will be entrusted to me,
considering my 30-percent holdings.

472
00:40:23,903 --> 00:40:27,915
It's one of their conditions as well.

473
00:40:28,338 --> 00:40:30,406
Thirty percent?!

474
00:40:31,982 --> 00:40:36,702
You're telling me you had almost
one-third of all company shares?

475
00:40:36,831 --> 00:40:39,063
Just a check and
you'll find out for yourself.

476
00:40:40,649 --> 00:40:43,667
Will you accept our conditions?

477
00:40:47,649 --> 00:40:50,762
Take until tomorrow to
decide, and let us know.

478
00:40:51,161 --> 00:40:53,299
We'll be waiting.

479
00:41:10,578 --> 00:41:12,623
Jo Minwoo!

480
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,532
Go ahead first.

481
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:31,141
I thought there wasn't
anything left to say?!

482
00:41:31,247 --> 00:41:33,350
I am well aware...

483
00:41:33,502 --> 00:41:39,118
that the ones stopping our
apartment construction...

484
00:41:39,411 --> 00:41:41,420
are you and your father.

485
00:41:41,703 --> 00:41:43,440
Hwang Jeongyeon.

486
00:41:44,838 --> 00:41:47,927
This is all you can do.

487
00:41:48,143 --> 00:41:49,271
What?

488
00:41:49,412 --> 00:41:54,827
You can neither 
beat me nor Lee Gangmo.

489
00:41:55,931 --> 00:42:00,007
Before you resent us for that,
blame your own capabilities.

490
00:42:00,148 --> 00:42:01,772
It's not...

491
00:42:04,288 --> 00:42:05,965
It's not over yet.

492
00:42:06,083 --> 00:42:09,513
Can you find 
five billion won by tomorrow?

493
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,498
Ahh...

494
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:14,410
4.5 billion the day after,

495
00:42:14,814 --> 00:42:16,815
and after that...

496
00:42:20,123 --> 00:42:22,583
End of the line, I'm afraid.

497
00:42:23,213 --> 00:42:28,691
The only thing left is for you 
to get out of the picture.

498
00:42:41,647 --> 00:42:43,696
No...

499
00:42:46,515 --> 00:42:48,291
No way...

500
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,621
I'm not done yet.

501
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,819
You won't take it from me.

502
00:43:01,392 --> 00:43:03,554
I won't let you.

503
00:43:09,886 --> 00:43:11,935
I'm not losing to you.

504
00:43:17,129 --> 00:43:20,946
By tomorrow, Manbo Construction
will fall into Jo Minwoo's hands.

505
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:23,361
Are you just going to take it lying down?

506
00:43:25,015 --> 00:43:28,270
You're the only one
who can save Jeongyeon.

507
00:43:28,336 --> 00:43:30,028
You know that.

508
00:43:31,033 --> 00:43:32,396
Baekpa opposes it.

509
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,952
You gave birth to Jeongyeon!

510
00:43:37,122 --> 00:43:39,252
You're...

511
00:43:40,643 --> 00:43:45,314
the mother she spent
all that time looking for.

512
00:43:47,719 --> 00:43:49,460
Is that...

513
00:43:50,268 --> 00:43:52,449
Is that not enough for you?

514
00:43:57,990 --> 00:44:00,880
If he opposes it,
there is nothing I can do!

515
00:44:00,993 --> 00:44:06,208
I'll pledge Hangang Construction 
to him as collateral.

516
00:44:07,702 --> 00:44:11,132
Use that to save Jeongyeon.

517
00:44:11,216 --> 00:44:13,518
Go tell him yourself.

518
00:44:13,678 --> 00:44:16,336
He'll probably kick you out 
without blinking once!

519
00:44:20,014 --> 00:44:22,529
I'll take care of Jeongyeon.

520
00:44:24,671 --> 00:44:26,405
Lee Gangmo.

521
00:44:26,602 --> 00:44:30,098
You have no right or need to do this!

522
00:44:32,983 --> 00:44:36,343
Yes, you're right.

523
00:44:38,702 --> 00:44:44,584
To Jeongyeon, I mean nothing.

524
00:44:58,823 --> 00:45:00,458
What's this...

525
00:45:01,153 --> 00:45:04,094
Did you come here looking for me?

526
00:45:07,966 --> 00:45:10,356
So the company is going bankrupt?

527
00:45:10,431 --> 00:45:13,635
Is there anything
you don't know about me?

528
00:45:16,144 --> 00:45:17,845
Don't know if I like that?

529
00:45:17,986 --> 00:45:20,213
I'll only have 
three of these and leave.

530
00:45:21,764 --> 00:45:28,163
Should I explain to you the reason,
or tell you a way to get out of it?

531
00:45:31,894 --> 00:45:33,281
All right.

532
00:45:33,488 --> 00:45:35,753
The both of them would be better.

533
00:45:38,337 --> 00:45:41,887
You used to play in the dirt
back when you were little, right?

534
00:45:42,141 --> 00:45:43,222
And?

535
00:45:43,297 --> 00:45:47,037
The stronger your grip on that mud,

536
00:45:47,121 --> 00:45:53,691
the easier that desire will make 
all the mud fall out of your hands.

537
00:45:55,289 --> 00:45:57,901
That's the reason you failed.

538
00:45:58,869 --> 00:46:00,626
From the very start,

539
00:46:01,490 --> 00:46:07,608
you had a far too strong grip
on things which weren't yours,

540
00:46:08,115 --> 00:46:10,690
things which never suited you.

541
00:46:11,907 --> 00:46:18,288
You should just let go 
of all that instead.

542
00:46:19,018 --> 00:46:21,163
You want me...

543
00:46:22,676 --> 00:46:24,186
to give up on Manbo Construction?

544
00:46:24,271 --> 00:46:25,521
That's right.

545
00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:32,033
If you get hold of something else, 
you'll make something much bigger out of it.

546
00:46:32,155 --> 00:46:34,232
So never look back.

547
00:46:37,342 --> 00:46:39,175
Only one left.

548
00:46:42,125 --> 00:46:44,733
Shall I let you in 
on what you could do?

549
00:46:49,526 --> 00:46:51,527
Grow stronger.

550
00:46:53,104 --> 00:46:55,111
They won't steal it from you,

551
00:46:55,497 --> 00:46:57,583
you will let them have it.

552
00:46:58,776 --> 00:47:01,650
Let those greedy beasts have it.

553
00:47:03,473 --> 00:47:09,356
Keep your chin up, and look 
at them straight in the eyes.

554
00:47:10,117 --> 00:47:11,593
And...

555
00:47:12,693 --> 00:47:15,267
proudly bid them farewell.

556
00:47:15,963 --> 00:47:18,594
<i>Just like someone who
rid herself of all her burdens.</i>

557
00:47:19,637 --> 00:47:21,989
Now matter how wronged
or angry you feel,

558
00:47:22,299 --> 00:47:24,808
don't give them the
pleasure of a single tear.

559
00:47:26,522 --> 00:47:29,776
I know how all that feels.

560
00:47:31,657 --> 00:47:33,813
How some things 
are taken away from you,

561
00:47:34,177 --> 00:47:37,301
but others are just given away.

562
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:55,779
I've had my three shots,

563
00:47:56,084 --> 00:47:58,246
so I guess it's time to go?!

564
00:48:01,142 --> 00:48:06,569
It's not the end for you,

565
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:10,257
you're starting anew.

566
00:48:13,697 --> 00:48:15,212
Ours...

567
00:48:17,690 --> 00:48:19,946
Ours is an ill-fated relationship.

568
00:48:22,888 --> 00:48:26,363
Just thought you were
forgetting that for a minute.

569
00:48:55,697 --> 00:48:57,635
How are you?

570
00:48:57,928 --> 00:49:00,301
Good morning.

571
00:49:01,962 --> 00:49:04,177
<i>{\a6}- Manbo Construction Takeover Ceremony -</i>

571
00:49:01,962 --> 00:49:04,177
Without further ado,

572
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:09,551
I ask Hwang Jeongyeon and Jo Minwoo
to sign the takeover agreement.

573
00:49:09,739 --> 00:49:13,780
<i>First, Miss Hwang Jeongyeon.</i>

574
00:50:00,042 --> 00:50:04,435
Mister Jo Minwoo as well.

575
00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:15,559
<i>With company shareholders 
bearing witness,</i>

576
00:50:15,641 --> 00:50:19,905
<i>both sides have signed
the takeover agreement.</i>

577
00:50:20,093 --> 00:50:24,381
Miss Hwang Jeongyeon will
now give her farewell speech.

578
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:46,309
I...

579
00:50:48,106 --> 00:50:54,558
pride myself on having done my very best
for Manbo Construction's development.

580
00:50:56,234 --> 00:50:58,717
I might be leaving this company,

581
00:50:58,905 --> 00:51:04,778
but on behalf of my father,
former chairman Hwang Taeseop...

582
00:51:15,394 --> 00:51:24,298
I believe this place he devoted
his passion and youth for...

583
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:32,631
will be protected by the new chairman
and you shareholders to the very end.

584
00:51:34,323 --> 00:51:39,473
I enjoyed this experience.

585
00:52:33,941 --> 00:52:39,121
Our Manbo Construction has had to
suffer plenty of difficulties over time.

586
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:41,106
<i>You have my word.</i>

587
00:52:41,270 --> 00:52:44,090
Not only we will become
top of the sector at home,

588
00:52:44,243 --> 00:52:47,214
but to truly make
this a global corporation,

589
00:52:47,402 --> 00:52:50,304
I will spare no effort.

590
00:53:05,692 --> 00:53:10,878
<i>Enjoy this ovation 
while it lasts, Jo Minwoo.</i>

591
00:53:11,231 --> 00:53:19,441
<i>As in the end, it will turn into the most
painful grief you'll ever experience.</i>

592
00:53:39,348 --> 00:53:43,553
Congratulations!

593
00:53:49,467 --> 00:53:52,313
This is just the beginning.

594
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:57,219
This Hwang Taeseop 
and his Manbo Construction...

595
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:01,960
are going to reach the very top
of the construction business.

596
00:54:13,135 --> 00:54:15,571
<i>Dad...</i>

597
00:54:16,792 --> 00:54:18,801
I'm sorry.

598
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:27,904
I lost Manbo Construction.

599
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:34,459
<i>Your dream of a lifetime...</i>

600
00:54:35,364 --> 00:54:38,194
was ruined because of me.

601
00:54:43,511 --> 00:54:46,460
I'm sorry, Dad...

602
00:55:32,693 --> 00:55:37,111
You really looked great
at the farewell speech today.

603
00:55:39,542 --> 00:55:43,877
What do you plan to do from now on?

604
00:55:44,781 --> 00:55:46,953
I don't know.

605
00:55:48,581 --> 00:55:53,666
Nothing really comes to mind.

606
00:55:57,361 --> 00:56:02,733
What do you think 
a 100-won bill could buy you?

607
00:56:04,824 --> 00:56:07,362
Know how much a bus token costs?

608
00:56:07,502 --> 00:56:12,436
Never bought fish at
the market before, have you?

609
00:56:13,797 --> 00:56:16,041
People who dealt with
tens of billions at once...

610
00:56:16,135 --> 00:56:18,778
would never understand how scary 
ten, a hundred won can be.

611
00:56:18,907 --> 00:56:21,197
They might make ten billion 
through a corporation,

612
00:56:21,303 --> 00:56:24,451
but couldn't possibly earn even
a thousand won on their own.

613
00:56:25,203 --> 00:56:29,704
You know what they call a mountain of
coins devouring those ten billions?

614
00:56:30,773 --> 00:56:34,649
That's private lending.

615
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:39,806
- Private...
- If you're interested, come look for me.

616
00:56:40,424 --> 00:56:44,054
But there is something
you must bear in mind first.

617
00:56:45,722 --> 00:56:49,927
The fact that you must completely abandon 
your past life as a chairman's daughter...

618
00:56:50,491 --> 00:56:54,426
from head to toe.

619
00:56:55,877 --> 00:56:58,196
Stand at the very bottom,

620
00:56:58,373 --> 00:57:01,544
and a cloud of dust will assault you.

621
00:57:02,472 --> 00:57:05,138
Once you've gone through all that,

622
00:57:06,518 --> 00:57:09,326
<i>that's when you'll finally 
earn your first coin.</i>

623
00:57:10,594 --> 00:57:12,850
If you're not prepared 
to go through that,

624
00:57:13,378 --> 00:57:15,669
don't even bother looking for me.

01:00:57,239 --> 01:01:03,158
<i>It's to make up for those things
that I didn't die and recovered.</i>

650
01:01:03,275 --> 01:01:05,225
<i>Gyeongok.</i>

651
01:01:17,083 --> 01:01:19,291
Congrats on your promotion, Hyung.

652
01:01:19,914 --> 01:01:25,799
That's that, 
but I'm worried about Miju.

653
01:01:26,339 --> 01:01:31,600
We should have 
stopped her when we could.

654
01:01:32,846 --> 01:01:39,036
If I only think of all the hardships 
she must be going through with that baby...

655
01:01:40,387 --> 01:01:43,101
Our Miju is smart,

656
01:01:43,277 --> 01:01:45,309
so everything will be fine.

657
01:01:46,307 --> 01:01:48,598
We'll soon find her, Gangmo.

658
01:01:52,014 --> 01:01:54,847
It's been four years already, four!

659
01:01:55,082 --> 01:01:57,089
Manbo Construction's chairman 
is searching for someone,

660
01:01:57,124 --> 01:01:58,886
do I really need to wait all this long?

661
01:01:58,992 --> 01:02:00,342
I apologize, Chairman.

662
01:02:00,472 --> 01:02:03,443
Even asking for 
the police's cooperation...

663
01:02:03,584 --> 01:02:06,239
If it doesn't work, 
get me the damned Chief of Police.

664
01:02:06,368 --> 01:02:09,502
Even if they have to search all over 
this country, they must find her!

665
01:02:09,690 --> 01:02:11,957
All right, Chairman.

666
01:02:18,993 --> 01:02:20,919
Lee Miju...

667
01:02:21,025 --> 01:02:23,159
You really...

668
01:02:25,978 --> 01:02:27,388
Miju...

669
01:02:28,292 --> 01:02:31,476
Please, show up before me.

670
01:02:39,766 --> 01:02:43,537
- Come on in, Deputy.
- Long time no see.

671
01:02:44,841 --> 01:02:48,034
Ahh... That's nice.

672
01:02:48,673 --> 01:02:50,505
When did you take over this place?

673
01:02:50,599 --> 01:02:53,636
Looks like you were the
only one who didn't know?

674
01:02:54,006 --> 01:02:56,003
Let's have a seat.

675
01:02:57,624 --> 01:03:00,857
Aigoo... Girls, there's no time.

676
01:03:01,858 --> 01:03:03,444
Hey... She's still not here?

677
01:03:03,549 --> 01:03:05,018
N...No... Not yet.

678
01:03:05,111 --> 01:03:06,838
How can a replacement be so late?

679
01:03:06,932 --> 01:03:08,835
Who introduced her to us?

680
01:03:08,917 --> 01:03:12,676
She's here!
Our replacement is here.

681
01:03:12,735 --> 01:03:15,119
Really? There's no time, 
so get her changed right away.

682
01:03:15,225 --> 01:03:17,821
- Hurry and send her up!
- Yes!

683
01:03:36,814 --> 01:03:44,306
<i>We thank all our esteemed guests for
gracing our Bagdad with their presence.</i>

684
01:03:44,471 --> 01:03:46,385
Tonight's opening act...

685
01:03:46,632 --> 01:03:49,204
is famous star...

686
01:03:49,286 --> 01:03:51,236
Nabi!

687
01:03:51,413 --> 01:03:55,941
Or at least that was the case until
something came up, and she couldn't come.

688
01:03:56,436 --> 01:04:03,895
But let me introduce a great newcomer
who will stir up the scene like no other!

689
01:04:04,060 --> 01:04:07,126
Give her an applause!

I think it's time to make
her go through a little test.

696
01:04:48,185 --> 01:04:50,863
<i>About that new singer 
we saw last time...</i>

697
01:04:50,957 --> 01:04:52,564
She really left an impression.

698
01:04:52,648 --> 01:04:55,779
Isn't the area full of rocky mountains?

699
01:04:55,854 --> 01:04:57,188
<i>And who's going to do it?</i>

700
01:04:57,273 --> 01:04:59,218
<i>Let's just throw 
everything we have at it.</i>

701
01:04:59,312 --> 01:05:02,000
<i>If we go for it to the end, 
we'll find a way.</i>
