Episode 52

4
00:00:12,934 --> 00:00:15,614
Ga... Gangmo.

5
00:00:18,747 --> 00:00:20,311
This will save us.

6
00:00:20,421 --> 00:00:25,886
With this, we can
develop a great boiler, Gangmo.

7
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:44,257
With the new technology I brought you,

8
00:00:44,384 --> 00:00:48,880
you won't have to worry about
being excluded from the New City project.

9
00:00:49,081 --> 00:00:51,739
Actually, when combined with
Beaute's existing technology,

10
00:00:51,911 --> 00:00:56,925
you might even improve upon the original.

11
00:00:57,319 --> 00:00:59,150
Will you be all right?

12
00:01:00,724 --> 00:01:03,099
I certainly appreciate all this help,

13
00:01:03,398 --> 00:01:06,768
but what you just committed was a crime.

14
00:01:11,883 --> 00:01:13,529
To be perfectly honest...

15
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,218
I was too embarrassed to face my own son.

16
00:01:16,919 --> 00:01:20,110
You practically saved Minsoo's life,

17
00:01:21,025 --> 00:01:24,693
and I just couldn't ignore all the
difficulties you were going through.

18
00:01:26,063 --> 00:01:30,902
It was as big a crime as stealing Beaute's
core technology and bringing it to them.

19
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,024
I am solely responsible for all
this, so you needn't feel guilty.

20
00:01:36,389 --> 00:01:38,651
Let's do this.

21
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:46,362
We'll make even cheaper and better
boilers with the technology you brought us.

22
00:01:46,591 --> 00:01:49,524
I think that the benefit
people will gain from this...

23
00:01:49,911 --> 00:01:54,068
will help you forgive
yourself for what you did.

24
00:01:55,813 --> 00:01:59,618
I can only thank you for
being so understanding, President.

25
00:02:19,303 --> 00:02:20,720
Wooju.

26
00:02:20,924 --> 00:02:22,723
Ajeosshi!

27
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,419
Has our Wooju been doing well?

28
00:02:26,505 --> 00:02:27,835
Yes.

29
00:02:29,442 --> 00:02:32,098
- You told the rector, right?
- Yes, Chairman.

30
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,989
I bought you at least two hours.

31
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,222
Wooju, did you have lunch?

32
00:02:40,454 --> 00:02:42,171
I'm hungry, too...

33
00:02:42,359 --> 00:02:44,471
Shall we go have lunch together?

34
00:02:46,002 --> 00:02:48,606
Here... Let's go.

35
00:02:50,366 --> 00:02:51,024
You little...

36
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:53,256
Keep that up and I'll just drop you.

37
00:03:00,145 --> 00:03:03,544
When will the results from Chicago be ready?

38
00:03:03,653 --> 00:03:06,324
In about three days, I think.

39
00:03:07,797 --> 00:03:09,409
Let's go back to the office.

40
00:03:09,505 --> 00:03:10,845
Aren't you meeting with Minwoo?

41
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:12,418
Just let him be.

42
00:03:12,633 --> 00:03:16,461
He doesn't have too much
time left to spend with his kid.

43
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,378
All right, Congressman.

44
00:03:24,988 --> 00:03:26,418
Here...

45
00:03:30,052 --> 00:03:32,457
- Is it good?
- Yes.

46
00:03:54,555 --> 00:03:57,159
Here. Have this.

47
00:03:58,618 --> 00:04:00,135
Why?

48
00:04:00,411 --> 00:04:01,565
You don't like this?

49
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:04,580
I don't like fish.

50
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:08,043
Then, this?

51
00:04:11,018 --> 00:04:12,362
How about this.

52
00:04:12,483 --> 00:04:14,352
I like that.

53
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:16,770
And this?

54
00:04:19,611 --> 00:04:20,992
It's incredible.

55
00:04:21,096 --> 00:04:24,401
How could you have
the same exact tastes...

56
00:04:24,558 --> 00:04:27,620
Ajeosshi, give me this.

57
00:04:27,792 --> 00:04:29,165
That?

58
00:04:38,872 --> 00:04:40,375
Wooju.

59
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,737
Try to call me "Daddy."

60
00:04:46,055 --> 00:04:48,011
Just once.

61
00:04:48,172 --> 00:04:49,253
Here...

62
00:04:49,402 --> 00:04:51,300
Daddy.

63
00:04:52,531 --> 00:04:54,634
Or else, I won't give you this.

64
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:56,437
You want it, don't you?

65
00:04:57,021 --> 00:04:58,706
So go ahead.

66
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,472
Daddy...

67
00:05:00,577 --> 00:05:02,689
Daddy.

68
00:05:05,851 --> 00:05:08,407
That's right. Good boy.

69
00:05:15,932 --> 00:05:20,127
When we meet, don't call me Ajeosshi.

70
00:05:20,233 --> 00:05:21,667
Just use Daddy.

71
00:05:21,776 --> 00:05:23,747
You can do that, right?

72
00:05:26,136 --> 00:05:28,797
Then, I won't come see you again?!

73
00:05:29,212 --> 00:05:31,416
So you'll call me Daddy?

74
00:05:36,008 --> 00:05:38,701
Here... Promise.

75
00:05:39,265 --> 00:05:41,076
Seal.

76
00:06:09,841 --> 00:06:11,276
Want a drink?

77
00:06:11,373 --> 00:06:14,634
No... Let me pour you one.

78
00:06:18,507 --> 00:06:22,184
Your face's a mess.

79
00:06:22,942 --> 00:06:28,670
So, tell me, why did you start working
under that loan shark, Noh Gapsoo?

80
00:06:28,813 --> 00:06:32,154
I had some debts to settle so I
went asking for a job,

81
00:06:32,538 --> 00:06:35,674
but I was kicked out because of Jeongyeon.

82
00:06:35,831 --> 00:06:39,365
After she stole all the investors from him....

83
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:41,898
Dad.

84
00:06:42,008 --> 00:06:44,099
If I don't pay back those forty million,

85
00:06:44,225 --> 00:06:45,979
they'll kill me, Dad.

86
00:06:46,065 --> 00:06:47,968
You pathetic twat...

87
00:06:48,168 --> 00:06:53,333
So why disgrace yourself
becoming a gambling addict?

88
00:06:53,474 --> 00:06:55,980
I want a better life, too.

89
00:06:57,997 --> 00:07:03,080
I wanted to finally turn the
page before Mom died...

90
00:07:03,538 --> 00:07:06,986
But now I really don't
know how I'm going to go on.

91
00:07:10,056 --> 00:07:13,822
If you could only
give me those forty million,

92
00:07:13,946 --> 00:07:16,174
I'll really wake up once and for all, Dad.

93
00:07:16,285 --> 00:07:17,844
I mean it.

94
00:07:18,016 --> 00:07:25,284
If I pay your debts,
will you follow your father?

95
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:26,424
What?

96
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:32,074
Don't you ever gamble again,
and just work under me.

97
00:07:32,198 --> 00:07:36,691
But you're getting allowance
from Jeongyeon's mother...

98
00:07:36,797 --> 00:07:38,958
Ohh Ohh, you little...

99
00:07:40,372 --> 00:07:44,689
I will soon enter politics.

100
00:07:44,802 --> 00:07:47,216
Po... Politics?!

101
00:07:47,387 --> 00:07:48,900
Are you running for congress?

102
00:07:49,017 --> 00:07:52,852
Learn how the world
goes 'round under my wings,

103
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:55,585
and make acquaintance with
some decent people, for a change.

104
00:07:55,714 --> 00:08:01,258
It still beats wasting your life
away on the poker table, you fool.

105
00:08:02,986 --> 00:08:04,375
Thank you, Dad.

106
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,327
I will work hard...
I'll do my very best.

107
00:08:08,548 --> 00:08:11,785
Dad, let me pour you a drink.

108
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:20,841
I wonder...

109
00:08:22,572 --> 00:08:29,639
how your mother could leave
you behind and just go like that...

110
00:08:43,698 --> 00:08:46,017
Just giving them products that
do indeed work would be quite the start.

111
00:08:46,074 --> 00:08:48,721
Of course, President!

112
00:08:51,157 --> 00:08:52,231
Director Yang.

113
00:08:52,341 --> 00:08:53,443
You've already been discharged?

114
00:08:53,569 --> 00:08:57,495
After hearing the news, I
was just itching to come back.

115
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:59,055
Where is the experiment report?

116
00:08:59,126 --> 00:09:01,902
Told you that nothing
can stop our Director Yang.

117
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:05,293
We have a meeting with
New City businessmen today.

118
00:09:05,407 --> 00:09:07,980
Since you're here, check the paperwork
we'll have to present to City Hall.

119
00:09:08,052 --> 00:09:10,512
I'll just follow you.

120
00:09:11,027 --> 00:09:12,930
Will it be all right?

121
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:18,553
This should more than suffice.

122
00:09:19,068 --> 00:09:20,971
Have you heard any
news of Hangang Construction?

123
00:09:21,071 --> 00:09:22,869
They had a major
accident just a few days ago,

124
00:09:22,969 --> 00:09:26,747
so I doubt they will have made any progress.

125
00:09:34,744 --> 00:09:35,989
It is time, Chairman.

126
00:09:36,103 --> 00:09:38,143
Let's head to City Hall.

127
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:46,733
I read you claiming
in an interview with the press...

128
00:09:46,858 --> 00:09:50,805
that you found the
cause of those accidents, right?

129
00:09:50,977 --> 00:09:52,599
So what was the problem?

130
00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:56,941
I'm afraid I can't answer
that in a competitor's presence.

131
00:09:57,103 --> 00:09:59,092
Gas was the problem.

132
00:10:00,665 --> 00:10:03,552
Beaute Boilers'
products had no defects,

133
00:10:03,655 --> 00:10:09,436
but the gas used in Europe
and Korea is different.

134
00:10:09,836 --> 00:10:12,548
Yes... It can certainly be because of that.

135
00:10:12,659 --> 00:10:15,467
And how will you solve
the over-heating problems...

136
00:10:15,652 --> 00:10:18,528
which end up damaging the floor pipes?

137
00:10:19,271 --> 00:10:24,543
By using an expansion tank,
we've already solved the issue.

138
00:10:24,751 --> 00:10:28,224
And we also filed a request
for a patent as well.

139
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:32,873
I hear Manbo Construction's
expansion tank is an open circuit type.

140
00:10:34,733 --> 00:10:37,150
Ours is closed circuit instead.

141
00:10:38,681 --> 00:10:41,549
As you're well aware,
because of the influx of oxygen,

142
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:44,261
open circuit systems often
suffer from pipe corrosion issues.

143
00:10:44,332 --> 00:10:48,380
Also, because of overflow, heat loss
in the pipe system is significant.

144
00:10:48,504 --> 00:10:52,423
In consideration of such flaws, we
developed a closed circuit system instead.

145
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:54,463
Our patent will soon be ready as well.

146
00:10:54,563 --> 00:10:59,442
Are you aware that closed circuit systems
cost thrice the usual open circuit ones?

147
00:10:59,551 --> 00:11:01,096
I obviously am well aware of that.

148
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:04,735
But whereas an open circuit
system can last ten years,

149
00:11:04,821 --> 00:11:07,997
closed circuit ones are semipermanent.

150
00:11:09,917 --> 00:11:15,239
I see both sides have made great progress.

151
00:11:16,412 --> 00:11:18,186
So how about we do this?

152
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:27,537
I think a collaboration would
benefit both sides in this case?

153
00:11:29,483 --> 00:11:30,785
Chairman Jo.

154
00:11:31,043 --> 00:11:32,674
How do you feel about that?

155
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:39,684
- We will discuss it with our board...
- We will have to decline.

156
00:11:40,254 --> 00:11:43,557
I really see no reason
why we should join forces.

157
00:11:43,665 --> 00:11:45,569
Yes... Fine, then.

158
00:11:45,662 --> 00:11:48,798
Let's discuss this matter at a later time.

159
00:11:48,895 --> 00:11:51,249
Here... Let's call it a day.

160
00:11:51,433 --> 00:11:52,825
Thank you for your time.

161
00:11:52,917 --> 00:11:55,496
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

162
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:59,517
Let's have a word.

163
00:12:01,996 --> 00:12:07,275
I'm prepared to establish a
partnership for this New City project.

164
00:12:08,921 --> 00:12:10,981
What is the real motive?

165
00:12:11,539 --> 00:12:13,656
Because it would not only help us cut costs,

166
00:12:13,828 --> 00:12:16,198
but it would also help the both
of us in terms of research and development.

167
00:12:16,312 --> 00:12:20,388
If it's all because of Miju,
I suggest you stop day-dreaming.

168
00:12:21,152 --> 00:12:23,852
Think I haven't
figured you out by now?

169
00:12:24,181 --> 00:12:29,146
You'd do anything
to gain what you want.

170
00:12:29,405 --> 00:12:31,577
To be perfectly honest,

171
00:12:32,229 --> 00:12:35,354
I would never even dream
of asking you to forgive me,

172
00:12:36,284 --> 00:12:39,375
if it weren't for Miju.

173
00:12:40,032 --> 00:12:43,008
- So?
- If it's for Miju's sake,

174
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:46,198
there is nothing I can't do.

175
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,756
If you want me to beg,

176
00:12:49,829 --> 00:12:52,604
I can kneel down right now and do it.

177
00:12:55,795 --> 00:12:57,211
Fine...

178
00:12:57,521 --> 00:12:59,572
If you want that,

179
00:12:59,801 --> 00:13:03,439
I will convince my father
to ask for forgiveness...

180
00:13:03,525 --> 00:13:06,129
Cut the crap, Jo Minwoo!

181
00:13:07,903 --> 00:13:13,711
If you felt even the slightest bit of
guilt for what you did to my family,

182
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:19,755
you would never,
ever approach Miju again.

183
00:13:20,084 --> 00:13:22,115
I thought I told you back then?!

184
00:13:22,258 --> 00:13:26,050
That if I saw you hang around
Miju again, I'd kill you.

185
00:13:27,338 --> 00:13:29,340
You better....

186
00:13:31,037 --> 00:13:32,974
You better keep that in mind.

187
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:36,445
Have you ever considered the fact...

188
00:13:38,104 --> 00:13:41,175
that this grudge of yours
will only make Miju unhappy?

189
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:42,725
What?

190
00:13:43,567 --> 00:13:45,216
You have time, so give it a thought.

191
00:13:45,315 --> 00:13:47,332
I need no time.

192
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:53,473
Because I have no intention of
forgiving you and your father.

193
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,207
What brings you here at this hour?

194
00:14:13,313 --> 00:14:16,076
Ohh... Director Yoo.

195
00:14:19,911 --> 00:14:23,951
We were going to meet with
Congressman Oh this evening.

196
00:14:24,047 --> 00:14:25,031
What are you doing?

197
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:27,137
Pay your respects.

198
00:14:29,984 --> 00:14:32,430
How have you been, Director Yoo?

199
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:37,635
I've decided to take him under my wings.

200
00:14:37,757 --> 00:14:42,363
Although we'll have to
see if he can earn his keep.

201
00:14:45,067 --> 00:14:46,083
No way.

202
00:14:46,255 --> 00:14:48,053
Fire him right away.

203
00:14:48,272 --> 00:14:49,660
Gyeongok...

204
00:14:49,975 --> 00:14:51,777
Hwang Jeongshik was working for Noh Gapsoo.

205
00:14:51,906 --> 00:14:54,138
And President Noh is a
close confidant of Jo Pilyeon.

206
00:14:54,524 --> 00:14:58,078
Do you even realize
how much he resents us?

207
00:14:58,335 --> 00:15:01,507
Accepting that kid again is like
digging your own grave.

208
00:15:01,641 --> 00:15:03,335
I know...

209
00:15:03,701 --> 00:15:06,665
- I know that.
- You do... and still go ahead with it?

210
00:15:06,774 --> 00:15:08,585
What else can I do?

211
00:15:08,682 --> 00:15:12,546
No matter how wretched
he might be, he's still my son.

212
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,808
If even I end up abandoning him,

213
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:19,757
that foolish twat will
not be able to go on.

214
00:15:20,673 --> 00:15:25,775
No matter what this will cost me,

215
00:15:27,184 --> 00:15:32,077
how can I abandon
the son I gave life to?

216
00:15:33,422 --> 00:15:39,774
His mother died without
being able to wake him up.

217
00:15:40,298 --> 00:15:44,793
So I want to make a
decent man out of him.

218
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:49,206
Then, just promise this.

219
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:53,784
That you'll never let your guard down.

220
00:15:55,196 --> 00:15:57,976
Because if anything happens to you, I...

221
00:15:58,984 --> 00:16:00,658
I know.

222
00:16:02,686 --> 00:16:04,278
I do.

223
00:16:05,234 --> 00:16:10,358
I know what you mean, so don't worry.

224
00:16:36,786 --> 00:16:38,845
So what he ordered us...

225
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:41,576
is to get blood on my hands, isn't it?

226
00:16:41,653 --> 00:16:45,600
If you have a problem with that,
I can do it on your behalf.

227
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:50,284
Your role is to assist me.

228
00:16:50,544 --> 00:16:53,448
Don't even think of abusing your authority.

229
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:04,353
Ailing companies?!

230
00:17:04,446 --> 00:17:07,823
Are you telling me the government
will oust those ailing companies?

231
00:17:07,929 --> 00:17:10,104
Of course they're only "ailing" on paper,

232
00:17:10,261 --> 00:17:12,536
isn't he just getting rid of
everyone who refused to listen?

233
00:17:12,651 --> 00:17:17,618
There's already a hit list
with several big names on it.

234
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:20,453
Is Jo Pilyeon getting involved?

235
00:17:20,576 --> 00:17:22,156
I will make the final decision,

236
00:17:22,281 --> 00:17:25,320
but as far as selecting the candidates goes,

237
00:17:25,492 --> 00:17:27,769
I think I'll be forced to let Jo Pilyeon help me.

238
00:17:27,878 --> 00:17:30,943
He's the man who collected secret
funds from corporations on his behalf,

239
00:17:31,086 --> 00:17:35,143
so I'm sure he's got the president's
full confidence in that sense.

240
00:17:35,367 --> 00:17:37,203
This is serious.

241
00:17:37,547 --> 00:17:42,998
He's likely going to take this
opportunity to eliminate all his rivals...

242
00:17:43,484 --> 00:17:47,548
Now that you mention it, he actually
volunteered to do the dirty work.

243
00:17:47,659 --> 00:17:51,027
I categorically refused,

244
00:17:51,152 --> 00:17:55,143
but Jo Pilyeon is never one
to be underestimated.

245
00:17:57,532 --> 00:18:02,245
Things in the financial world are about
to get heated beyond any imagination.

246
00:18:02,374 --> 00:18:04,991
I might only be holding half the blade,

247
00:18:05,098 --> 00:18:09,498
but think of the benefits having
been entrusted this will bring us.

248
00:18:09,623 --> 00:18:12,098
Are there already any confirmed names?

249
00:18:12,269 --> 00:18:13,843
International Group.

250
00:18:14,553 --> 00:18:18,722
They clearly fell on the president's bad side.

251
00:18:18,982 --> 00:18:20,839
Guess they had it coming.

252
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:25,380
They'll probably vanish
without leaving a trace.

253
00:18:30,104 --> 00:18:37,329
And Hangang Construction
will soon join that list.

254
00:18:38,188 --> 00:18:42,304
Lee Gangmo has earned
Oh Byeongtak's confidence.

255
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:46,224
Can you really let something
you should have the monopoly on...

256
00:18:46,324 --> 00:18:48,985
to someone like Lee Gangmo?

257
00:18:49,157 --> 00:18:51,203
But you said you won't be the
only one with decisional power.

258
00:18:51,303 --> 00:18:55,374
That is why you must take a step forward.

259
00:18:56,590 --> 00:19:00,038
Start by making sure he doesn't
complete that boiler he's developing.

260
00:19:00,167 --> 00:19:04,344
I will only be able to go at him
if he loses Oh Byeongtak's confidence.

261
00:19:04,974 --> 00:19:06,233
That's right...

262
00:19:07,163 --> 00:19:11,953
Why don't you just set his factory on fire?

263
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:15,630
Are you trying to limit him...

264
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,420
fearing he might try to get revenge?

265
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:19,751
Revenge?!

266
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:25,345
I'm well aware of who
killed Lee Gangmo's father.

267
00:19:27,685 --> 00:19:29,445
Minwoo!

268
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:31,917
What the hell are you saying?

269
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:37,986
How many more people must
die to satisfy that greed of yours?

270
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:42,436
Have you already forgotten the days
when you wanted to kill him as well?

271
00:19:42,565 --> 00:19:47,674
And you realize how much I despise
myself for even thinking that?

272
00:19:47,767 --> 00:19:49,104
What?!

273
00:19:49,325 --> 00:19:52,637
I will bear the consequences
of my sins on my own.

274
00:19:53,254 --> 00:19:55,556
And stop committing sins as well.

275
00:19:55,739 --> 00:20:01,275
Just witnessing all you do makes me sick.

276
00:20:03,752 --> 00:20:05,739
- Stop there!
- Calm down, Sir!

277
00:20:05,854 --> 00:20:07,399
Sir.

278
00:20:07,728 --> 00:20:10,648
That fool must be crazy.
He's out of his mind.

279
00:20:10,761 --> 00:20:15,174
I think that Wooju made him weak.

280
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:17,613
But he'll soon get a hold
of himself, Congressman.

281
00:20:17,756 --> 00:20:20,041
Are things in the US proceeding well?

282
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:22,319
Yes, you don't need to worry.

283
00:20:22,428 --> 00:20:25,828
Those results must be
a wake up call for him.

284
00:20:25,935 --> 00:20:27,928
Enough to cry bitter tears of regret.

285
00:20:28,072 --> 00:20:29,889
Let's just go.

286
00:20:30,003 --> 00:20:32,449
What is that Lee Miju doing, these days?

287
00:20:32,592 --> 00:20:37,084
She's shooting a promotional
video for the Olympics.

288
00:20:37,242 --> 00:20:38,286
What?!

289
00:20:38,472 --> 00:20:40,747
And whose decision was that?

290
00:20:42,678 --> 00:20:46,986
I saw the dailies of the promotional video.

291
00:20:47,096 --> 00:20:48,992
It was really nice.

292
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:51,896
I think it will be of great help to the city.

293
00:20:52,037 --> 00:20:54,468
Thank you, Deputy.

294
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:57,404
By the way...

295
00:20:58,263 --> 00:21:02,598
These days it's so
hard to see you on TV...

296
00:21:03,777 --> 00:21:07,411
It's not like I watch TV
all that often, anyway.

297
00:21:07,511 --> 00:21:09,213
Soojeong was banned from appearing on TV.

298
00:21:09,328 --> 00:21:10,844
Seonhwa!

299
00:21:11,402 --> 00:21:13,720
What is that supposed to mean?

300
00:21:14,507 --> 00:21:16,011
It's nothing, Deputy.

301
00:21:16,181 --> 00:21:17,487
Tell me.

302
00:21:17,769 --> 00:21:20,084
Did you just say she was banned?

303
00:21:20,172 --> 00:21:23,060
That matter will soon be settled.
Don't worry about it.

304
00:21:23,216 --> 00:21:26,337
It's not like there were any problematic lyrics...

305
00:21:26,587 --> 00:21:30,798
There looks to be no
reason why they'd ban you?!

306
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:32,573
Yes.

307
00:21:35,228 --> 00:21:35,915
Deputy.

308
00:21:36,015 --> 00:21:38,762
Congressman Jo Pilyeon is here.

309
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,482
How have you been, Deputy?

310
00:21:42,596 --> 00:21:46,387
Aigoo, what brings you here, Congressman Jo?

311
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:50,899
I'll get going, Deputy.

312
00:21:51,056 --> 00:21:52,483
Ohh... Sure.

313
00:21:52,634 --> 00:21:55,162
- Mister Hong, escort them out.
- Yes.

314
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,378
It's all right.

315
00:21:56,479 --> 00:21:58,510
I'll see you next time.

316
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,681
Here, have a seat.

317
00:22:17,491 --> 00:22:24,718
So you want me to choose another
honorary ambassador instead of Cha Soojeong,

318
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:26,485
is that it?

319
00:22:26,607 --> 00:22:28,496
With the Olympics around the corner,

320
00:22:28,609 --> 00:22:32,645
what would be the point
of using someone like her?

321
00:22:34,094 --> 00:22:36,658
I thought you were busy these days.

322
00:22:37,141 --> 00:22:40,476
You still have time to involve
yourself in such matters?

323
00:22:40,603 --> 00:22:42,598
Let me ask you one thing.

324
00:22:42,724 --> 00:22:45,711
Who chose Cha Soojeong?

325
00:22:45,816 --> 00:22:48,143
So I'll ask you something as well.

326
00:22:48,989 --> 00:22:51,726
Soojeong being banned from TV...

327
00:22:52,348 --> 00:22:53,934
Were you behind that?

328
00:22:54,087 --> 00:22:58,271
I see that brat brought that up.

329
00:22:58,529 --> 00:23:00,691
What on earth is going
on between you two, to...

330
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:03,369
That's exactly what I'd like to ask you.

331
00:23:04,579 --> 00:23:07,581
I really can't figure out why
someone like you would waste time...

332
00:23:07,663 --> 00:23:10,526
trying to interfere with a singer's career.

333
00:23:10,667 --> 00:23:14,318
So? Does that mean you
refuse to make any changes?

334
00:23:14,443 --> 00:23:16,778
City administration is under my jurisdiction.

335
00:23:17,142 --> 00:23:19,985
So I don't really see any
reason why you should interfere.

336
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:21,481
Look, Deputy!

337
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:24,317
- For something so insignificant...
- Exactly because it's insignificant,

338
00:23:24,441 --> 00:23:26,718
I'm afraid I can't help you.

339
00:23:29,925 --> 00:23:32,627
I must ask you to leave now.

340
00:23:41,243 --> 00:23:43,455
- I'll order later.
- Sure.

341
00:23:45,488 --> 00:23:49,808
Chairman Choi has been showing
interest in my business venture.

342
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,146
Here's the contract.

343
00:23:52,253 --> 00:23:55,062
So if you'd like to decide
the sum you'll invest...

344
00:23:55,162 --> 00:23:58,868
You're just as beautiful as my father said.

345
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,303
Excuse me?

346
00:24:00,418 --> 00:24:04,578
Have you heard my explanation?

347
00:24:04,825 --> 00:24:08,477
I majored in business
administration at Harvard.

348
00:24:08,618 --> 00:24:12,695
And I've been in management here for two years.

349
00:24:13,762 --> 00:24:18,112
To be perfectly honest, all that
talk of investment sounds like French to me,

350
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:20,403
but I do like you.

351
00:24:21,671 --> 00:24:23,609
Hand me that contract.

352
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:31,384
I invested great pride and
passion in this business of mine.

353
00:24:32,077 --> 00:24:35,272
So I'd rather not change
my investors on a whim.

354
00:24:37,328 --> 00:24:39,679
Look, Miss Hwang Jeongyeon.

355
00:24:40,137 --> 00:24:44,123
- I majored in...
- You told me about Harvard already.

356
00:24:44,244 --> 00:24:46,997
And that you've been
back in Korea for two years.

357
00:24:48,265 --> 00:24:49,722
You don't have much in the way of manners.

358
00:24:49,804 --> 00:24:53,225
I will give Chairman Choi a call.

359
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:55,715
It was a pleasure meeting you.

360
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,682
Mister Choi?

361
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:08,411
The exit is that way, actually.

362
00:25:19,513 --> 00:25:21,816
Can you really treat customers that way?

363
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,612
Gangmo!

364
00:25:23,894 --> 00:25:25,713
How did you know I was here?

365
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:28,287
Chairman Cheon and I
were going to meet here.

366
00:25:28,933 --> 00:25:32,393
Then... I guess his daughter will come as well?!

367
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:33,756
Was it Suyeon?

368
00:25:33,842 --> 00:25:37,603
But... Who was that?

369
00:25:38,988 --> 00:25:40,862
The second son of Golden
Group's chairman.

370
00:25:40,955 --> 00:25:46,035
The one Chairman Choi
talked about at the event...

371
00:25:48,196 --> 00:25:50,861
He looked quite... charming?!

372
00:25:50,976 --> 00:25:54,141
For a company called Golden Group,
the heir leaves a lot to be desired.

373
00:25:54,248 --> 00:25:55,420
Really?

374
00:25:55,761 --> 00:25:59,077
{\a6}[*blockhead, idiot]

375
00:25:55,761 --> 00:25:59,077
Then, should we
call them Golbin* Group?

376
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:03,376
Be that as it may,

377
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:06,821
losing that much money just
because of a single word...

378
00:26:06,961 --> 00:26:09,332
I will make it back and more.

379
00:26:09,931 --> 00:26:13,154
He's competing with his older
brother over control of the company.

380
00:26:13,281 --> 00:26:17,724
He'll pay special attention
to what I tell his father.

381
00:26:19,486 --> 00:26:21,812
Hwang Jeongyeon, you're really something?!

382
00:26:21,918 --> 00:26:23,785
My mo...

383
00:26:25,749 --> 00:26:28,263
Director Yoo told me.

384
00:26:29,144 --> 00:26:31,411
That even money has a soul.

385
00:26:32,163 --> 00:26:36,767
To not just look at money itself, but
try to capture the investors' imagination.

386
00:26:38,407 --> 00:26:39,758
Jeongyeon.

387
00:26:40,096 --> 00:26:43,658
There's still some time before my
meeting, shall we eat something?

388
00:26:43,998 --> 00:26:47,839
Nah, I need to meet
another investor right now.

389
00:27:06,864 --> 00:27:09,131
I knew they released you,

390
00:27:10,494 --> 00:27:14,358
but knowing how tight
surveillance would be, I didn't call you.

391
00:27:14,488 --> 00:27:18,943
I know that you're meeting
opposition party members as of late.

392
00:27:20,118 --> 00:27:23,090
They might say this six-man
committee has been formed,

393
00:27:23,712 --> 00:27:27,863
but if you can't secure support
on the ruling party's side,

394
00:27:28,082 --> 00:27:29,832
all your efforts will be in vain.

395
00:27:30,502 --> 00:27:33,490
You must keep pressing Min Honggi.

396
00:27:37,307 --> 00:27:42,734
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

397
00:27:47,456 --> 00:27:50,087
I've heard everything from Gangmo.

398
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:57,987
So you're Daesu's older son?

399
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:07,862
I really have no excuse.

400
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:15,012
But if you could only forgive me just a...

401
00:28:16,046 --> 00:28:17,832
No...

402
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:22,777
You really don't need to forgive me.

403
00:28:23,888 --> 00:28:25,451
However,

404
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:31,077
for fooling me and killing your father,

405
00:28:32,005 --> 00:28:36,709
I must get rid of Jo Pilyeon myself.

406
00:28:38,271 --> 00:28:44,861
That day when my father was killed,

407
00:28:46,364 --> 00:28:48,537
I was there.

408
00:28:52,789 --> 00:28:53,899
Wh...

409
00:28:54,081 --> 00:28:55,314
What?!

410
00:28:56,954 --> 00:28:58,486
So...

411
00:28:59,402 --> 00:29:01,728
inside the truck...

412
00:29:21,004 --> 00:29:22,643
Who's there?

413
00:29:28,978 --> 00:29:30,763
I see.

414
00:29:31,426 --> 00:29:33,171
So that boy...

415
00:29:35,626 --> 00:29:39,244
That boy was you, Seongmo.

416
00:29:42,441 --> 00:29:46,403
You saw that.

417
00:29:46,963 --> 00:29:49,571
Be it the man who killed my father,

418
00:29:51,034 --> 00:29:54,656
or the one who let his friend
fall into the trap that would kill him,

419
00:29:57,029 --> 00:29:59,566
to my eyes you and Jo
Pilyeon are one and the same.

420
00:30:00,491 --> 00:30:02,010
No...

421
00:30:02,832 --> 00:30:04,406
On the contrary,

422
00:30:05,123 --> 00:30:07,342
for allowing my friend to do
something that would kill him,

423
00:30:08,094 --> 00:30:10,398
I'm even worse.

424
00:30:18,573 --> 00:30:21,717
First, I'll destroy Jo Pilyeon.

425
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:26,991
After I'm done with him,

426
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:31,936
I'll decide whether I'll
get my revenge against you,

427
00:30:33,675 --> 00:30:36,414
or just forgive you.

428
00:30:55,567 --> 00:30:56,812
Right.

429
00:30:59,749 --> 00:31:06,074
It must have been
really painful for you.

430
00:31:11,794 --> 00:31:19,161
If avenging your father can help
you get rid of that resentment,

431
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:25,833
then I should just... Fine.

432
00:31:26,407 --> 00:31:31,150
I will just pay the price for my sins.

433
00:31:34,674 --> 00:31:43,642
Only then I will find peace in the afterlife.

434
00:31:55,267 --> 00:31:56,183
What's this?

435
00:31:56,371 --> 00:31:58,016
Is this all you could write?

436
00:31:58,129 --> 00:32:01,327
They spent the entire day out.

437
00:32:01,436 --> 00:32:02,714
Out?!

438
00:32:03,257 --> 00:32:07,214
So Lee Seongmo and Yoo Chanseong
left you here and went out?

439
00:32:07,379 --> 00:32:08,365
Yes.

440
00:32:10,973 --> 00:32:13,025
If this is the kind of reports you'll write,

441
00:32:13,132 --> 00:32:15,401
I could revoke your eligibility!

442
00:32:16,153 --> 00:32:17,409
I will do better.

443
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:19,184
Stick to them at all times.

444
00:32:19,325 --> 00:32:22,004
Who they meet, where and when.

445
00:32:22,157 --> 00:32:24,088
Find out in detail and write it down.

446
00:32:24,307 --> 00:32:25,364
Is that clear?

447
00:32:25,669 --> 00:32:26,902
Yes, Sir.

448
00:32:27,064 --> 00:32:28,476
Leave.

449
00:32:35,965 --> 00:32:38,478
Can we really trust her?

450
00:32:38,596 --> 00:32:40,334
The more gullible, the better.

451
00:32:41,532 --> 00:32:44,856
Or else Lee Seongmo would suspect her.

452
00:32:47,995 --> 00:32:49,653
What are you saying?

453
00:32:49,763 --> 00:32:51,273
Ailing companies to be ousted?

454
00:32:51,414 --> 00:32:53,084
I don't know the details,

455
00:32:53,193 --> 00:32:56,257
but seems like Congressman Oh and
Jo Pilyeon were put in charge of that.

456
00:32:56,363 --> 00:32:58,367
Dig deeper.

457
00:32:59,153 --> 00:33:03,614
And find out if there's
already any company on that list.

458
00:33:03,755 --> 00:33:04,988
All right.

459
00:33:05,502 --> 00:33:09,175
But if Jo Pilyeon has
been put in charge of that,

460
00:33:09,281 --> 00:33:10,682
Hangang Construction...

461
00:33:10,777 --> 00:33:12,320
Quiet.

462
00:33:16,666 --> 00:33:17,920
Hey, newcomer.

463
00:33:18,046 --> 00:33:20,026
How did you know we would be here?

464
00:33:22,234 --> 00:33:23,349
Pour me a drink.

465
00:33:23,458 --> 00:33:28,267
Hey.... Now you even
try to act all bossy with your superior?

466
00:33:28,924 --> 00:33:30,792
Chief Lee.
No...

467
00:33:30,957 --> 00:33:34,705
Because of you, my
report was thrashed, Ajeosshi.

468
00:33:34,833 --> 00:33:36,551
Next time you work outside,

469
00:33:36,671 --> 00:33:39,289
don't even think of leaving me out of it.

470
00:33:42,672 --> 00:33:44,657
Hey.... Ji Yeonsoo.

471
00:33:46,819 --> 00:33:49,379
Why did you even join the ANSP?

472
00:33:49,899 --> 00:33:54,543
The way I see it, a piano
academy would suit you better?!

473
00:33:59,171 --> 00:34:01,650
- I can't play the piano.
- It's not like you're any better with the gun.

474
00:34:01,767 --> 00:34:04,269
I don't like this, either!

475
00:34:04,455 --> 00:34:07,215
My father forced me to do it.

476
00:34:07,326 --> 00:34:10,481
- What's that supposed to mean?
- My father was in the army.

477
00:34:10,745 --> 00:34:14,539
He said he would send one of
his daughters to the army at all cost...

478
00:34:14,657 --> 00:34:17,863
So you came here
to avoid joining the army?

479
00:34:18,028 --> 00:34:20,905
- Yes.
- Poor girl...

480
00:34:22,021 --> 00:34:25,827
So just endure it for a while,
and find yourself someone to marry.

481
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,549
Men here are nothing special.

482
00:34:31,195 --> 00:34:32,053
What?

483
00:34:32,177 --> 00:34:34,874
You two aren't married either, right?

484
00:34:36,582 --> 00:34:38,362
I can see it from a mile away.

485
00:34:38,621 --> 00:34:40,312
You insolent little...

486
00:34:40,371 --> 00:34:43,552
How about another drink, Ajeosshi...

487
00:35:02,828 --> 00:35:05,979
Hey... Walk straight, will you?

488
00:35:06,084 --> 00:35:07,553
Where do you live?

489
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:09,823
Let's go for another round...

490
00:35:09,918 --> 00:35:13,188
What are you saying?!
Just tell me where you live.

491
00:35:14,602 --> 00:35:16,841
The hell are you staring at, you losers?

492
00:35:17,604 --> 00:35:18,763
What?

493
00:35:20,329 --> 00:35:21,093
I apologize.

494
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:22,714
Why... Have a problem with that?

495
00:35:22,796 --> 00:35:24,768
Want some?

496
00:35:24,987 --> 00:35:26,707
I apologize.

497
00:35:27,677 --> 00:35:30,297
Watch it with the drinking, will you?

498
00:35:32,012 --> 00:35:34,944
Ji Yeonsoo! Stand straight!

499
00:35:38,528 --> 00:35:42,327
You can find your way back home, right?

500
00:35:42,856 --> 00:35:46,532
I can do that... for sure.

501
00:35:47,448 --> 00:35:49,210
To the left. Execute.

502
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:50,806
Execute!

503
00:35:55,763 --> 00:35:57,348
Find your house.

504
00:35:57,501 --> 00:35:58,451
Execute.

505
00:35:58,922 --> 00:36:00,990
Execute!

506
00:36:04,075 --> 00:36:07,000
Ehh... Chanseong, you little...

507
00:36:07,267 --> 00:36:10,594
Where the hell did he
run to, leaving me all alone?

508
00:36:22,651 --> 00:36:25,658
Hey... Ji Yeonsoo!

509
00:36:29,545 --> 00:36:31,389
Careful.

510
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:35,771
Chief!

511
00:36:35,865 --> 00:36:38,308
What are you doing here?

512
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:40,651
Thank you.

513
00:36:40,755 --> 00:36:43,415
Thank you.

514
00:38:33,503 --> 00:38:36,968
Ajeosshi?!

515
00:38:42,211 --> 00:38:44,245
What happened?

516
00:38:45,265 --> 00:38:46,969
Where is your house?

517
00:38:49,142 --> 00:38:50,927
That one.

518
00:38:55,351 --> 00:38:56,960
Right under our nose...

519
00:38:57,069 --> 00:38:59,474
I'm sorry...

520
00:39:04,326 --> 00:39:06,118
So go in and sleep, you silly.

521
00:39:06,225 --> 00:39:10,647
If you want, you could
come in for a cup of coffee.

522
00:39:12,597 --> 00:39:14,300
Come here a second.

523
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:27,333
You better wake up starting tomorrow.

524
00:39:27,447 --> 00:39:28,895
Is that clear?

525
00:39:57,457 --> 00:39:59,525
Wooju, see you next time.

526
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,167
Yes.

527
00:40:01,435 --> 00:40:03,403
What did I tell you to call me?

528
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:05,419
Daddy.

529
00:40:06,782 --> 00:40:08,205
Answer me one more time.

530
00:40:08,461 --> 00:40:10,670
Yes, Daddy.

531
00:40:41,459 --> 00:40:43,846
Here are the results of the DNA test.

532
00:41:22,555 --> 00:41:24,199
Chairman...

533
00:41:24,458 --> 00:41:28,353
Wooju is not your son?!

534
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:40,347
I'll call Chicago and ask
them to verify one more time.

535
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:43,960
Don't.

536
00:41:45,228 --> 00:41:47,036
Stop this.

537
00:41:47,683 --> 00:41:52,041
But, considering the time he was born...

538
00:41:52,135 --> 00:41:54,167
I said stop!

539
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:37,651
Congressman.

540
00:42:38,285 --> 00:42:42,352
Seems like Minwoo has really
taken a liking to that boy...

541
00:42:42,679 --> 00:42:44,974
If he's going to be shocked,

542
00:42:45,102 --> 00:42:49,233
better do it so that he'll never forget it.

543
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:52,387
What do you plan to do with that boy?

544
00:42:53,539 --> 00:42:57,271
No matter what, he's still your grandson.

545
00:42:57,396 --> 00:42:59,212
I'll have to take him away from her.

546
00:42:59,905 --> 00:43:00,660
What?

547
00:43:00,765 --> 00:43:05,056
I can't let that lowly tramp raise
my precious flesh and blood.

548
00:43:05,279 --> 00:43:10,002
I'll have to find the right
opportunity and take him from her.

549
00:43:21,896 --> 00:43:24,093
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

550
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:39,804
I apologize, we're done for today.

551
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:42,460
Come again, we'll sign it next time.

552
00:43:42,542 --> 00:43:44,762
I'm sorry.

553
00:43:49,408 --> 00:43:51,446
Don't make a scene here and just leave.

554
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:54,558
- Come in my car and let's talk.
- Seonhwa, let's go to the office.

555
00:43:56,162 --> 00:43:57,801
Come to my car.

556
00:44:22,674 --> 00:44:27,424
On our way here,
I had all sorts of thoughts.

557
00:44:27,635 --> 00:44:32,134
Should we just die together like this,
or should I just let you go?

558
00:44:32,322 --> 00:44:35,838
Should I resent you,
love you...

559
00:44:36,977 --> 00:44:39,287
Abandon you, stalk you all day?

560
00:44:39,374 --> 00:44:41,500
I thought all sort of
things, like a lunatic fool.

561
00:44:41,593 --> 00:44:44,941
So? What do you plan to do?

562
00:44:45,059 --> 00:44:46,633
If...

563
00:44:47,631 --> 00:44:50,762
If I can't see you, I'll never be happy.

564
00:44:50,985 --> 00:44:52,324
Whenever I see you, I feel unhappy.

565
00:44:52,441 --> 00:44:54,368
Because of our families?

566
00:44:54,779 --> 00:44:56,917
And what does that matter anyway?

567
00:44:57,739 --> 00:44:59,677
I will ask you one last time.

568
00:45:00,344 --> 00:45:02,305
Forget everything else and leave with me.

569
00:45:02,415 --> 00:45:05,394
You really think it can work between us?

570
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,631
You really think I'd be able to ignore...

571
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:15,079
the fact that your father killed
mine for the rest of my days?

572
00:45:15,208 --> 00:45:18,140
I told you I'd abandon my father and my family,

573
00:45:18,253 --> 00:45:19,051
what else do you want from me?

574
00:45:19,122 --> 00:45:21,006
Minwoo!

575
00:45:25,012 --> 00:45:29,194
I'll accept you no matter
what the conditions are.

576
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:32,430
Even if you had another man's...

577
00:45:38,491 --> 00:45:41,944
You're just like your father.

578
00:45:42,884 --> 00:45:44,764
Selfish....

579
00:45:45,627 --> 00:45:47,688
and cruel.

580
00:45:58,936 --> 00:46:00,534
That's right.

581
00:46:03,118 --> 00:46:05,937
I'm my father's son.

582
00:46:08,286 --> 00:46:15,163
I've spent my life destroying
everything I couldn't possess.

583
00:46:16,327 --> 00:46:21,136
So no matter what I do,
don't you ever resent me.

584
00:46:22,428 --> 00:46:24,970
Because the one responsible for this all...

585
00:46:27,683 --> 00:46:29,997
Lee Miju, it's you.

586
00:47:26,737 --> 00:47:29,961
I want to raise that kid well.

587
00:47:30,478 --> 00:47:34,829
But Minwoo now
thinks he's not his son...

588
00:47:34,953 --> 00:47:36,874
We can just send him to the US.

589
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:37,831
The US?!

590
00:47:37,937 --> 00:47:40,070
Ask around L.A.

591
00:47:40,286 --> 00:47:42,870
Find a place with not too many Koreans,

592
00:47:43,095 --> 00:47:47,557
a decent neighborhood, and
hire someone to raise him.

593
00:47:48,003 --> 00:47:52,446
He will get the best
education available.

594
00:47:52,549 --> 00:47:55,906
And then we can bring him
back in twenty years or so.

595
00:47:56,035 --> 00:47:57,641
You know what I mean?

596
00:47:57,749 --> 00:47:59,517
Yes, Congressman.

597
00:48:01,702 --> 00:48:04,328
- But, when...
- Do it now.

598
00:48:04,438 --> 00:48:05,978
All right.

599
00:48:07,687 --> 00:48:10,529
The longer we wait,
the worse things will get.

600
00:48:10,743 --> 00:48:13,501
The moment you find him a place in the US,

601
00:48:13,687 --> 00:48:16,038
we must get our hands on that kid.

602
00:48:19,644 --> 00:48:24,430
As a closed circuit system, we're
dealing with a semipermanent product.

603
00:48:24,571 --> 00:48:25,511
Director.

604
00:48:25,629 --> 00:48:29,693
Once our development is complete,
could we secure any export outlets?

605
00:48:29,822 --> 00:48:31,426
We're going to export it?!

606
00:48:31,549 --> 00:48:33,082
I think we might have a chance.

607
00:48:33,951 --> 00:48:36,077
Ondol-based gas boilers.

608
00:48:36,547 --> 00:48:40,905
I'm sure it can be a competitive
item on a worldwide scale.

609
00:48:41,022 --> 00:48:43,470
If Beaute in France can help us out,

610
00:48:43,593 --> 00:48:45,938
I think exporting to Europe might be possible.

611
00:48:46,045 --> 00:48:47,774
Europe...

612
00:48:52,697 --> 00:48:56,441
Here... To the development of our new boiler!

613
00:48:56,535 --> 00:49:00,048
Cheers! Cheers! Cheers!

614
00:49:08,007 --> 00:49:10,410
How is Manbo Construction's situation?

615
00:49:10,533 --> 00:49:16,973
In terms of technology, their boiler
couldn't possibly compete with ours.

616
00:49:17,084 --> 00:49:19,280
Told you there's nothing to worry about!

617
00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:23,306
When the prototype is ready,
it's game over.

618
00:49:23,446 --> 00:49:27,522
Once the prototype is complete,
we'll start our advertising campaign.

619
00:49:27,628 --> 00:49:29,858
Then, how are we going to proceed?

620
00:49:29,961 --> 00:49:32,978
We'll advertise boilers and
apartments at the same time,

621
00:49:33,094 --> 00:49:34,744
so I thought we could do a TV commercial.

622
00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:36,815
But that's going to be expensive.

623
00:49:36,928 --> 00:49:38,925
Is money the problem?

624
00:49:39,051 --> 00:49:41,715
The New City concessions
depend on this sale.

625
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:45,285
Then, we'll have to find
ourselves a model for those CFs.

626
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:46,944
I'll do it.

627
00:49:47,051 --> 00:49:49,989
President, my lifetime
dream is that of being on TV...

628
00:49:50,107 --> 00:49:52,091
I'm really confident I can do well.

629
00:49:52,216 --> 00:49:53,351
Gyeongja.

630
00:49:53,476 --> 00:49:55,438
Please, don't get started, uh?

631
00:49:55,556 --> 00:49:58,050
What's wrong with me?

632
00:49:59,291 --> 00:50:03,655
If I stand up in Myeongdong,
everyone just starts staring at me.

633
00:50:03,762 --> 00:50:06,582
Ahh... Who got Gyeongja drunk again?

634
00:50:06,687 --> 00:50:08,402
Gyeongja, have a seat.

635
00:50:08,696 --> 00:50:10,813
I've already decided who our model will be.

636
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:14,205
- Already? And who is it?
- Cha Soojeong.

637
00:50:14,381 --> 00:50:17,196
That's nice.

638
00:50:17,312 --> 00:50:20,247
Cha Soojeong is the best!

639
00:50:20,418 --> 00:50:21,962
Cha Soojeong.

640
00:50:23,014 --> 00:50:24,457
That's nice.

641
00:50:24,568 --> 00:50:27,712
Cha Soojeong is the best!

642
00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:30,613
Not to mention that she'll work for free.

643
00:50:30,717 --> 00:50:31,946
For free?!

644
00:50:32,055 --> 00:50:35,128
She might be your sister,
but how can you do that?

645
00:50:35,252 --> 00:50:37,592
Cha Soojeong was Gangmo Oppa's sister?!

646
00:50:37,702 --> 00:50:39,513
You didn't even know that?

647
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:41,181
Just drink.

648
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:47,083
After refusing our CF
offers on several occasions,

649
00:50:47,202 --> 00:50:50,275
looks like Cha Soojeong signed
with Hangang Construction instead.

650
00:50:51,964 --> 00:50:55,679
If Hangang Construction's boilers become a hit,

651
00:50:55,864 --> 00:50:59,816
we will be badly defeated
in the upcoming Suseo sale.

652
00:51:00,157 --> 00:51:01,352
Director Moon.

653
00:51:01,613 --> 00:51:02,412
Yes, Chairman.

654
00:51:02,529 --> 00:51:07,956
If my father was in my place as we speak,

655
00:51:08,649 --> 00:51:10,728
how do you think he
would have reacted to this?

656
00:51:11,555 --> 00:51:16,833
I can't say I'm really familiar
with Congressman Jo's style...

657
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:19,711
He would not hesitate and
go for the jugular right away.

658
00:51:19,817 --> 00:51:20,956
What?

659
00:51:21,977 --> 00:51:24,774
He couldn't care less
about rules or principles.

660
00:51:24,893 --> 00:51:28,939
And of course, since he never
had such a thing as conscience,

661
00:51:29,061 --> 00:51:30,820
he would never feel guilty to begin with.

662
00:51:30,949 --> 00:51:32,171
He would just...

663
00:51:33,992 --> 00:51:35,988
go at his foe's throat.

664
00:51:39,079 --> 00:51:42,392
First, prepare the following.

665
00:51:43,249 --> 00:51:46,573
Schematics of Beaute Boilers' factory,

666
00:51:46,714 --> 00:51:49,710
and ex-convicts with at
least three previous felonies.

667
00:51:50,571 --> 00:51:53,140
Co... Convicts?!

668
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:54,503
Yes.

669
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,523
Forgive all the other crimes...

670
00:51:56,664 --> 00:52:01,562
It must be people sentenced for arson.

671
00:52:01,891 --> 00:52:04,466
Arson?

672
00:52:05,422 --> 00:52:08,709
Then, are you going to
set the boiler factory on...

673
00:52:08,822 --> 00:52:11,353
I told you, didn't I?

674
00:52:13,245 --> 00:52:15,864
That would be my father's way.

675
00:52:18,524 --> 00:52:21,641
Start by making sure he doesn't
complete that boiler he's developing.

676
00:52:21,759 --> 00:52:26,210
I will only be able to go at him
if he loses Oh Byeongtak's confidence.

677
00:52:27,714 --> 00:52:28,994
That's right...

678
00:52:29,993 --> 00:52:34,544
Why don't you just set his factory on fire?

679
00:52:35,353 --> 00:52:37,565
Get ready.

680
00:52:38,376 --> 00:52:40,396
Yes, Chairman.

681
00:52:47,157 --> 00:52:49,742
The only one who's forcing me to do this...

682
00:52:51,363 --> 00:52:53,771
is you, Lee Miju.

683
00:52:55,204 --> 00:52:58,052
You're responsible for all this.

684
00:53:06,527 --> 00:53:13,369
I mean... Aren't you drinking
a little too much tonight?

685
00:53:15,190 --> 00:53:16,372
Why?

686
00:53:16,493 --> 00:53:18,432
Are you afraid I'll get drunk?

687
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:21,439
Like you're not already drunk...

688
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:24,440
Don't you worry.

689
00:53:24,557 --> 00:53:26,906
I can handle this much
without getting drunk.

690
00:53:27,473 --> 00:53:31,546
I know how tough business is these days.

691
00:53:31,710 --> 00:53:35,695
- Why don't you just leave it to Jeongyeon...
- So you want me...

692
00:53:35,822 --> 00:53:38,081
to tell her everything that's been going on?

693
00:53:41,276 --> 00:53:46,257
I'm not going to let her think
I'm in distress, at least not to her.

694
00:53:51,514 --> 00:53:54,075
Ohh... Jeongyeon, it's you.

695
00:53:56,506 --> 00:53:57,633
Come on in.

696
00:53:57,759 --> 00:53:59,783
I had something to report,

697
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:02,843
did you have a few drinks?

698
00:54:03,261 --> 00:54:05,404
No... It's all right.

699
00:54:12,757 --> 00:54:16,730
Here's the permit application we will file
with the Financial Supervisory Service.

700
00:54:16,929 --> 00:54:20,312
Are you already done
with all the preparatives?

701
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:29,844
The total amount we've been
able to raise is a little over 40 billion.

702
00:54:30,137 --> 00:54:31,323
40 billion?!

703
00:54:31,464 --> 00:54:33,543
Capital is important to get that permit,

704
00:54:33,684 --> 00:54:37,807
{\a6}[*non-executive director, part of the board
of directors but outside the executive]

705
00:54:33,684 --> 00:54:37,807
but it also depends on who your NED* will be.

706
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:39,281
I know.

707
00:54:39,408 --> 00:54:41,820
He not only needs to have
experience in the credit sector,

708
00:54:41,891 --> 00:54:44,099
but also command great influence as well.

709
00:54:44,393 --> 00:54:46,145
Who were you thinking of as NED?

710
00:54:46,258 --> 00:54:50,408
The former Vice Minister of Finance
Im Jongtaek will be entrusted the job.

711
00:54:50,513 --> 00:54:52,218
Minister Im?!

712
00:54:52,385 --> 00:54:54,311
Have you already received his consent?

713
00:54:54,452 --> 00:54:55,391
Yes.

714
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:58,762
Everything has been decided already.

715
00:54:59,068 --> 00:55:00,524
Really?

716
00:55:03,625 --> 00:55:06,926
The name will be Happy Bank,

717
00:55:07,050 --> 00:55:13,729
and barring any last minute obstacles,
we should receive our permit by early next year.

718
00:55:17,499 --> 00:55:19,152
Director Yoo.

719
00:55:20,134 --> 00:55:21,537
Yes...

720
00:55:22,858 --> 00:55:26,623
Baekpa suddenly came to mind...

721
00:55:27,874 --> 00:55:30,241
Thank you, Director Yoo.

722
00:55:31,533 --> 00:55:34,785
If you hadn't been backing me,

723
00:55:34,890 --> 00:55:39,542
I would have never been capable
of achieving all this by myself.

724
00:55:42,596 --> 00:55:44,768
Have a drink.

725
00:55:53,989 --> 00:55:55,868
Good job, Jeongyeon.

726
00:56:10,613 --> 00:56:11,952
We're almost there, Dad.

727
00:56:12,046 --> 00:56:14,813
Nah. Let's walk until we get there.

728
00:56:14,925 --> 00:56:18,295
It's right around
the corner. Go back.

729
00:56:19,213 --> 00:56:23,088
My daughter has become a great woman.

730
00:56:23,382 --> 00:56:26,281
You achieved all that on your own.

731
00:56:26,389 --> 00:56:31,645
Dad... Director Yoo reacted that
way out of happiness, right?

732
00:56:31,754 --> 00:56:35,208
Sure...
Of course she did.

733
00:56:35,534 --> 00:56:40,894
She shed tears because of you.

734
00:56:41,611 --> 00:56:44,371
Out of pride and happiness for you.

735
00:56:44,829 --> 00:56:50,385
I actually worked even
harder for that very reason.

736
00:56:51,055 --> 00:56:54,591
I wanted to see my mother smile for me.

737
00:56:56,259 --> 00:56:57,644
Jeongyeon...

738
00:56:57,761 --> 00:56:59,888
This is only the beginning.

739
00:57:00,276 --> 00:57:03,541
I'm confident I can do well.

740
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:04,843
Right.

741
00:57:04,952 --> 00:57:06,771
I have faith in you.

742
00:57:07,141 --> 00:57:09,943
She will do great,
my daughter.

743
00:57:27,486 --> 00:57:28,463
Chairman.

744
00:57:28,572 --> 00:57:29,871
They're the ones I mentioned.

745
00:57:30,118 --> 00:57:31,544
Have a seat.

746
00:57:45,756 --> 00:57:48,352
They're the schematics of Beaute's factory.

747
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:50,878
Where is the most critical point?

748
00:57:57,156 --> 00:57:58,377
That's right.

749
00:57:59,716 --> 00:58:03,675
It's where they keep their fuel gas tank.

750
00:58:06,047 --> 00:58:11,286
Upon completion of your task,
you will board a flight for the US right away.

751
00:58:11,536 --> 00:58:14,376
Be it running a dry cleaner's or a supermarket,

752
00:58:14,626 --> 00:58:17,676
you'll have a much better life there.

753
00:58:27,990 --> 00:58:31,454
- Then, we'll go ahead as instructed.
- Yes.

754
00:58:32,231 --> 00:58:35,890
Then, we wish you a safe return, President!

755
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:38,592
I haven't seen these fellas around before?!

756
00:58:38,754 --> 00:58:42,022
Yes, they were just
hired as new security guards.

757
00:58:48,095 --> 00:58:50,329
- I'll be counting on you, then.
- Yes.

758
00:58:50,493 --> 00:58:52,314
In a few days the prototype will be ready,

759
00:58:52,408 --> 00:58:54,604
so we'll get back to you in no time.

760
00:58:54,686 --> 00:59:00,128
- Don't skip meals.
- Don't you worry, the food here is great!

761
00:59:00,841 --> 00:59:04,457
- I'll get going.
- Take good care of him!

762
00:59:12,468 --> 00:59:13,795
Come on in, Little Oppa.
Hungry, aren't you?

763
00:59:13,948 --> 00:59:15,216
Yeah.

764
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:16,937
When did you get here, Hyung?

765
00:59:17,078 --> 00:59:19,721
Been waiting you for ages...
I'm starving in here.

766
00:59:19,838 --> 00:59:21,060
Wow...

767
00:59:21,177 --> 00:59:22,981
What is this feast about?

768
00:59:23,095 --> 00:59:28,108
Now that I think about it, I never
really cooked a decent meal for you two.

769
00:59:28,414 --> 00:59:31,033
Doesn't something feel a little strange?

770
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:32,278
Be honest.

771
00:59:32,454 --> 00:59:34,393
What is it that you want?

772
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:36,143
Just enjoy the food, will you?

773
00:59:36,225 --> 00:59:38,151
Let me warm up the soup.

774
00:59:42,151 --> 00:59:43,854
Congrats, Gangmo.

775
00:59:44,171 --> 00:59:47,484
I hear the boiler development is going well.

776
00:59:49,211 --> 00:59:50,761
You just wait, Hyung.

777
00:59:51,217 --> 00:59:55,510
I'll be entrusted the entire New City project.

778
01:00:00,376 --> 01:00:04,816
What do I owe all this to?

779
01:00:08,583 --> 01:00:11,839
I see a different fire in your eyes.

780
01:00:11,952 --> 01:00:13,763
Did anything happen?

781
01:00:14,245 --> 01:00:16,030
How did it go with that list?

782
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:19,669
Congressman Oh and I
are compiling it as we speak.

783
01:00:19,783 --> 01:00:21,487
How many companies will be ousted?

784
01:00:21,603 --> 01:00:24,182
Well... About thirty, I'd say?

785
01:00:24,303 --> 01:00:25,679
Why are you asking?

786
01:00:26,007 --> 01:00:28,192
Save me a spot.

787
01:00:30,164 --> 01:00:32,478
For Hangang Construction?

788
01:02:00,625 --> 01:02:02,848
How's the stew, Oppa?
Any good?

789
01:02:02,974 --> 01:02:04,393
It's really good.

790
01:02:04,503 --> 01:02:09,061
I'm always eating out...
I finally get to eat a decent meal.

791
01:02:09,355 --> 01:02:11,986
Miju. Another bowl, please.

792
01:02:12,327 --> 01:02:13,583
All right, Oppa.

793
01:02:13,772 --> 01:02:15,447
Since you're getting
up, turn on the TV.

794
01:02:15,552 --> 01:02:19,617
You always order people around, don't you?

795
01:02:27,712 --> 01:02:29,341
Breaking News.

796
01:02:29,485 --> 01:02:34,111
A fire suddenly erupted at
the Beaute Boilers factory in Yongin.

797
01:02:34,235 --> 01:02:37,273
According to eye-witness reports,
a blast was heard around 8 pm,

798
01:02:37,402 --> 01:02:41,724
with fire spreading from
the gas tanks inside the factory.

799
01:02:42,276 --> 01:02:43,932
Oppa...

800
01:02:44,453 --> 01:02:47,338
Isn't that your factory?

801
01:02:49,512 --> 01:02:51,438
Gangmo.

802
01:02:57,922 --> 01:03:01,442
So that place is on fire as we speak?

803
01:03:01,657 --> 01:03:02,808
Yes.

804
01:03:03,459 --> 01:03:09,008
It's turning to ashes,
every single inch of it.

805
01:03:16,455 --> 01:03:18,809
The police is confronting eye-witness
reports to find the possible causes,

806
01:03:18,891 --> 01:03:21,929
with the possibility of an accidental
fire caused by negligence gaining ground.

807
01:03:23,064 --> 01:03:24,611
No...

808
01:03:26,291 --> 01:03:27,983
