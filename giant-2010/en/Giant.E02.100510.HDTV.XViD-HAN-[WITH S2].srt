00:00:37,657 --> 00:00:40,388
<i>Who is it you're looking for?</i>

6
00:00:41,538 --> 00:00:43,354
None of your business.

7
00:00:43,577 --> 00:00:45,989
Like I care...

8
00:00:49,095 --> 00:00:51,372
Find some place to sleep nearby.

9
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,477
Go out and do it yourself.

10
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:56,958
If we sleep here,
we'll freeze to death.

11
00:00:57,781 --> 00:00:58,991
I'm cold!

12
00:00:59,135 --> 00:01:02,904
Same goes for me.

13
00:01:05,949 --> 00:01:07,817
I'll give you a hundred won.

14
00:01:10,209 --> 00:01:13,619
I can just pay for your room
as well, can't I?!

15
00:01:38,408 --> 00:01:42,668
Did they heat this damned room or what?

16
00:01:43,334 --> 00:01:46,267
It's like sleeping in a fridge.

17
00:02:07,416 --> 00:02:09,300
My Jeongyeon...

18
00:02:09,444 --> 00:02:12,410
You must be all grown up by now.

19
00:02:17,117 --> 00:02:21,614
As long as those rich parents
of yours are making you happy...

20
00:02:58,784 --> 00:03:02,246
So I'm supposed to sleep
in a place like this?

21
00:03:02,442 --> 00:03:05,278
Then, go back to the station's lobby.

22
00:03:06,515 --> 00:03:09,067
Are the covers here clean, at least?

23
00:03:09,198 --> 00:03:11,419
Cleaner than those newspapers, I guess.

24
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,506
What kind of jackpot is this?

25
00:03:32,835 --> 00:03:33,910
Aigoo...

26
00:03:34,015 --> 00:03:36,599
Not too bad at all.

27
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,677
That's my spot.
Move.

28
00:04:11,865 --> 00:04:13,414
I said move!

29
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:16,623
Trying to heat up the floor
with my body alone was so hard.

30
00:04:16,774 --> 00:04:18,078
Leave.

31
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:28,528
Aigoo... Damned weather.
How could it be so cold?

32
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:44,630
Hey... It's cold over there.
Come here.

33
00:04:44,761 --> 00:04:46,525
Come sleep here.

34
00:04:48,606 --> 00:04:50,448
And where would we have
any space for her to fit in?

35
00:04:50,566 --> 00:04:52,696
Unless you move out of the way...

36
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:55,022
I'm fine here.

37
00:05:01,451 --> 00:05:05,160
But there...
It's got to be chilly...

38
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,479
Hyung.

39
00:05:23,674 --> 00:05:25,974
You made it alive, didn't you?

40
00:05:27,725 --> 00:05:29,437
Hyung...

41
00:05:31,685 --> 00:05:34,517
Nothing happened to you, right?

42
00:05:58,421 --> 00:06:00,375
Sir! He's still alive.

43
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:03,331
Get him up and back to the post.

44
00:06:07,688 --> 00:06:11,381
Where have you been all this time?
Never telling people anything...

45
00:06:11,512 --> 00:06:13,384
Aigoo... I'm beat.

46
00:06:14,302 --> 00:06:16,597
I'm so tired.

47
00:06:16,786 --> 00:06:19,262
Can you prepare me a bath?

48
00:06:19,604 --> 00:06:21,291
Honey...

49
00:06:21,669 --> 00:06:23,693
About Jeongyeon.

50
00:06:24,461 --> 00:06:26,313
What about Jeongyeon?

51
00:06:26,423 --> 00:06:28,621
She'd been throwing
temper tantrums all along,

52
00:06:28,725 --> 00:06:32,585
but she finally took
some money and ran away.

53
00:06:32,781 --> 00:06:36,274
And where could she possibly go?

54
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,465
If I had any idea,
would I be sitting here?

55
00:06:42,464 --> 00:06:46,344
You didn't tell her about
her mother in Daejeon, did you?

56
00:06:46,442 --> 00:06:48,066
Are you out of your mind?

57
00:06:48,171 --> 00:06:51,627
Why would I tell her that?

58
00:06:55,255 --> 00:06:59,141
It's almost curfew time,
where are you going?

59
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:01,412
Shouldn't I go out and find her?!

60
00:07:01,517 --> 00:07:05,058
Just call the police,
and let's wait here.

61
00:07:05,207 --> 00:07:07,541
When she runs out of money,
I guess she'll be back.

62
00:07:07,672 --> 00:07:10,605
What are you doing all day in here?

63
00:07:10,769 --> 00:07:13,186
You can't even keep a kid in check?

64
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:20,402
Will good fortune bless me today?

65
00:07:21,767 --> 00:07:24,114
Looks pretty good?!

66
00:07:53,047 --> 00:07:55,451
- Mom!
- Aigoo... My belly...

67
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,147
Mom.

68
00:08:00,234 --> 00:08:04,707
Those guys came
looking for us, last night.

69
00:08:05,243 --> 00:08:08,941
What about your brother,
what happened to him?

70
00:08:09,137 --> 00:08:11,071
Did they catch him?

71
00:08:11,299 --> 00:08:12,935
<i>No...</i>

72
00:08:13,433 --> 00:08:15,773
It was just them.

73
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,922
It couldn't have
been easy to ditch them off...

74
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:23,228
They said they'd
be looking around here.

75
00:08:23,476 --> 00:08:25,542
<i>I don't think we'll be
able to take the train.</i>

76
00:08:25,642 --> 00:08:28,940
Same goes for the bus terminal...

77
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,613
For the time being,

78
00:08:32,718 --> 00:08:35,526
it might be better to just hide here.

79
00:08:35,657 --> 00:08:36,781
<i>And the money?</i>

80
00:08:36,911 --> 00:08:38,937
<i>This place is quite expensive.</i>

81
00:08:39,054 --> 00:08:40,434
<i>Don't worry.</i>

82
00:08:40,538 --> 00:08:43,587
We have enough money for a few days.

83
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,629
What's wrong?

84
00:08:52,773 --> 00:08:55,403
I'm sure I put it here?!

85
00:09:01,649 --> 00:09:02,658
3,000.

86
00:09:02,756 --> 00:09:03,983
1,500.

87
00:09:04,079 --> 00:09:04,890
2,500.

88
00:09:04,995 --> 00:09:07,504
2,000, and that's my last offer.

89
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:09,772
Fine.

90
00:09:10,156 --> 00:09:11,655
Instead, give me a thousand up-front.

91
00:09:11,812 --> 00:09:13,445
We have to pay for tonight.

92
00:09:13,576 --> 00:09:14,804
No way.

93
00:09:14,935 --> 00:09:16,595
You'll get it when we find my mother.

94
00:09:16,712 --> 00:09:18,854
Ehh... That's so nasty...

95
00:09:20,943 --> 00:09:23,450
So you're looking for your mother?

96
00:09:26,561 --> 00:09:27,722
Here's her address.

97
00:09:27,826 --> 00:09:29,995
You can find it, can't you?

98
00:09:33,445 --> 00:09:34,652
Wait a moment.

99
00:09:34,744 --> 00:09:37,078
I'll go have a word with my mother.

100
00:09:49,007 --> 00:09:50,562
My wallet!

101
00:09:55,688 --> 00:09:58,315
What is it...
Did you lose something?

102
00:09:58,446 --> 00:09:59,857
What?

103
00:10:02,118 --> 00:10:04,546
N...No...

104
00:10:04,728 --> 00:10:07,018
What are you doing? Let's go.

105
00:10:07,933 --> 00:10:09,250
Mom.

106
00:10:09,457 --> 00:10:12,138
I said I'd pay for
the room later tonight,

107
00:10:12,242 --> 00:10:13,545
so you don't need to worry.

108
00:10:13,641 --> 00:10:17,679
Careful not to let them
notice you, understood?

109
00:10:17,835 --> 00:10:19,148
Yes.

110
00:10:22,807 --> 00:10:24,328
Let's go.

111
00:10:33,865 --> 00:10:39,328
Those bastards will pay
for what they did to us.

112
00:10:39,485 --> 00:10:41,566
You just wait.

113
00:10:57,584 --> 00:11:00,942
Congressman Oh is still at the Blue House,
so I'm not sure when he'll be back.

114
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,954
It's all right.
I'll just wait.

115
00:11:03,085 --> 00:11:05,032
If you'll excuse me,
may I ask who you are?

116
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:08,411
I already called the Congressman,
so you don't need to worry.

117
00:11:08,568 --> 00:11:09,899
Yes.

118
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:22,146
Blue House?!

119
00:11:23,035 --> 00:11:24,521
What are you talking about?

120
00:11:24,615 --> 00:11:27,444
Our development projects
in South Seoul have hit a snag?

121
00:11:27,588 --> 00:11:30,816
I'm referring to the Gangnam land we
bought under namesake accounts.

122
00:11:30,999 --> 00:11:33,259
That account list was exposed.

123
00:11:34,049 --> 00:11:38,439
And who got their hands on it?

124
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:43,457
It has to be either the American embassy,
or the EUSA*'s Intelligence Brigade.

125
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:43,470
<i>{\a6}*Eighth United States Army</i>

126
00:11:43,668 --> 00:11:46,460
<i>{\a6}~ Oh Byeongtak ~
(Republican Party - Chief of Finance)</i>

127
00:11:44,224 --> 00:11:45,338
The Americans?!

128
00:11:45,703 --> 00:11:46,728
Why would they?

129
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,841
Isn't that obvious?

130
00:11:47,262 --> 00:11:50,734
<i>{\a6}~ Han Myeongseok (Seoul City Commissioner) ~
~ Park Changwoo (KCIA Director) ~</i>

131
00:11:48,962 --> 00:11:50,674
So that they can interfere
with the next elections,

132
00:11:50,783 --> 00:11:54,268
and prohibit the president
from running for another term.

133
00:11:56,674 --> 00:12:01,284
Even the president is not aware
that we bought that land in Gangnam.

134
00:12:01,395 --> 00:12:04,642
If this leaks out,
nobody here will be safe.

135
00:12:04,749 --> 00:12:08,261
So what I was saying is,
why did you let it get to this point?

136
00:12:08,367 --> 00:12:11,303
Why, did we do this for
the sake of personal benefit?

137
00:12:11,888 --> 00:12:13,670
It was to secure political funding,

138
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:17,030
and show our loyalty to the president
by helping him run for office again.

139
00:12:17,179 --> 00:12:19,764
Anyhow, solving this
is your responsibility.

140
00:12:19,877 --> 00:12:21,642
<i>Listen, Director Park!</i>

141
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:25,448
The leak of classified intel is the KCIA's
responsibility, why should I deal with that?

142
00:12:25,526 --> 00:12:28,541
Aren't you in charge of our
development projects in South Seoul?

143
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:30,373
Ohh Ohh... Listen to you!

144
00:12:30,518 --> 00:12:33,328
This is no time to
be fighting each other.

145
00:12:33,532 --> 00:12:35,763
Whatever it takes,
shouldn't we make sure...

146
00:12:35,871 --> 00:12:38,727
those namesake account details
aren't exposed to the public?

147
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:40,888
Aigoo... My head...

148
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,765
As if we were dealing with the press...

149
00:12:44,869 --> 00:12:47,967
How are you going to stop those
Yankees from revealing everything?

150
00:12:48,084 --> 00:12:50,643
Our hands are not completely tied.

151
00:12:52,359 --> 00:12:53,981
Have any idea?

152
00:12:54,164 --> 00:12:57,996
If a negotiation table is what you want,
you need a card to play against them.

153
00:12:58,241 --> 00:13:02,808
We can get our hands on one of
their classified files, for instance.

154
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:09,133
So, to buy their silence,
you exchange classified files?

155
00:13:09,256 --> 00:13:12,845
The idea alone is certainly enticing,

156
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:16,600
but what classified intel
are we going to steal, and how?

157
00:13:17,619 --> 00:13:21,397
I have an American friend who's
working as war reporter in Vietnam.

158
00:13:21,498 --> 00:13:22,195
And?

159
00:13:22,261 --> 00:13:25,192
He said there's a rumor that a top
secret document regarding the Vietnam war...

160
00:13:25,248 --> 00:13:26,603
is being prepared as we speak.

161
00:13:26,694 --> 00:13:28,317
A top secret document?!

162
00:13:28,425 --> 00:13:30,909
And that document's latest revision...

163
00:13:31,022 --> 00:13:33,626
happens to be kept in a safe
at the EUSA headquarters in Korea.

164
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:35,984
And what is it about?

165
00:13:36,135 --> 00:13:38,266
We don't know the details,

166
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:41,229
but what is evident is that,
should this document leak to the public,

167
00:13:41,427 --> 00:13:46,413
the American government would fall
into a severe crisis as a result.

168
00:13:47,335 --> 00:13:52,554
A top secret document at the EUSA's HQ?!

169
00:13:58,742 --> 00:14:01,356
<i>~ Eighth United States Army ~
Headquarters</i>

170
00:14:08,069 --> 00:14:09,891
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

171
00:14:21,769 --> 00:14:25,898
These people found you
unconscious, and brought you here.

172
00:14:29,742 --> 00:14:32,487
Where am I?

173
00:14:32,623 --> 00:14:34,995
It's the Eighth Army's headquarters.

174
00:14:36,367 --> 00:14:40,449
Then, is this Seoul?

175
00:14:42,383 --> 00:14:43,450
Sir.

176
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:46,770
He doesn't have any
serious external injuries,

177
00:14:47,034 --> 00:14:49,192
except for some bruises.

178
00:14:49,505 --> 00:14:51,031
What's your name?

179
00:14:51,948 --> 00:14:54,975
Your name.
Don't you know your name?

180
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:00,892
I don't.

181
00:15:01,056 --> 00:15:02,481
You don't?!

182
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:07,981
I can't remember a thing.

183
00:15:14,234 --> 00:15:15,472
Sir.

184
00:15:15,694 --> 00:15:18,500
I think he suffered a head trauma,

185
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:21,463
<i>which might have affected his memory.</i>

186
00:15:21,574 --> 00:15:23,590
You mean he's got amnesia?

187
00:15:23,852 --> 00:15:25,198
Possibly.

188
00:15:25,406 --> 00:15:28,208
Well...
I want you to keep an eye on him.

189
00:15:28,331 --> 00:15:30,045
Until he recovers his memory.

190
00:15:30,124 --> 00:15:31,534
Yes, Sir.

191
00:15:41,128 --> 00:15:43,003
You're really lucky.

192
00:15:43,354 --> 00:15:46,830
You met the most kind-hearted
American officer in the entire base.

193
00:16:07,942 --> 00:16:10,096
Gangmo...

194
00:16:10,856 --> 00:16:12,737
Miju...

195
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:16,053
Mother...

196
00:16:23,271 --> 00:16:25,034
Ahh... Don't bother.

197
00:16:25,444 --> 00:16:29,044
So you came all the way
to Seoul just to meet me?

198
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:32,991
<i>{\a6}*deferential form of seonbae,
older colleague/fellow college alumni</i>

199
00:16:29,453 --> 00:16:32,991
I had a favor to ask you, Seonbaenim*.

200
00:16:33,377 --> 00:16:35,879
I have enough trouble
on my plate as it is,

201
00:16:35,989 --> 00:16:38,503
so what's with you and favors now?

202
00:16:38,848 --> 00:16:43,711
As you well know, the Defense Ministry
just announced personnel changes.

203
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:48,628
You've come all the way here,
so let's have a drink.

204
00:16:56,412 --> 00:16:57,664
Help me out.

205
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:03,818
With your influence, you could
certainly take me under your wings.

206
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:06,013
Drinks are on me, this time.

207
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,277
What's this?

208
00:17:14,749 --> 00:17:16,374
Go ahead and open it.

209
00:17:27,576 --> 00:17:32,099
So you want me to take this money,
and engage in trafficking of official posts?

210
00:17:32,382 --> 00:17:34,232
Is that not enough?

211
00:17:34,854 --> 00:17:36,873
What do you take me for...

212
00:17:37,061 --> 00:17:38,250
Take it and leave!

213
00:17:38,363 --> 00:17:40,986
I'm not here just for the money!

214
00:17:41,089 --> 00:17:42,929
That money is not for you.

215
00:17:43,061 --> 00:17:44,901
Just funds I'm devoting to our country.

216
00:17:45,514 --> 00:17:48,890
If you wish to maintain power,
you need immense funds.

217
00:17:49,016 --> 00:17:53,323
Aren't you using the Gangnam development
project to gain political funds...

218
00:17:53,496 --> 00:17:55,239
Ehh Ehh! Listen to you!

219
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:58,333
Careful what you say.

220
00:17:58,503 --> 00:18:02,296
I'll devote this money to the president.

221
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:07,923
Give me a chance to devote myself
for the sake of this country.

222
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:16,456
As you said, we need money.

223
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:21,265
However, we can't just accept any money
without knowing where it comes from.

224
00:18:21,371 --> 00:18:23,136
As God is my witness,

225
00:18:23,305 --> 00:18:26,193
I swear this money is completely clean.

226
00:18:30,552 --> 00:18:32,618
What do you want in return?

227
00:18:34,278 --> 00:18:37,703
I want to join the KCIA.

228
00:18:37,967 --> 00:18:41,932
I don't believe in those who only profess
their loyalty by flapping their tongue.

229
00:18:42,866 --> 00:18:47,574
What can I do to gain your trust?

230
00:18:51,423 --> 00:18:53,095
Let's get up.

231
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:55,539
We need to go somewhere together.

232
00:19:03,828 --> 00:19:06,158
How about it, Director Park?

233
00:19:06,293 --> 00:19:12,015
I think he's the perfect
candidate for the job?

234
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:16,621
For starters, you'll be
assigned to the Eighth Army.

235
00:19:16,809 --> 00:19:21,396
There is something you must
do there for the country.

236
00:19:22,102 --> 00:19:23,421
After you succeed,

237
00:19:23,535 --> 00:19:27,789
you will be accepted into the KCIA.

238
00:19:31,138 --> 00:19:33,583
Tell me what task you have in mind.

239
00:19:34,112 --> 00:19:38,197
There's a certain General Hampton
at the EUSA Intelligence Brigade.

240
00:19:38,999 --> 00:19:42,847
He will be in possession of a top secret
document regarding the Vietnam war.

241
00:19:46,574 --> 00:19:49,030
Bring us that document.

242
00:19:55,014 --> 00:19:57,137
I just met them.

243
00:19:58,288 --> 00:19:59,571
Yes.

244
00:20:00,292 --> 00:20:03,316
The kid who witnessed us
fell off the train and died,

245
00:20:03,421 --> 00:20:06,078
and they're looking for
his family as we speak.

246
00:20:06,794 --> 00:20:08,089
Should I tell them to withdraw?

247
00:20:08,202 --> 00:20:09,985
<i>Since there's no witness anymore...</i>

248
00:20:10,089 --> 00:20:12,976
Why would you let free the
possible cause of our downfall?

249
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,447
Trail them all the way.

250
00:20:14,532 --> 00:20:16,054
<i>Understood.</i>

251
00:20:28,878 --> 00:20:32,642
When will we get to the end
of this neighborhood?

252
00:20:35,871 --> 00:20:37,200
Be honest.

253
00:20:37,304 --> 00:20:39,304
You don't know this place
too well, do you?

254
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:42,548
I never said I live here.

255
00:20:43,482 --> 00:20:45,738
You even fool people?

256
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,779
Let me ask you something.

257
00:20:52,892 --> 00:20:54,676
Where is No. 18 here?

258
00:20:54,808 --> 00:20:57,572
18 is the last house up there?!

259
00:20:57,678 --> 00:20:59,352
<i>Are you looking for someone?</i>

260
00:20:59,457 --> 00:21:00,362
My mother.

261
00:21:00,471 --> 00:21:01,898
Your mother?!

262
00:21:02,467 --> 00:21:05,155
So that woman living next
to the porch is your mother?

263
00:21:05,261 --> 00:21:07,597
Yes, I was told she lives there.

264
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:09,239
Will be no use going there.

265
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:10,806
She already took a hike a few days ago.

266
00:21:10,901 --> 00:21:13,388
A hike?!
Why would she run away?

267
00:21:13,498 --> 00:21:17,571
Why do you think?
She must have had her reasons.

268
00:21:21,112 --> 00:21:23,027
Thank you.

269
00:21:24,443 --> 00:21:25,575
Just in case.

270
00:21:25,735 --> 00:21:29,631
If the landlord asks you,
don't tell her it's your mother.

271
00:21:29,742 --> 00:21:31,780
You'll only get in trouble.

272
00:21:32,186 --> 00:21:33,271
Yes.

273
00:21:42,171 --> 00:21:43,964
Anyone in?

274
00:22:01,239 --> 00:22:06,607
You don't seem like
someone she owed money to.

275
00:22:06,748 --> 00:22:09,154
By any chance,
are you her daughter?

276
00:22:09,267 --> 00:22:10,324
What?

277
00:22:10,947 --> 00:22:15,410
I recall her saying she had a
daughter in Seoul or something?

278
00:22:16,693 --> 00:22:18,844
No...

279
00:22:19,032 --> 00:22:23,132
My mother just told us to check
if she was living here.

280
00:22:23,245 --> 00:22:27,140
Aigoo... So she fooled someone
else out of their money.

281
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:29,943
That brat was just scum.

282
00:22:30,056 --> 00:22:32,941
<i>She had a new man
coming in every night,</i>

283
00:22:33,035 --> 00:22:37,526
and after making a mess, she knocked
at every door begging for money,

284
00:22:37,639 --> 00:22:40,073
and eventually took off
like nothing happened.

285
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:45,923
I should have guessed it right
when she said she was working at a bar...

286
00:22:46,036 --> 00:22:47,480
Aigoo...

287
00:22:55,002 --> 00:22:58,012
<i>~ 9 - My Daughter's Birthday ~</i>

288
00:23:34,296 --> 00:23:36,052
Mom...

289
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:39,825
Where have you gone, Mom?

290
00:23:40,784 --> 00:23:42,731
Mom...

291
00:24:02,497 --> 00:24:05,764
Lodging is a given...

292
00:24:06,732 --> 00:24:07,807
By the way, Eonni.

293
00:24:07,882 --> 00:24:09,986
Is business doing well there?

294
00:24:11,807 --> 00:24:13,472
All right... I get it.

295
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:16,372
Instead, any tip is mine.

296
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:19,223
Ohh... I'll come tomorrow.

297
00:24:21,438 --> 00:24:24,608
What's with putting on airs,
for that little rat hole of a bar?

298
00:24:32,546 --> 00:24:35,370
- Are you sure of that?
- Yes.

299
00:24:35,761 --> 00:24:39,912
Having to carry a newborn around,
she won't have gone far.

300
00:24:40,438 --> 00:24:42,685
We're keeping an eye on both
the bus terminal and the station,

301
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:44,730
so we'll spot her soon.

302
00:24:47,487 --> 00:24:48,821
By any chance,

303
00:24:48,949 --> 00:24:51,274
are you looking for
a woman with three kids?

304
00:24:52,141 --> 00:24:56,019
A newborn, a little girl and a boy.

305
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:00,539
Where have you seen them?

306
00:25:02,093 --> 00:25:05,190
And she said people were after her...

307
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:06,162
It's true?!

308
00:25:06,247 --> 00:25:07,728
We're in a rush,

309
00:25:07,832 --> 00:25:10,039
so just tell us where you've seen them.

310
00:25:12,226 --> 00:25:15,660
Ajeosshi, I'm headed for Seoul,

311
00:25:15,811 --> 00:25:18,622
but I'm a little short of money.

312
00:25:20,673 --> 00:25:24,727
Ehh... Just two?!

313
00:25:24,868 --> 00:25:29,840
When I get to Seoul, I don't know
the way, so I'll need a taxi?!

314
00:25:41,853 --> 00:25:44,017
Know the inn down
the turnabout alley?

315
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:47,414
We spent the night together there.

316
00:26:04,533 --> 00:26:07,552
Even the wallet looks expensive.

317
00:26:11,232 --> 00:26:13,219
And how much is this?

318
00:26:47,892 --> 00:26:49,993
Jeongyeon...

319
00:27:03,056 --> 00:27:04,743
Who are you people?

320
00:27:06,227 --> 00:27:09,158
Where's that woman
with the three kids?

321
00:27:09,262 --> 00:27:11,601
Three kids or whatever,
get out of here!

322
00:27:11,705 --> 00:27:13,696
You even walk in with your shoes on?!

323
00:27:13,809 --> 00:27:15,910
<i>Get the hell out!</i>

324
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:23,016
<i>I told you I know nothing.</i>

325
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:26,063
<i>Either pay and check in, or leave!</i>

326
00:27:26,167 --> 00:27:28,002
<i>You don't know?
Are we supposed to believe that?</i>

327
00:27:28,077 --> 00:27:30,785
<i>- She's here, isn't she?
- There's nobody!</i>

328
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:34,211
- You really are pushing it!
- Look at this Ajumma...

329
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,568
<i>Ajumma?!</i>

330
00:27:35,681 --> 00:27:38,982
<i>I'm the owner here!
Uh?! I own this inn.</i>

331
00:27:39,067 --> 00:27:40,001
<i>Leave!</i>

332
00:27:40,104 --> 00:27:41,463
<i>Out... Get out.</i>

333
00:27:41,556 --> 00:27:43,670
Leave... Out of here.

334
00:27:43,831 --> 00:27:46,397
I said stop interfering
with my business and leave!

335
00:28:25,907 --> 00:28:28,766
Hurry and come out.

336
00:28:29,483 --> 00:28:32,738
I saw her pass by the coffeehouse.

337
00:28:41,284 --> 00:28:42,761
Please, don't cry...

338
00:28:42,849 --> 00:28:44,869
Don't cry.

339
00:28:54,624 --> 00:28:56,247
<i>You can rest assured now.</i>

340
00:28:56,552 --> 00:28:59,888
They're gone,
so it will be safe here.

341
00:29:04,178 --> 00:29:05,748
By the way.

342
00:29:05,862 --> 00:29:09,414
Do you know where that girl
who was here with us has gone?

343
00:29:10,254 --> 00:29:13,722
She... left with my son,

344
00:29:14,796 --> 00:29:17,574
and they went looking
for someone together.

345
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:38,029
Hey... Aren't you hungry?

346
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:43,775
I saw a place down there
selling dough buns.

347
00:29:44,369 --> 00:29:46,479
Should I go get some?

348
00:29:50,677 --> 00:29:53,859
Then, let's just go!
My mother is waiting.

349
00:29:53,966 --> 00:29:55,813
Go by yourself.

350
00:29:57,596 --> 00:30:00,037
Then, give me my money.
2,000 won.

351
00:30:01,426 --> 00:30:02,917
You couldn't find my mother.

352
00:30:02,992 --> 00:30:06,138
Give me at least half,
I don't have any money to go back.

353
00:30:07,911 --> 00:30:09,272
Are you listening to me?

354
00:30:09,411 --> 00:30:11,082
Give me my money.

355
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,157
I don't have it.

356
00:30:15,006 --> 00:30:16,196
What?

357
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:17,932
You don't have what?

358
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:20,291
I have no money.

359
00:30:20,659 --> 00:30:22,451
They stole my wallet.

360
00:30:22,643 --> 00:30:24,621
Then, my money?

361
00:30:28,506 --> 00:30:29,818
Hey!

362
00:30:31,459 --> 00:30:33,488
Dad...

363
00:31:06,074 --> 00:31:11,272
Seeing it firsthand, it's all much
bigger than I could ever imagine.

364
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:13,801
So all construction costs
have been settled?

365
00:31:14,235 --> 00:31:15,357
Yes.

366
00:31:15,621 --> 00:31:20,195
Thanks to you,
we overcame this crisis.

367
00:31:20,686 --> 00:31:23,073
Once this construction is complete,

368
00:31:23,277 --> 00:31:27,318
I'll pay you back for
all the help you've given me.

369
00:31:28,195 --> 00:31:32,528
That's your share,
so no need to pay me back.

370
00:31:32,614 --> 00:31:33,853
No.

371
00:31:34,429 --> 00:31:36,526
I will pay it back.

372
00:31:40,602 --> 00:31:42,310
Listen, Director Hwang.

373
00:31:43,282 --> 00:31:47,244
Did you already forget what
you pledged right in my face?

374
00:31:48,161 --> 00:31:53,075
When you said you'd be loyal to me,
whatever it took.

375
00:31:53,666 --> 00:31:57,103
So if I tell you not to do something,
just listen to me.

376
00:31:57,255 --> 00:31:58,537
Is that clear?

377
00:32:04,933 --> 00:32:07,959
From now on, we'll get to see
each other quite often.

378
00:32:08,251 --> 00:32:11,662
I've been appointed to the Eighth Army,
as part of the Korean support unit.

379
00:32:13,083 --> 00:32:15,527
Then, is it a promotion?

380
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,904
I'm a major now, so I guess it is?!

381
00:32:18,729 --> 00:32:23,532
Find a decent place for
my family near the base.

382
00:32:24,003 --> 00:32:25,164
Yes.

383
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,060
I will.

384
00:32:29,806 --> 00:32:31,190
Ohh... You're back?

385
00:32:31,301 --> 00:32:33,577
So, what did the police tell you?

386
00:32:33,906 --> 00:32:35,922
That there's still no news.

387
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:41,822
I think I'll just have to go myself.

388
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:44,127
I apologize.

389
00:32:44,236 --> 00:32:47,173
I have some urgent matters
to tend to in Daejeon.

390
00:32:47,317 --> 00:32:48,468
Daejeon?

391
00:32:48,601 --> 00:32:54,646
Actually, it's because
my daughter ran away...

392
00:32:55,236 --> 00:32:58,099
My aide is in Daejeon as we speak.

393
00:32:58,212 --> 00:33:01,693
I'll give him a call,
so if you need any help, feel free.

394
00:33:02,033 --> 00:33:05,362
- It's all right.
- It's not all right with me.

395
00:33:05,532 --> 00:33:09,834
If it involves your family,
it involves me as well.

396
00:33:10,796 --> 00:33:14,059
Are we not family now?

397
00:33:34,918 --> 00:33:37,053
<i>Let's get moving, you brat.</i>

398
00:33:45,629 --> 00:33:47,838
My mother is waiting.

399
00:33:48,083 --> 00:33:49,910
So just go!

400
00:33:50,816 --> 00:33:54,400
My legs hurt so much
I can't walk any longer.

401
00:33:55,073 --> 00:33:58,276
First the cold,
then you're hungry... Whatever!

402
00:34:07,988 --> 00:34:09,392
It's always your fault!

403
00:34:09,502 --> 00:34:12,529
You should have told me
about your wallet!

404
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:18,521
I thought we would meet my mother.

405
00:34:28,554 --> 00:34:30,150
Get on my back.

406
00:34:31,747 --> 00:34:34,113
You said you have no money
and know nobody here.

407
00:34:34,235 --> 00:34:36,226
So get on my back, you brat.

408
00:34:37,273 --> 00:34:38,510
You don't need to bother.

409
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:39,473
Just go.

410
00:34:39,548 --> 00:34:41,709
My legs hurt and I'm hungry as well.

411
00:34:41,803 --> 00:34:43,448
Come on.

412
00:34:45,845 --> 00:34:48,492
You... If you don't get on my back
to the count of three,

413
00:34:48,577 --> 00:34:50,527
I'm just leaving.

414
00:34:51,036 --> 00:34:52,413
<i>1...</i>

415

2...

416
00:35:02,077 --> 00:35:05,744
I knew it when you
started putting on airs...

417
00:35:05,868 --> 00:35:08,548
What's with all the trouble
you're forcing on me?

418
00:35:09,031 --> 00:35:12,682
Still, since I'm on your back,
you're not as cold.

419
00:35:12,757 --> 00:35:13,757
What?

420
00:35:14,031 --> 00:35:17,314
- Does that make any sense?
- I'm hungry, so stop prattling.

421
00:35:17,389 --> 00:35:18,549
You brat...

422
00:35:18,634 --> 00:35:20,796
How can a girl be so heavy?

423
00:35:24,262 --> 00:35:25,494
Stay put.

424
00:35:25,607 --> 00:35:27,088
Stop moving, will you?

425
00:35:27,173 --> 00:35:31,239
- Let me down. Now!
- I said stop moving!

426
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,276
Pay for the room?!

427
00:35:52,386 --> 00:35:53,616
It's paid for already.

428
00:35:53,716 --> 00:35:54,840
What?

429
00:35:55,227 --> 00:35:56,727
My mother shouldn't have any money?

430
00:35:56,831 --> 00:35:59,843
Not your mother,
some other woman paid for her.

431
00:35:59,953 --> 00:36:00,605
Who?

432
00:36:00,689 --> 00:36:03,678
The hell I know, did she prance around
with her ID stamped on her face?

433
00:36:03,776 --> 00:36:05,255
Go in.

434
00:36:09,372 --> 00:36:12,633
She'll take over my spot tonight.

435
00:36:12,768 --> 00:36:13,767
Go in.

436
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,380
Then, you?

437
00:36:18,408 --> 00:36:21,314
We can take shifts sleeping, can't we?
One hour each.

438
00:36:21,408 --> 00:36:23,867
That woman paid for you as well.

439
00:36:23,978 --> 00:36:25,069
Me as well?!

440
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,362
Yeah.

Yeah...

445
00:36:36,376 --> 00:36:39,157
Since it's late, seems like
the pain came back to haunt me.

446
00:36:39,265 --> 00:36:42,014
How about medicine?
Have anything left?

447
00:36:42,294 --> 00:36:46,319
Forget that, and go find Miju.

448
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:48,819
I haven't seen her in a while.

"Ha! Will he be feeling
the same for me?"

Oppa, you're hurting me! Let go!

What are you, some street beggar?
Uh?

You... Try to beg like that again,
and I'll make you pay. Got it?

476
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:47,477
Mommy is hurting, what else can I do?

477
00:38:49,277 --> 00:38:51,830
She ran out of medicine,

478
00:38:52,056 --> 00:38:55,651
and she couldn't
eat a thing all day long!

<i>She can't even

I hate it myself, it's embarrassing.

482

But what if even Mommy ends up dying?

483
00:39:09,476 --> 00:39:12,191
<i>Will you take responsibility?</i>

00:39:16,059 --> 00:39:18,946
<i>Mommy...</i>

486
00:39:22,108 --> 00:39:28,083
I don't want Mommy to die!
Mommy...

487
00:39:34,694 --> 00:39:36,703
From now on...

488
00:39:37,804 --> 00:39:40,222
I'll do the begging,
if we ever need to.

489
00:39:41,967 --> 00:39:47,351
Dad and Hyung are not with us,

490
00:39:48,323 --> 00:39:50,342
so I'll take care of everything.

491
00:39:51,408 --> 00:39:55,514
So don't do that again.

492
00:39:55,656 --> 00:39:58,250
Oppa...

493
00:40:08,745 --> 00:40:09,839
It's cold.

494
00:40:09,934 --> 00:40:11,453
Let's go back in.

495
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:15,179
Let's use this and buy some dumplings.

496
00:40:15,299 --> 00:40:18,113
Mommy loves them.

497
00:40:18,528 --> 00:40:19,840
All right.

498
00:40:19,953 --> 00:40:21,747
<i>Let's go.</i>

499
00:40:34,551 --> 00:40:36,757
Ohh... That...

500
00:40:38,837 --> 00:40:40,261
That's the...

501
00:40:43,005 --> 00:40:44,189
Miju...

502
00:40:44,299 --> 00:40:46,187
- Quick!
- Catch them!

503
00:41:13,052 --> 00:41:14,629
Spread out.

504
00:43:28,549 --> 00:43:30,353
Thank y...

505
00:43:42,535 --> 00:43:44,469
Thank you.

506
00:43:59,255 --> 00:44:03,207
She sure has grown into a pretty girl?!

507
00:44:17,116 --> 00:44:18,292
<i>Hey!</i>

508
00:44:18,502 --> 00:44:20,063
<i>Hey!</i>

509
00:44:25,459 --> 00:44:27,695
It's clear, come out.

510
00:44:35,861 --> 00:44:38,553
Eonni, what's that?

511
00:44:41,468 --> 00:44:42,987
Dumplings.

512
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,026
You said you had no money.

513
00:44:45,115 --> 00:44:47,175
I took the coins you dropped
when you ran away.

514
00:44:47,298 --> 00:44:48,892
Really?

515
00:44:49,581 --> 00:44:50,411
Let's go.

516
00:44:50,515 --> 00:44:52,496
Mom must be hungry.

517
00:44:55,666 --> 00:44:57,381
Mommy!

518
00:44:59,277 --> 00:45:01,418
Mommy's not here?!

519
00:45:12,705 --> 00:45:15,566
<i>This one is just gold-plated...</i>

520
00:45:16,497 --> 00:45:21,404
This is not too bad, but you
won't get much money out of it?!

521
00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:23,738
Not even five thousand won?

522
00:45:23,848 --> 00:45:24,893
Five thousand?!

523
00:45:24,987 --> 00:45:27,900
Ehh... What are you saying?
Take all this back.

524
00:45:28,325 --> 00:45:31,914
Then, whatever you can give me.

525
00:45:35,752 --> 00:45:38,315
Show me that ring.

526
00:45:44,209 --> 00:45:46,100
This one?

527
00:45:56,642 --> 00:46:03,272
If you leave this with me, what the hell...
I'll be generous and give you 3,000 won.

528
00:46:07,342 --> 00:46:09,065
<i>Just endure it a little longer.</i>

529
00:46:09,272 --> 00:46:11,292
Once prices of land in
Apgujeong-Dong start moving,

530
00:46:11,424 --> 00:46:13,943
we'll be able to get our own room.

531
00:46:14,056 --> 00:46:17,990
We'll eat all the pork ribs we want,

532
00:46:18,141 --> 00:46:20,188
send the kids to college,

533
00:46:20,305 --> 00:46:22,839
and live a nice life.

534
00:46:31,526 --> 00:46:34,149
If you don't want to, just go.

535
00:46:39,371 --> 00:46:41,644
Give me that money.

536
00:46:47,365 --> 00:46:52,770
Is there any way I
could get to Seoul from here?

537
00:46:57,207 --> 00:47:01,028
Should we leave a few for your
mother, and eat some first?

538
00:47:01,251 --> 00:47:05,602
No way... I'll eat them with Mommy.

539
00:47:11,201 --> 00:47:14,634
Then, should we eat just one?

540
00:47:14,756 --> 00:47:17,820
Right. Just one each.

541
00:47:27,226 --> 00:47:28,441
Go ahead and eat.

542
00:47:28,548 --> 00:47:30,495
They're still warm.

543
00:47:32,788 --> 00:47:34,022
It's all right.

544
00:47:34,108 --> 00:47:35,759
Go ahead.

545
00:47:41,173 --> 00:47:42,427
Aren't you going to?

546
00:47:42,531 --> 00:47:46,663
Yeah... I'll wait for Mommy.

547
00:47:51,324 --> 00:47:53,226
Must feel great.

548
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:54,880
What?

549
00:47:55,691 --> 00:47:57,528
Having your mother by your side.

550
00:47:57,650 --> 00:48:00,766
Why, don't you have a mother?

551
00:48:13,445 --> 00:48:14,914
Gangmo.

552
00:48:15,117 --> 00:48:16,834
Mom.

553
00:48:17,344 --> 00:48:19,341
Where have you been?
I was worried.

554
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:20,980
And Miju?

555
00:48:21,214 --> 00:48:23,112
She's inside.

556
00:48:29,725 --> 00:48:32,462
You keep this money.

557
00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:35,789
Where did you find it?

558
00:48:39,194 --> 00:48:41,857
We'll go to Seoul tomorrow.

559
00:48:41,965 --> 00:48:43,502
Go how?

560
00:48:44,165 --> 00:48:45,518
A truck.

561
00:48:45,613 --> 00:48:48,795
It will pass right here tomorrow,
so sleep early.

562
00:48:48,919 --> 00:48:50,248
Your medicines?

563
00:48:50,618 --> 00:48:52,801
Did you take them?

564
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:55,772
Wait a moment.

565
00:48:55,886 --> 00:48:58,395
I'll go buy them.

566
00:49:07,095 --> 00:49:08,753
Mom...

567
00:49:11,543 --> 00:49:14,460
I'll never get ill again.

568
00:49:16,053 --> 00:49:18,437
If we can get to Seoul...

569
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:25,762
I promise I'll never make you go
through all this trouble again.

570
00:49:41,913 --> 00:49:43,272
<i>Her name is Hwang Jeongyeon.</i>

571
00:49:43,404 --> 00:49:45,082
<i>Here she is.</i>

572
00:49:46,299 --> 00:49:47,800
All right.

573
00:49:48,148 --> 00:49:50,045
We'll start searching for her
in the morning.

574
00:49:50,148 --> 00:49:52,988
We don't know where
she might be sleeping tonight.

575
00:49:53,111 --> 00:49:55,563
You'll pardon me,
but I'd rather you started now.

576
00:49:55,667 --> 00:49:57,445
It's almost curfew time.

577
00:49:57,540 --> 00:49:59,445
And I don't even have enough men.

578
00:49:59,577 --> 00:50:03,691
Then, even if my daughter
freezes to death on the street,

579
00:50:03,794 --> 00:50:05,521
you couldn't care less?

580
00:50:05,719 --> 00:50:07,589
What damned police station is this?

581
00:50:07,712 --> 00:50:09,117
Director Hwang...

582
00:50:09,342 --> 00:50:10,391
What's with the attitude?

583
00:50:10,513 --> 00:50:11,843
Attitude?!

584
00:50:11,985 --> 00:50:15,108
I'm rotting inside because
I can't find my daughter,

585
00:50:15,212 --> 00:50:17,516
is staring at trouble from the
other side all that police can do?

586
00:50:17,629 --> 00:50:19,553
Get these people out of my face!

587
00:50:19,956 --> 00:50:21,214
<i>Wait.</i>

588
00:50:22,965 --> 00:50:24,591
And who are you?

589
00:50:34,374 --> 00:50:36,657
You come from the Security Command?

590
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:38,935
Troublesome as it might be,

591
00:50:39,061 --> 00:50:41,198
start searching for that girl right now.

592
00:50:41,306 --> 00:50:43,652
Yes...
We will start right away.

593
00:50:43,810 --> 00:50:45,775
Get the patrol car ready.

594
00:50:45,907 --> 00:50:47,869
<i>Yes, Chief.</i>

595
00:50:52,789 --> 00:50:55,554
Aww... It's so damn noisy
I can't close an eye!

596
00:50:55,676 --> 00:50:58,500
Take the kid out, at least!
Do something!

597
00:50:58,607 --> 00:51:01,375
Did you rent the entire
damned room or something?

598
00:51:01,488 --> 00:51:03,469
I'm sorry...

599
00:51:03,658 --> 00:51:07,366
Baby... What's wrong?

600
00:51:12,394 --> 00:51:13,120
Mom.

601
00:51:13,215 --> 00:51:14,309
I'll take the baby.

602
00:51:14,394 --> 00:51:16,545
No, it'll be the same
in the other room as well.

603
00:51:16,639 --> 00:51:17,498
Just go to sleep.

604
00:51:17,592 --> 00:51:20,073
I'll put her to sleep,
so you go ahead and sleep.

605
00:51:20,177 --> 00:51:22,821
I said it's all right...

606
00:51:22,934 --> 00:51:26,000
Mommy, I need to pee...

607
00:51:27,552 --> 00:51:28,774
Go by yourself.

608
00:51:28,877 --> 00:51:29,981
No way!

609
00:51:30,088 --> 00:51:33,104
That toilet is too scary.

610
00:51:33,925 --> 00:51:37,664
Mom, I'll take Miju to the toilet,
and then she'll sleep with me.

611
00:51:37,843 --> 00:51:39,353
Hurry up.

612
00:52:22,943 --> 00:52:24,581
Come on in...

613
00:52:25,539 --> 00:52:26,547
Here again?

614
00:52:26,654 --> 00:52:28,682
That room is too cold.

615
00:52:28,996 --> 00:52:32,189
Don't spare the briquettes tonight.

616
00:52:32,404 --> 00:52:34,921
As if I didn't have enough
trouble with all the empty rooms...

617
00:52:35,031 --> 00:52:36,340
You know how much
those briquettes cost?

618
00:52:36,453 --> 00:52:38,708
I can just pay for them.

619
00:52:44,270 --> 00:52:45,459
This much?!

620
00:52:45,534 --> 00:52:48,307
If you don't heat up
those rooms for real,

621
00:52:48,421 --> 00:52:50,495
I'll set the damned place on fire.

622
00:52:50,627 --> 00:52:52,239
You've been warned.

623
00:52:52,602 --> 00:52:53,802
That... That...

624
00:52:53,922 --> 00:52:56,469
Listen to how she talks.

625
00:52:57,810 --> 00:53:00,862
How many briquettes
can I buy with this?!

626
00:53:22,444 --> 00:53:24,501
<i>Mom...</i>

627
00:53:31,350 --> 00:53:33,575
Don't go...

628
00:53:33,688 --> 00:53:36,500
Mom, don't go...

629
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:17,081
<i>I'll only sleep
next to you for tonight,</i>

630
00:54:17,229 --> 00:54:20,138
<i>and I won't bother you again.</i>

631
00:54:22,728 --> 00:54:28,899
<i>Jeongyeon... You must never
become a despicable person like me.</i>

632
00:54:29,201 --> 00:54:35,654
<i>So... Don't look for me again,</i>

633
00:54:35,824 --> 00:54:38,352
<i>don't say you miss me,</i>

634
00:54:38,871 --> 00:54:42,586
<i>and just pretend
as if I didn't even exist.</i>

635
00:54:45,426 --> 00:54:49,105
<i>I haven't done a single thing for you.</i>

636
00:54:54,211 --> 00:54:56,815
<i>I'm sorry, Jeongyeon...</i>

637
00:54:58,354 --> 00:55:01,008
<i>Don't forgive me.</i>

638
00:55:04,322 --> 00:55:06,470
<i>Jeongyeon...</i>

639
00:55:08,989 --> 00:55:13,534
<i>My pretty daughter...</i>

640
00:55:20,384 --> 00:55:22,372
Should I get the pipe fixed?

641
00:55:22,486 --> 00:55:25,646
What's wrong with the furnace?

642
00:55:47,661 --> 00:55:49,396
<i>Gangmo.</i>

643
00:55:50,178 --> 00:55:51,576
<i>Lee Gangmo.</i>

644
00:55:51,746 --> 00:55:53,443
<i>Get up.</i>

645
00:55:55,580 --> 00:55:59,052
You need to go to school,
you know what time it is?

646
00:56:00,278 --> 00:56:03,325
Are you going somewhere?

647
00:56:04,682 --> 00:56:06,431
To meet your dad.

648
00:56:06,617 --> 00:56:07,869
Dad?!

649
00:56:08,117 --> 00:56:10,931
Daddy asked me out on a date?!

650
00:56:11,125 --> 00:56:12,724
A date?!

651
00:56:13,186 --> 00:56:19,887
We'll go out on a date,
watch a movie, and have a nice lunch.

652
00:56:20,173 --> 00:56:23,264
So you're leaving us behind
and going all by yourselves?

653
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:27,623
How much longer are you
going to pretend you're a kid?

654
00:56:27,744 --> 00:56:32,152
You have to feed Miju
and keep the house clean.

655
00:56:32,284 --> 00:56:34,152
When will you be back?

656
00:56:34,952 --> 00:56:36,724
Gangmo.

657
00:56:37,494 --> 00:56:42,271
I trust you more
than anyone in the world.

658
00:56:43,327 --> 00:56:48,570
My Gangmo will become a great man.

659
00:56:50,377 --> 00:56:55,626
I'll always be looking at you,
so don't let this bring you down.

660
00:56:55,882 --> 00:56:58,118
You must be strong.

661
00:56:58,861 --> 00:57:03,297
Can you promise me that?

662
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:05,646
Mom...

663
00:57:07,244 --> 00:57:09,978
Take good care of your siblings,

664
00:57:10,878 --> 00:57:15,366
and whatever happens,
you must never cry.

665
00:57:15,647 --> 00:57:17,657
Understood?

666
00:57:19,830 --> 00:57:21,498
Mom.

667
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:23,555
I...

668
00:57:24,914 --> 00:57:27,517
I'll trust you on that and go.

669
00:57:45,569 --> 00:57:47,266
Mom...

670
00:58:42,986 --> 00:58:45,467
Jeongyeon...

671
00:58:52,401 --> 00:58:54,164
Jeongyeon... Get up...

672
00:58:54,268 --> 00:58:55,957
Wake up!

673
00:59:29,909 --> 00:59:31,730
Mom!

674
01:00:54,429 --> 01:00:56,837
It's Mommy!
Mommy!

675
01:01:17,394 --> 01:01:19,173
<i>Is this her?</i>

676
01:01:23,684 --> 01:01:26,083
She's not the one we were looking for.

677
01:01:26,272 --> 01:01:28,094
That's a relief.

678
01:02:19,810 --> 01:02:23,763
Oppa... Let go!

679
01:02:29,664 --> 01:02:33,288
Let go! Let me go!
Let me go back to Mommy!

680
01:02:33,386 --> 01:02:36,353
Let me see Mommy!

681
01:02:40,978 --> 01:02:42,805
Listen well.

682
01:02:43,475 --> 01:02:45,032
Mom...

683
01:02:53,704 --> 01:02:56,681
Mom is gone.
She's dead.

684
01:02:56,868 --> 01:03:01,200
So... Stop looking for her.

685
01:03:01,465 --> 01:03:02,823
Liar.

686
01:03:02,964 --> 01:03:05,200
It's for real, you silly!

687
01:03:07,252 --> 01:03:09,252
She's no longer of this world,
is that clear?

688
01:03:09,366 --> 01:03:11,988
No way!
Mommy didn't die!

689
01:03:12,117 --> 01:03:14,592
You're just a liar!

690
01:03:15,035 --> 01:03:16,158
Miju.

691
01:03:16,344 --> 01:03:18,174
Lee Miju!

692
01:03:30,732 --> 01:03:32,534
<i>God.</i>

693
01:03:33,072 --> 01:03:36,440
I'll give you my favorite dolls.

694
01:03:36,789 --> 01:03:41,733
So bring me back my Mommy.

695
01:03:43,044 --> 01:03:45,790
I'll listen to everything she tells me,

696
01:03:46,281 --> 01:03:49,119
and Oppa as well.

697
01:03:49,667 --> 01:03:51,864
And I'll brush my teeth before sleep.

698
01:03:52,043 --> 01:03:56,361
Every weekend, I'll come to church.

699
01:03:56,826 --> 01:03:58,685
<i>God...</i>

700
01:03:58,949 --> 01:04:02,214
Bring my mother back to me.

701
01:04:02,308 --> 01:04:04,392
Uh, God?

702
01:04:09,514 --> 01:04:11,494
Why do you keep acting like a fool?

703
01:04:11,605 --> 01:04:13,317
<i>I told you she's dead.</i>

704
01:04:13,427 --> 01:04:16,315
If she's dead, how can she
come back to you?! You silly fool.

705
01:04:16,422 --> 01:04:18,514
You're even more of a fool!

706
01:04:18,617 --> 01:04:23,804
If she's dead, we must pray
for God to bring her back to us!

707
01:04:28,683 --> 01:04:29,950
What?

708
01:04:30,149 --> 01:04:32,147
Mommy always told me.

709
01:04:32,260 --> 01:04:35,913
That God will always
listen to our prayers!

710
01:04:37,037 --> 01:04:38,366
God...

711
01:04:38,470 --> 01:04:41,612
Please, bring our mother back to us.

712
01:04:41,725 --> 01:04:44,140
<i>Uh, God?</i>

713
01:04:45,406 --> 01:04:48,008
<i>Mommy...</i>

714
01:04:49,545 --> 01:04:51,775
<i>Mommy...</i>

715
01:04:55,813 --> 01:04:58,604
<i>Mommy...</i>

716
01:05:01,030 --> 01:05:03,625
Why did you take her?

717
01:05:04,363 --> 01:05:06,559
Save her.

718
01:05:07,933 --> 01:05:12,644
Why did you even take away our mother?

719
01:05:14,826 --> 01:05:17,220
- Bring her back.
- Oppa...

720
01:05:21,317 --> 01:05:26,235
Bring our poor mother back to us!

721
01:05:28,230 --> 01:05:32,002
Send her back to us!

722
01:05:36,155 --> 01:05:39,026
<i>Why did you take her...</i>

723
01:05:40,388 --> 01:05:42,592
Mom...

724
01:05:44,394 --> 01:05:46,160
Mom...

725
01:05:46,670 --> 01:05:48,707
Mom...

726
01:05:49,368 --> 01:05:51,858
I miss you.

727
01:05:53,141 --> 01:05:57,313
- Mommy...
- Mom...

728
01:06:00,294 --> 01:06:05,313
Mom...

729
01:06:27,093 --> 01:06:29,616
Jeongyeon.

730
01:06:29,713 --> 01:06:32,142
Are you feeling better?

731
01:06:36,545 --> 01:06:37,860
Dad...

732
01:06:37,949 --> 01:06:40,469
Right, it's your Daddy.

733
01:06:40,576 --> 01:06:44,297
Now I'm here, so don't
you worry about a thing.

734
01:06:45,643 --> 01:06:50,398
Go get an ambulance ready
to transfer her to Seoul.

735
01:06:50,549 --> 01:06:52,120
All right.

736
01:06:55,205 --> 01:06:57,398
In my dreams...

737
01:06:58,712 --> 01:07:02,485
Someone suddenly woke me up.

738
01:07:03,258 --> 01:07:05,890
She was calling my name,

739
01:07:06,140 --> 01:07:08,041
saying "wake up!"

740
01:07:08,409 --> 01:07:10,114
You little...

741
01:07:10,237 --> 01:07:14,341
So why did you run away
from home like that?

742
01:07:18,812 --> 01:07:22,651
Did you meet your mother?

743
01:07:25,639 --> 01:07:30,959
Do you really want
to meet her that much?

744
01:07:35,778 --> 01:07:40,538
When you get better,
I'll bring you to her.

745
01:07:41,350 --> 01:07:42,359
Really?

746
01:07:42,517 --> 01:07:43,642
Sure.

747
01:07:43,739 --> 01:07:46,378
So you need to hurry up
and get better, you silly.

748
01:07:50,576 --> 01:07:54,642
<i>- How about this patient's guardian?
- Still nobody.</i>

749
01:08:08,636 --> 01:08:10,071
<i>Do you know her?</i>

750
01:08:10,184 --> 01:08:11,184
Uh?!

751
01:08:15,374 --> 01:08:16,651
Is she dead?

752
01:08:17,011 --> 01:08:21,635
I think it'll be hard
for her to survive the night.

753
01:08:52,461 --> 01:08:55,523
You wretched brat...

754
01:08:56,505 --> 01:08:59,571
If luck has completely
turned its back on you,

755
01:08:59,957 --> 01:09:03,278
at least live a long life.

756
01:09:05,401 --> 01:09:07,522
Of all places you could choose,

757
01:09:08,105 --> 01:09:14,323
you want to die right in front of
your daughter, who's dying to meet you?

758
01:09:15,210 --> 01:09:19,040
Ehh... You foolish, vicious brat.

759
01:09:26,695 --> 01:09:29,192
If you were going to die anyway,

760
01:09:29,412 --> 01:09:32,966
at least do it in
your daughter's embrace.

761
01:09:37,521 --> 01:09:41,066
How are you going to rest in peace,

762
01:09:42,774 --> 01:09:46,803
without ever hearing her
call you "mother"?

763
01:09:48,442 --> 01:09:51,935
Ehh... You crooked brat.

764
01:10:01,234 --> 01:10:04,285
Doctor, come over here a moment.

765
01:10:07,949 --> 01:10:09,865
<i>Check her pulse right away,
and stabilize her temperature.</i>

766
01:10:09,950 --> 01:10:11,119
<i>All right.</i>

767
01:10:11,242 --> 01:10:12,751
Jeongyeon...

768
01:10:12,885 --> 01:10:14,789
Jeongyeon...

769
01:10:17,584 --> 01:10:19,499
Jeongyeon...

770
01:10:36,128 --> 01:10:37,331
<i>Close this one.</i>

771
01:10:37,463 --> 01:10:38,444
Yes.

772
01:10:52,764 --> 01:10:54,946
Where are the Korean Army
support quarters?

773
01:10:55,053 --> 01:10:59,128
Yes... Go straight until
the very last building.

<i>What's the closest oil storage
to the B-side barracks?</i>

781
01:11:29,419 --> 01:11:31,947
<i>Make the oil storage explode.</i>

782
01:11:32,148 --> 01:11:33,778
Who's out there?

<i>We have no place to go now.</i>

784

<i>We lost our bags, you silly.</i>

<i>Everything we had was in there.</i>

786
01:11:40,607 --> 01:11:42,540
<i>Why don't you follow us
to the orphanage?</i>

787
01:11:42,644 --> 01:11:45,365
Oppa, I don't want to leave the baby.

788
01:11:45,441 --> 01:11:46,724
<i>Let's stay together.</i>

789
01:11:46,799 --> 01:11:48,548
I don't need any of you!

790
01:11:48,653 --> 01:11:50,901
Just leave us alone!

791
01:11:51,024 --> 01:11:55,689
You must find them, even if you have
to ransack every orphanage in town.

792
01:11:55,793 --> 01:11:57,189
What happened to you?

793
01:11:57,293 --> 01:12:00,236
<i>I'll have to do it myself, then.</i>

794
01:12:00,340 --> 01:12:01,878
<i>They call it 3-1 Building.</i>

795
01:12:01,963 --> 01:12:05,002
<i>It's the tallest in Seoul,
with 31 stories.</i>

796
01:12:05,127 --> 01:12:07,758
Big Oppa...
Hurry up and come...

<i>I miss you, Big Oppa!</i>

Did he see your face?

01:12:13,082 --> 01:12:16,683
Did he see your face or not?

800
01:12:16,796 --> 01:12:20,212
If he regains his consciousness,
it's all over for us.
