Episode 51

4
00:00:17,884 --> 00:00:19,851
Wooju, are you back?

5
00:00:20,299 --> 00:00:22,420
Wooju, see you tomorrow.

6
00:00:23,397 --> 00:00:24,511
Chairman.

7
00:00:24,604 --> 00:00:27,412
It's that kid.

8
00:00:53,433 --> 00:00:59,077
Establish a support fund for the
kindergarten that kid is frequenting.

9
00:00:59,205 --> 00:01:02,286
You want to help his kindergarten?

10
00:01:02,443 --> 00:01:04,468
I'll have to take a closer look at that boy.

11
00:01:04,582 --> 00:01:07,275
I understand what you mean, Chairman.

12
00:01:25,758 --> 00:01:27,042
Yes.

13
00:01:27,855 --> 00:01:28,811
Ahh... Yes.

14
00:01:28,939 --> 00:01:30,209
What can I do for you, Reporter Kim?

15
00:01:30,337 --> 00:01:32,662
Cha Soojeong's real name is Lee Miju.

16
00:01:32,805 --> 00:01:36,485
That kid named Wooju is her son for sure.

17
00:01:38,963 --> 00:01:40,133
Let's talk face to face.

18
00:01:40,218 --> 00:01:42,030
I'll call you again.

19
00:01:43,742 --> 00:01:45,600
This is serious, Chairman.

20
00:01:45,709 --> 00:01:50,545
Reporter Kim from Celeb Daily has
learned that Lee Miju is that kid's mother.

21
00:01:51,418 --> 00:01:53,327
How shall we proceed?

22
00:01:55,552 --> 00:01:57,514
Tell him to come to our offices.

23
00:01:57,743 --> 00:01:59,055
I will meet him firsthand.

24
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:04,004
But Chairman, if he begins suspecting
any possible connection between you two...

25
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:06,600
If Miju's kid turns out to be...

26
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:14,054
I must settle this on my own.

27
00:02:14,197 --> 00:02:15,232
Do as instructed.

28
00:02:15,318 --> 00:02:17,206
All right, Chairman.

29
00:02:22,249 --> 00:02:25,245
You still haven't dealt with that reporter?

30
00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:27,121
I did try to get in touch a few times,

31
00:02:27,264 --> 00:02:28,918
but he refuses to meet, so...

32
00:02:29,018 --> 00:02:30,858
And you even try to make excuses now?

33
00:02:30,944 --> 00:02:34,181
I apologize.... Director.

34
00:02:34,524 --> 00:02:38,313
Keep calling him until he agrees
to meet tonight at the Royal Club.

35
00:02:38,422 --> 00:02:40,857
Yes. I will.

36
00:02:54,498 --> 00:02:57,133
I see you've got yourself quite a scoop.

37
00:02:58,171 --> 00:03:00,342
How do you plan to proceed?

38
00:03:00,842 --> 00:03:04,579
I'll keep digging into it a
little deeper, and then publish it.

39
00:03:05,748 --> 00:03:07,403
Director Moon.

40
00:03:08,001 --> 00:03:14,114
How much money did we invest in
the apartments Miss Cha is advertising?

41
00:03:14,888 --> 00:03:18,225
If we add the New City apartments
which are under development,

42
00:03:18,354 --> 00:03:21,149
I'd say over ten billion won in total.

43
00:03:21,392 --> 00:03:23,860
You know that Celeb
Daily's president Jo Cheolyeon...

44
00:03:24,031 --> 00:03:26,142
is a distant relative of my father, right?

45
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:28,453
Ahh... Is that so?

46
00:03:28,858 --> 00:03:31,917
So go ahead and write that
article about Cha Soojeong.

47
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,398
Instead, any damages
we might incur in the process...

48
00:03:35,526 --> 00:03:37,109
will have to be dealt
with by President Jo himself.

49
00:03:37,238 --> 00:03:38,707
What?

50
00:03:39,606 --> 00:03:42,102
Then, why don't you
just change your model...

51
00:03:42,168 --> 00:03:46,020
Are you suggesting we change our
marketing strategy based on groundless rumors?

52
00:03:46,149 --> 00:03:47,661
That is not what I meant...

53
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,601
I leave the judgment to you.

54
00:03:51,612 --> 00:03:53,580
It's time for our meeting.

55
00:04:00,555 --> 00:04:03,742
What's wrong with Chairman Jo?

56
00:04:03,849 --> 00:04:06,093
Why obsess over someone with such
a troubled background like Cha Soojeong...

57
00:04:06,164 --> 00:04:09,259
I'm just telling you
this for your own sake,

58
00:04:15,469 --> 00:04:19,011
but I suggest you leave it at that.

59
00:04:26,014 --> 00:04:28,525
I've heard from Manager Park.

60
00:04:30,134 --> 00:04:34,490
So there appear to be strange
rumors spreading about Soojeong?

61
00:04:37,409 --> 00:04:39,075
The reason I invited you here....

62
00:04:39,182 --> 00:04:41,442
You don't need to worry.

63
00:04:41,693 --> 00:04:44,024
Since I no longer plan to write that article.

64
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,346
You've made the right decision.

65
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:51,895
- Because if you wrote about such groundless rumors...
- Miss Cha?

66
00:04:52,794 --> 00:04:55,031
You've found yourself
quite the remarkable sponsor.

67
00:04:55,126 --> 00:04:57,870
What are you trying to say?

68
00:04:57,982 --> 00:05:00,083
Thank you for the drinks.

69
00:05:07,605 --> 00:05:09,599
What's that supposed to mean?

70
00:05:09,758 --> 00:05:11,853
Sponsor?!

71
00:05:12,466 --> 00:05:14,485
I have no idea.

72
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:28,041
He's officially registered as son
of a certain Kang Jeongja,

73
00:05:28,167 --> 00:05:31,006
but she is way too old to have children.

74
00:05:31,634 --> 00:05:35,157
- Kang Wooju -

75
00:05:52,298 --> 00:05:54,236
Seongmo.

76
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:56,446
What brings you here, Congressman?

77
00:05:57,317 --> 00:05:59,699
I had an appointment with Director Kim.

78
00:06:00,179 --> 00:06:02,081
Everything is fine, I hope?

79
00:06:02,223 --> 00:06:04,363
I might have lost a
little attachment for the force,

80
00:06:04,491 --> 00:06:06,189
but I'm trying to patch up the wounds.

81
00:06:06,901 --> 00:06:11,460
If you have the time,
go pay Minwoo a visit.

82
00:06:12,445 --> 00:06:15,745
I can't get in touch with him,

83
00:06:15,855 --> 00:06:17,437
and I get the feeling
he's trying to avoid me.

84
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,990
Isn't he past that age already?

85
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:22,287
It's because of that Lee Miju.

86
00:06:22,387 --> 00:06:25,990
We should have cut
her off for good back then...

87
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:33,236
I know how busy you are, but
keep Minwoo in check for me.

88
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,852
What will he meet the director for?

89
00:06:42,967 --> 00:06:45,371
The director went
to Busan in the morning.

90
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:46,262
What?

91
00:06:46,361 --> 00:06:48,957
I'm sure he came to meet Chief Oh.

92
00:06:50,298 --> 00:06:52,637
I have a bad feeling about this.

93
00:06:53,623 --> 00:06:55,790
Don't let your guard down.

94
00:06:56,817 --> 00:06:58,530
Yes, Chief.

95
00:07:03,522 --> 00:07:04,838
Allow me to introduce myself.

96
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:07,553
I'm new recruit Ji Yeonsoo.

97
00:07:09,867 --> 00:07:14,199
I've been assigned under your
command for the next five months.

98
00:07:14,326 --> 00:07:17,504
Ohh... So it was you.

99
00:07:17,822 --> 00:07:18,916
Starting with this round,

100
00:07:18,988 --> 00:07:21,413
every agent ranked section chief and
above will be assigned recruits for training.

101
00:07:21,498 --> 00:07:23,387
So you take care of her, Chanseong.

102
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,976
I'm well aware of your reputation, Chief.

103
00:07:26,074 --> 00:07:27,475
I hope I can count on your help, Sir!

104
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:29,345
Start by fixing
the way you address me.

105
00:07:29,402 --> 00:07:30,301
Are we in the army?

106
00:07:30,401 --> 00:07:33,453
Yes! S...ir...

107
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:35,336
One more thing.

108
00:07:36,848 --> 00:07:38,560
Don't talk too much.

109
00:07:38,827 --> 00:07:40,652
I can't stand that.

110
00:07:41,325 --> 00:07:43,780
Yes, Chief...

111
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:19,995
As you've seen,

112
00:08:20,105 --> 00:08:23,321
we couldn't really find anything suspicious.

113
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,359
The way I see it,
all this feels unnatural.

114
00:08:27,472 --> 00:08:31,353
That entire event is suspicious in itself.

115
00:08:31,462 --> 00:08:33,983
Explain yourself.

116
00:08:35,067 --> 00:08:39,846
The host of that event
was this Hwang Jeongyeon.

117
00:08:40,017 --> 00:08:45,280
She's the daughter of Hwang
Taeseop, who's eying an entrance into politics.

118
00:08:47,378 --> 00:08:51,765
They never planned
to invite politicians there.

119
00:08:51,908 --> 00:08:57,143
But for some unknown reason,
the situation suddenly changed.

120
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,197
And something else which doesn't compute...

121
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,237
is those opposition party members.

122
00:09:01,436 --> 00:09:08,876
These are the same people who called the
Olympics an excuse to prolong the regime's lifespan,

123
00:09:09,028 --> 00:09:12,599
and now they just participate
in an event in support of it?!

124
00:09:12,699 --> 00:09:16,279
Of course, Hwang
Jeongyeon convinced them.

125
00:09:17,622 --> 00:09:22,224
All those opposition party members
were actually supposed to be in Busan,

126
00:09:22,323 --> 00:09:24,494
for a major demonstration which
would take place the day after.

127
00:09:24,594 --> 00:09:28,958
So all that those CCTV
cameras caught on tape...

128
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:33,940
Was a show someone
orchestrated from behind the scenes.

129
00:09:34,064 --> 00:09:36,857
And you were the
ones who fell into their trap.

130
00:09:37,156 --> 00:09:41,664
And you're suggesting that
Hwang Jeongyeon is behind all this.

131
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:47,327
Can't say... It's still too
early to jump to conclusions.

132
00:09:47,426 --> 00:09:50,008
Then, who? Hwang Taeseop?

133
00:10:03,525 --> 00:10:05,311
Here's Lee Gangmo.

134
00:10:05,454 --> 00:10:07,622
He's the president
of Hangang Construction.

135
00:10:08,098 --> 00:10:12,006
He is extremely tenacious
and quick on his feet.

136
00:10:13,085 --> 00:10:15,858
Not to mention daring.

137
00:10:15,972 --> 00:10:20,059
And what would a businessman
gain from getting involved in all this?

138
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:23,059
He bears a grudge against me.

139
00:10:23,171 --> 00:10:27,099
Of course that alone can't prove anything,

140
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:31,758
but if anyone is capable of
orchestrating all this from behind the scenes,

141
00:10:32,383 --> 00:10:35,481
he's without a doubt our best bet.

142
00:10:37,284 --> 00:10:39,347
So dig into him.

143
00:10:39,489 --> 00:10:41,504
Since you're there, add Hwang Jeongyeon.

144
00:10:41,646 --> 00:10:45,726
You'll be surprised to see the results.

145
00:10:45,968 --> 00:10:47,296
I'll give that a try.

146
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:51,988
And I'm sure you'll also handle
Lee Seongmo as discussed?

147
00:10:52,116 --> 00:10:53,642
Don't worry about that.

148
00:10:53,756 --> 00:10:56,646
I've already proceeded in that direction.

149
00:11:01,674 --> 00:11:04,106
How is Miju?

150
00:11:04,327 --> 00:11:05,175
Why?

151
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:09,283
You know, last time at the
Royal Club with Jo Minwoo...

152
00:11:11,865 --> 00:11:16,096
It really felt like they loved each other.

153
00:11:16,195 --> 00:11:20,774
Miju knows that our father
died because of Jo Pilyeon.

154
00:11:26,022 --> 00:11:29,193
- It's getting late.
- Gangmo.

155
00:11:33,757 --> 00:11:36,194
- Sorry for being late.
- No worries.

156
00:11:36,289 --> 00:11:40,535
Jeongyeon, let me introduce the daughter of
Chairman Cheon of Gwangmyeong Construction.

157
00:11:40,624 --> 00:11:42,018
I'm Cheon Suyeon.

158
00:11:42,122 --> 00:11:44,039
I'm Hwang Jeongyeon.

159
00:11:44,434 --> 00:11:46,678
I've heard a lot about
you from President Lee.

160
00:11:46,778 --> 00:11:48,760
So you're good friends?

161
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,256
Yes.

162
00:11:51,699 --> 00:11:55,179
You must be busy, so should
I get straight to the point?

163
00:11:55,413 --> 00:11:58,831
I'd like to invest two hundred million.

164
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:01,172
Here's the contract.

165
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,480
Give it a read.

166
00:12:04,588 --> 00:12:09,400
I'll just trust Gangmo and
invest without any questions.

167
00:12:09,514 --> 00:12:13,010
If anything goes wrong,
you'll have to take responsibility.

168
00:12:13,693 --> 00:12:15,277
Fine with me.

169
00:12:16,972 --> 00:12:20,470
I guarantee you this
investment won't disappoint you.

170
00:12:20,613 --> 00:12:22,182
Really?

171
00:12:24,065 --> 00:12:28,814
But... I guess you just
came from the boiler factory?

172
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:30,581
What?

173
00:12:31,294 --> 00:12:33,124
There...

174
00:12:39,487 --> 00:12:41,511
Use this to wipe it.

175
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,240
It's all right, later.

176
00:12:48,143 --> 00:12:49,399
Let me do it.

177
00:12:49,499 --> 00:12:53,032
How can a president go
around with that on his shirt?

178
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:11,832
Miju knows that our father
died because of Jo Pilyeon.

179
00:13:27,099 --> 00:13:30,650
My father is really interested in
this boiler development, too.

180
00:13:30,749 --> 00:13:32,204
If you're successful with your project,

181
00:13:32,304 --> 00:13:34,458
he plans to use those boilers in his apartments.

182
00:13:35,228 --> 00:13:37,685
I'll have to give him a call, then?

183
00:13:45,321 --> 00:13:46,957
Excuse me.

184
00:13:47,228 --> 00:13:50,880
Please tell President Lee Gangmo that I
had to leave because of another appointment.

185
00:13:50,994 --> 00:13:53,083
Yes, I will.

186
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:04,637
Water has started boiling here,

187
00:14:04,766 --> 00:14:06,278
is it still all right on your side?

188
00:14:06,349 --> 00:14:08,594
Don't you worry about me,

189
00:14:08,651 --> 00:14:10,691
and focus on your side.

190
00:14:10,748 --> 00:14:12,131
Yes.

191
00:14:15,086 --> 00:14:15,940
Director Yang!

192
00:14:16,025 --> 00:14:17,666
Director Yang, are you all right?

193
00:14:17,794 --> 00:14:19,432
Is anyone out there?

194
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:20,561
Come help us!

195
00:14:20,632 --> 00:14:22,387
Director Yang... Director Yang!

196
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:24,182
Anyone?

197
00:14:33,474 --> 00:14:35,250
Come on in.

198
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:39,016
How did it happen?

199
00:14:39,244 --> 00:14:41,177
It was an accident.

200
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,543
Suddenly the valve's lid just...

201
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,269
What did the doctors say?

202
00:14:46,576 --> 00:14:50,589
Thankfully it's not life-threatening,

203
00:14:50,663 --> 00:14:51,903
but what now?

204
00:14:52,031 --> 00:14:55,797
Now we'll suffer delays in our development.

205
00:14:55,925 --> 00:14:59,637
The important thing now is
for Director Yang to fully recover.

206
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:04,715
Then we can forget about
completing development on time?

207
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:10,349
For the time being, you take
over the construction site, Shideok.

208
00:15:10,569 --> 00:15:11,918
Gangmo, and you?

209
00:15:12,054 --> 00:15:15,705
Him and I will focus on the boiler.

210
00:15:15,876 --> 00:15:17,702
It's no use.

211
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:22,594
Even a technician like him can't
solve it, how are we supposed to do it?

212
00:15:22,694 --> 00:15:24,563
We'll just have to keep trying.

213
00:15:25,233 --> 00:15:26,702
We can't just keep lying idle.

214
00:15:26,774 --> 00:15:31,376
Ahh... Told you we should have had a ceremony
when we first acquired the company.

215
00:15:37,615 --> 00:15:43,172
It's not only innovative for our
domestic market, but worldwide.

216
00:15:44,442 --> 00:15:46,576
It was completed a lot
earlier than I imagined.

217
00:15:46,732 --> 00:15:50,655
A lot of the merit
should go to Mister Kim here.

218
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:53,009
I have high expectations for the future.

219
00:15:54,334 --> 00:15:58,971
Right... We learned that there
was an accident at the Beaute factory.

220
00:16:00,383 --> 00:16:01,169
Really?

221
00:16:01,276 --> 00:16:02,886
Their technical director was seriously injured,

222
00:16:02,986 --> 00:16:05,939
so they'll suffer substantial delays as a result.

223
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:11,759
It seems that it'll be virtually impossible
for them to develop their boiler on time.

224
00:16:12,001 --> 00:16:15,168
We will begin a huge advertising campaign
in concomitance with the apartment sale.

225
00:16:15,296 --> 00:16:17,592
Pay special attention to avoid any leaks.

226
00:16:17,721 --> 00:16:19,447
All right, Chairman.

227
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:23,498
Chairman, I think we should go.

228
00:16:45,642 --> 00:16:48,272
Here's our section manager.

229
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:49,842
I already heard the details.

230
00:16:49,941 --> 00:16:53,051
So you'll fix our playground free of charge?

231
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:56,797
Our chairman has a vested
interest in marketing for children.

232
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:59,085
Thank you, Manager.

233
00:16:59,277 --> 00:17:00,810
Can I take a look around?

234
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:02,616
Certainly.

235
00:17:25,342 --> 00:17:26,717
What?

236
00:17:26,841 --> 00:17:28,978
Help me up, please.

237
00:17:29,076 --> 00:17:30,042
What?

238
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:33,187
I need to wash my hands.

239
00:17:47,998 --> 00:17:50,102
What's the matter, Chairman?

240
00:17:58,782 --> 00:18:00,051
- Kang Wooju -

241
00:18:02,619 --> 00:18:06,798
You remember me?

242
00:18:09,292 --> 00:18:15,202
I helped you get your
airplane back at the hospital.

243
00:18:15,626 --> 00:18:17,751
And helped you wash your hands.

244
00:18:22,425 --> 00:18:24,246
Tell me...

245
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:27,883
Where is your father?

246
00:18:28,867 --> 00:18:33,132
Is your father home?

247
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,486
In heaven.

248
00:18:36,903 --> 00:18:38,308
Heaven?!

249
00:18:38,448 --> 00:18:43,008
My Daddy is in heaven.

250
00:18:58,229 --> 00:19:01,881
Ever tried that?

251
00:19:10,496 --> 00:19:12,151
Want me to do that for you?

252
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:13,739
No.

253
00:19:14,046 --> 00:19:14,851
No?

254
00:19:14,965 --> 00:19:20,970
Only my Daddy can do that.

255
00:19:36,127 --> 00:19:38,508
- Chairman.
- Wow...

256
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:45,515
Wow... Wooju is the tallest now.

257
00:19:51,003 --> 00:19:54,469
Ahh... Let's go finish what
we were discussing inside.

258
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:57,151
- Here... Let's go.
- Yes...

259
00:20:05,627 --> 00:20:07,196
Want to ride a plane?

260
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:09,090
Let's do that.

261
00:20:09,199 --> 00:20:10,063
Really?

262
00:20:10,191 --> 00:20:12,203
- Yes.
- All right.

263
00:20:24,388 --> 00:20:26,128
Is it fun?

264
00:20:31,591 --> 00:20:33,887
We will soon send our employees.

265
00:20:34,015 --> 00:20:36,754
We'll finalize all the details then.

266
00:20:36,882 --> 00:20:38,751
Thank you.

267
00:20:40,228 --> 00:20:41,604
Manager.

268
00:20:41,886 --> 00:20:43,344
Manager?

269
00:20:46,173 --> 00:20:49,025
You must really like children.

270
00:20:49,854 --> 00:20:50,834
Yes.

271
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:52,361
He's cute.

272
00:21:03,456 --> 00:21:06,710
You only were able to
retrieve 40 percent of the funds this month?

273
00:21:06,881 --> 00:21:12,126
Seems like a significant portion of our
capital has moved towards Noh Gapsoo.

274
00:21:12,968 --> 00:21:14,865
Jong-Ro in particular.

275
00:21:14,965 --> 00:21:19,943
If this keeps up, it's only a matter
of time before we lose all clients there.

276
00:21:21,983 --> 00:21:24,393
Send some of the boys
and check the situation there.

277
00:21:24,493 --> 00:21:26,251
Yes, Director.

278
00:21:34,311 --> 00:21:35,637
What is it?

279
00:21:35,765 --> 00:21:38,533
A guest is waiting for you.

280
00:21:40,016 --> 00:21:41,709
A guest?

281
00:21:42,232 --> 00:21:43,664
Who is that?

282
00:21:54,033 --> 00:21:56,449
How have you been, Director Yoo?

283
00:22:02,497 --> 00:22:04,366
What brings you here?

284
00:22:04,965 --> 00:22:08,488
President Noh Gapsoo sent me here.

285
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,776
He voiced his concerns about you,

286
00:22:13,975 --> 00:22:17,068
saying you might be facing
severe cash flow problems.

287
00:22:17,487 --> 00:22:19,006
And?

288
00:22:19,374 --> 00:22:22,307
If you give up Jong-Ro,

289
00:22:23,088 --> 00:22:28,097
he said he's prepared to help
you with those cash flow issues.

290
00:22:31,089 --> 00:22:33,192
Go tell President Noh.

291
00:22:33,976 --> 00:22:36,187
That if he truly wishes to see my downfall,

292
00:22:36,692 --> 00:22:40,615
he better stop kidding with me
and start fighting for real.

293
00:22:41,949 --> 00:22:44,791
I might not be able to guarantee victory,

294
00:22:45,108 --> 00:22:51,310
but I am pretty confident
that I could cripple him for life.

295
00:22:52,473 --> 00:22:54,610
You know that Madam Oh Namsuk...

296
00:22:55,527 --> 00:22:58,857
died because of you, right?

297
00:23:02,874 --> 00:23:05,000
On her way to meet you,

298
00:23:05,294 --> 00:23:09,463
my mother had a car accident and died.

299
00:23:10,403 --> 00:23:12,834
You and your husband,

300
00:23:13,163 --> 00:23:16,041
along with your daughter, Hwang Jeongyeon.

301
00:23:18,661 --> 00:23:24,112
I'm sure she would have had a
lot to talk about with you all.

302
00:23:25,285 --> 00:23:27,788
But she wasn't able to say a single thing,

303
00:23:28,469 --> 00:23:30,631
and suffered a violent death.

304
00:23:32,005 --> 00:23:33,391
So?

305
00:23:34,437 --> 00:23:39,683
Did you come here to express
your indignation about that?

306
00:23:41,492 --> 00:23:43,583
Not at all.

307
00:23:46,167 --> 00:23:49,411
I actually came here to thank you.

308
00:23:50,915 --> 00:23:55,895
Thank you for finally making a decent
man out of this miserable prick,

309
00:23:56,119 --> 00:23:58,010
Director Yoo Gyeongok.

310
00:24:31,086 --> 00:24:35,017
I never imagined you'd have the
guts to make that report to him.

311
00:24:35,416 --> 00:24:37,495
I said nothing wrong.

312
00:24:37,675 --> 00:24:42,334
How can you be sure that there are no
ruling party members supporting the amendment?

313
00:24:42,557 --> 00:24:46,116
Then, you could have offered a rebuttal.

314
00:24:46,269 --> 00:24:48,724
I don't like your political philosophy.

315
00:24:48,783 --> 00:24:50,674
And what would that be?

316
00:24:50,862 --> 00:24:53,563
Is it not to avoid all
obstacles and go the distance?

317
00:24:53,928 --> 00:24:55,871
You forgot something.

318
00:24:56,186 --> 00:24:57,926
The fact that I never
swim against the tide.

319
00:24:58,009 --> 00:25:03,682
And that "tide" would be made of all the
propaganda bandied about on the street?

320
00:25:03,764 --> 00:25:06,690
That is subjective.

321
00:25:06,791 --> 00:25:09,278
Whether it is right or wrong,

322
00:25:09,607 --> 00:25:12,485
that is up to history to judge.

323
00:25:26,086 --> 00:25:33,603
We're still a long way from reaching
the quorum necessary for the amendment.

324
00:25:35,141 --> 00:25:37,784
Things are proceeding
a lot faster than I imagined.

325
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,907
Have you met with the
opposition party members?

326
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:49,383
After they verified the account that
day, their attitude completely changed.

327
00:25:49,994 --> 00:25:53,636
If the ruling party does its part,
I think we might succeed.

328
00:25:53,753 --> 00:25:58,217
Now that we got to this point, we must
push ahead and bring it to fruition.

329
00:25:58,322 --> 00:26:00,989
Or else we will all die for it.

330
00:26:01,118 --> 00:26:03,383
So I was wondering...

331
00:26:03,488 --> 00:26:10,858
How about I take care of dealing with the
opposition party from now on?

332
00:26:13,007 --> 00:26:18,063
I think that it will be a
much safer way to proceed.

333
00:26:18,174 --> 00:26:22,245
Why, are you looking to be
recommended by the opposition party,

334
00:26:22,348 --> 00:26:25,539
should you decide to enter politics?

335
00:26:30,625 --> 00:26:33,106
If your target is Jo Pilyeon,

336
00:26:33,211 --> 00:26:37,358
I suppose it would be easier to
go at him from the opposition party.

337
00:26:37,569 --> 00:26:41,680
There is still a lot of work to do,

338
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:47,027
so I'll refrain from making any
proclamations, if you'll forgive me.

339
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,805
You start drinking without me...

340
00:26:53,922 --> 00:26:56,013
Would it taste as good?

341
00:26:56,189 --> 00:26:58,352
Come on in, Congressman.

342
00:26:59,597 --> 00:27:02,862
I've just heard the
news from Chairman Hwang.

343
00:27:03,203 --> 00:27:07,463
With someone of your
political acumen helping us,

344
00:27:07,562 --> 00:27:08,947
I suddenly feel empowered.

345
00:27:09,064 --> 00:27:12,490
I've been to the Blue House today.

346
00:27:12,597 --> 00:27:17,748
The president seems to be nervous
to an unprecedented extent.

347
00:27:18,041 --> 00:27:22,752
And what I mean is that it could
suddenly lead him to take drastic measures.

348
00:27:22,834 --> 00:27:26,624
So act with the utmost prudence.

349
00:27:32,145 --> 00:27:36,032
This month alone, sales
have increased 140 percent.

350
00:27:36,146 --> 00:27:38,333
140 percent?!

351
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:40,929
My... What is this...

352
00:27:41,058 --> 00:27:43,043
Come on in.

353
00:27:45,631 --> 00:27:48,306
Is there any particular
model you were looking for?

354
00:27:54,908 --> 00:27:56,355
Yes... I'd like to see these.

355
00:27:56,566 --> 00:27:58,528
Have a seat.

356
00:28:03,696 --> 00:28:05,596
How do they feel?

357
00:28:06,563 --> 00:28:09,343
They're quite comfortable,
and I like the design.

358
00:28:09,684 --> 00:28:10,835
Director Moon.

359
00:28:10,946 --> 00:28:11,586
Yes, Chairman.

360
00:28:11,645 --> 00:28:15,783
Buy all shoes of this size on display.

361
00:28:15,906 --> 00:28:17,827
All right, Chairman.

362
00:28:18,323 --> 00:28:20,152
Right away.

363
00:28:23,676 --> 00:28:25,532
Seonhwa, aren't you hungry?

364
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:28,028
Right... Let's go eat something.

365
00:28:28,134 --> 00:28:31,329
- Let's go have lunch, then.
- Yes.

366
00:28:45,784 --> 00:28:47,695
What's with him?

367
00:28:47,894 --> 00:28:50,279
He gets on my nerves.

368
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:57,919
I'll go to the lady's room a moment.

369
00:29:08,115 --> 00:29:10,061
What's wrong with you?

370
00:29:11,212 --> 00:29:13,080
This will not make any difference.

371
00:29:13,174 --> 00:29:15,687
Don't you realize it'll only
make us more uncomfortable?

372
00:29:16,028 --> 00:29:19,986
I found a thing called hope these days.

373
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:25,371
An ardent wish.

374
00:29:27,967 --> 00:29:31,761
I wanted to tell you that.

375
00:30:14,726 --> 00:30:16,130
Yes...

376
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,961
Ohh... Jeongyeon!

377
00:30:19,665 --> 00:30:21,357
Nah, go ahead.

378
00:30:22,468 --> 00:30:23,436
Really?

379
00:30:23,542 --> 00:30:24,916
Where?

380
00:30:47,338 --> 00:30:50,122
Did you find the
cause of those gas leaks?

381
00:30:50,439 --> 00:30:51,872
Not yet.

382
00:30:52,246 --> 00:30:54,337
How about Jo Minwoo's side?

383
00:30:56,076 --> 00:30:58,636
They stole our core
technology to develop theirs.

384
00:30:59,141 --> 00:31:01,021
But we can catch up to them.

385
00:31:03,593 --> 00:31:07,741
You still have that?

386
00:31:10,124 --> 00:31:11,841
The secret fund account.

387
00:31:13,556 --> 00:31:14,930
Why are you asking?

388
00:31:15,928 --> 00:31:19,053
Honestly, it worries me a little.

389
00:31:20,376 --> 00:31:25,029
If anything had gone wrong at the event...

390
00:31:25,933 --> 00:31:28,188
Sorry, Jeongyeon.

391
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:34,860
I still feel bad for getting
you involved in all that.

392
00:31:34,942 --> 00:31:37,761
That's not what I meant!

393
00:31:42,436 --> 00:31:44,081
Aren't you finishing it?

394
00:31:46,229 --> 00:31:48,445
I'm done.

395
00:31:52,025 --> 00:31:54,001
You know that I don't eat that much.

396
00:31:54,154 --> 00:31:55,963
I'm full.

397
00:31:56,691 --> 00:31:58,453
Eat...

398
00:31:58,859 --> 00:32:01,278
Have I ever complained
that you eat too much?

399
00:32:01,396 --> 00:32:03,099
Come on.

400
00:32:06,635 --> 00:32:09,442
Would be a waste, wouldn't it?

401
00:32:24,306 --> 00:32:27,674
I think I might have to
go back to the hospital, what do we do?

402
00:32:27,827 --> 00:32:29,096
I can't really drive you home.

403
00:32:29,201 --> 00:32:30,858
What am I, a little girl?

404
00:32:30,975 --> 00:32:34,429
Don't worry about me and
finish developing those boilers.

405
00:32:34,981 --> 00:32:36,402
I'm going.

406
00:33:23,805 --> 00:33:25,625
Who are you?

407
00:33:34,366 --> 00:33:35,595
Who are you?

408
00:33:35,665 --> 00:33:37,145
Answer me!

409
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:02,422
Look...

410
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,854
Wake up.

411
00:34:06,745 --> 00:34:08,623
Can... Can you...

412
00:34:09,668 --> 00:34:11,894
President Lee!

413
00:34:12,211 --> 00:34:13,021
What now...

414
00:34:13,127 --> 00:34:16,381
President Lee, get a hold of yourself!

415
00:34:27,214 --> 00:34:28,763
The hell is this?

416
00:34:28,951 --> 00:34:31,148
I guess it's data about boilers.

417
00:34:31,312 --> 00:34:32,181
You fool.

418
00:34:32,287 --> 00:34:34,284
What were you doing out there?

419
00:34:34,749 --> 00:34:36,152
I apologize.

420
00:34:36,828 --> 00:34:38,973
He didn't find out who you were, right?

421
00:34:40,289 --> 00:34:41,604
The ANSP?

422
00:34:41,754 --> 00:34:44,271
The way I see it, those
weren't just thieves.

423
00:34:44,927 --> 00:34:46,716
I'm sure it was them.

424
00:34:46,829 --> 00:34:50,017
Then, are you telling me
they already got a hold of this?

425
00:34:51,893 --> 00:34:55,933
I guess they got suspicious after
finding some clues at the event.

426
00:34:56,697 --> 00:35:01,337
All the more reason why
we must remain calm.

427
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:06,949
For the time being, you two
should remain together at all times.

428
00:35:07,197 --> 00:35:08,641
Yes, President.

429
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:11,295
You be careful as well.

430
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:12,388
Yeah.

431
00:35:12,893 --> 00:35:15,148
I'll focus my efforts
on our boiler development.

432
00:35:15,574 --> 00:35:17,312
If they don't find any solid clue,

433
00:35:17,489 --> 00:35:21,600
even the ANSP won't be able to do much.

434
00:35:31,182 --> 00:35:34,204
- Don't get up.
- You're here, President...

435
00:35:38,867 --> 00:35:39,842
How are you feeling?

436
00:35:39,983 --> 00:35:42,156
I'm fine,

437
00:35:42,438 --> 00:35:45,847
but I really have no excuses.

438
00:35:45,952 --> 00:35:47,926
As long as you're alive and well,

439
00:35:48,107 --> 00:35:50,146
we'll always find the time to
complete our boiler development.

440
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:54,551
But if there are any more
delays, you'll incur heavy losses.

441
00:36:00,145 --> 00:36:03,129
Don't you worry about that,
and focus on recovering.

442
00:36:03,422 --> 00:36:08,717
If the factory manager could still be with us...

443
00:36:48,871 --> 00:36:52,485
It's hair from that kid named Kang Wooju.

444
00:37:00,379 --> 00:37:02,950
How long will it take for those DNA tests?

445
00:37:03,068 --> 00:37:05,617
The research center in Chicago....

446
00:37:05,769 --> 00:37:09,387
said we'd have the
results in about two weeks.

447
00:37:20,733 --> 00:37:23,670
If possible, I'd like it done
in no more than ten days.

448
00:37:24,046 --> 00:37:25,667
I will try to press them.

449
00:37:26,465 --> 00:37:32,720
But if he does turn out to be your son,
how do you plan to proceed?

450
00:37:33,332 --> 00:37:34,776
I'll have to go get him, of course.

451
00:37:34,858 --> 00:37:38,385
- But, Miss Lee Miju...
- I will bring her as well.

452
00:37:38,494 --> 00:37:39,333
What?

453
00:37:39,439 --> 00:37:41,939
If she's indeed the mother of my child,

454
00:37:42,361 --> 00:37:46,614
then be it my father or Lee Gangmo,
nobody will be able to stop me.

455
00:37:46,684 --> 00:37:50,560
I'll protect my family.

456
00:38:00,911 --> 00:38:02,004
So I finally find you.

457
00:38:02,074 --> 00:38:04,635
I had something to give you.

458
00:38:06,267 --> 00:38:08,089
- Boiler Development Daily Report -

459
00:38:08,171 --> 00:38:12,000
It's Beaute Boilers' daily report.

460
00:38:14,314 --> 00:38:16,241
I took it from Lee Gangmo.

461
00:38:16,323 --> 00:38:19,612
I'm sure that it will be
of help, upon closer look.

462
00:38:20,391 --> 00:38:22,376
I see you wasted your time
with something I have no use for.

463
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,349
You have no use for it?!

464
00:38:24,984 --> 00:38:31,580
According to rumors, you're ignoring
business to focus on something else...

465
00:38:32,219 --> 00:38:34,683
Since you're here,
I'll go ahead and tell you.

466
00:38:35,094 --> 00:38:39,236
From here on in, don't
get involved in my business.

467
00:38:39,352 --> 00:38:40,098
What?

468
00:38:40,227 --> 00:38:43,105
Whatever the case,
I will decide and act upon it.

469
00:38:43,265 --> 00:38:46,350
You just focus on your political career.

470
00:38:46,448 --> 00:38:48,098
Minwoo, you...

471
00:38:49,437 --> 00:38:52,150
I'm busy, so if you'll excuse me...

472
00:38:59,057 --> 00:39:03,793
So Minwoo these days is fixing some...
what was it, a kindergarten?

473
00:39:03,887 --> 00:39:04,991
Yes.

474
00:39:05,507 --> 00:39:07,011
That's what his secretaries told me.

475
00:39:07,093 --> 00:39:10,265
The hell got into him?

476
00:39:15,076 --> 00:39:16,217
Come on in.

477
00:39:16,322 --> 00:39:18,578
Have you already talked
with our representatives?

478
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:21,091
Yes. Please come in.

479
00:39:21,197 --> 00:39:22,266
Yes.

480
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:39,012
Ajeosshi...

481
00:39:45,905 --> 00:39:47,009
What?

482
00:39:47,361 --> 00:39:49,429
Again with the wooden horse?

483
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,591
No way.

484
00:39:52,753 --> 00:39:55,389
Come on...

485
00:39:56,881 --> 00:39:58,256
I said no.

486
00:40:08,764 --> 00:40:10,148
Happy now?

487
00:40:10,418 --> 00:40:14,400
- Yes.
- All right... Ready...

488
00:40:18,483 --> 00:40:21,630
What on earth is he doing?

489
00:40:27,479 --> 00:40:29,418
Find out who that kid is.

490
00:40:29,652 --> 00:40:34,721
Whose son he is, and why
he's turning him into a raging fool.

491
00:40:34,815 --> 00:40:36,425
Dig up everything you can find.

492
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:38,269
All right, Congressman.

493
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:58,798
That boy can't possibly be...

494
00:40:59,121 --> 00:40:59,855
Nah.

495
00:40:59,926 --> 00:41:01,594
There is no way.

496
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:07,561
Seongmo said Lee Miju got an abortion.

497
00:41:11,425 --> 00:41:12,344
I'm back.

498
00:41:12,426 --> 00:41:13,368
Who is he?

499
00:41:13,459 --> 00:41:14,845
Who the hell is that boy?

500
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,301
Cha Soojeong's.... No.

501
00:41:18,089 --> 00:41:20,178
Lee Miju's son.

502
00:41:21,245 --> 00:41:24,477
Seems that Minwoo stopped
this celeb tabloid writer from...

503
00:41:24,947 --> 00:41:27,479
publishing a scoop about her.

504
00:41:33,552 --> 00:41:37,992
Then... Are you telling
me that he's Minwoo's son?

505
00:41:38,297 --> 00:41:43,609
We still have no research labs
able to verify whether their DNA matches.

506
00:41:43,773 --> 00:41:48,566
Minwoo will surely try to find that out.
Look into it.

507
00:41:48,766 --> 00:41:50,152
Yes, Congressman.

508
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:51,602
No!

509
00:41:52,283 --> 00:41:55,525
I'll have to first see that kid.

510
00:42:00,521 --> 00:42:02,467
Give it here... It's mine!

511
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:04,286
Try to get it if you can.

512
00:42:04,357 --> 00:42:06,189
I said it's mine!

513
00:42:12,015 --> 00:42:15,633
You couldn't get it
back, so now it's mine.

514
00:42:31,175 --> 00:42:32,690
Don't cry.

515
00:42:33,007 --> 00:42:35,180
They say crying is like admitting defeat.

516
00:42:35,699 --> 00:42:39,315
All you need to do
is getting it back later.

517
00:43:08,902 --> 00:43:11,024
What are you trying to say, Mom?

518
00:43:11,381 --> 00:43:14,019
Wooju disappeared?!

519
00:43:14,583 --> 00:43:17,437
Mom... Stop crying...
Just call the police station.

520
00:43:17,508 --> 00:43:19,645
I'll head there right away.

521
00:43:30,567 --> 00:43:32,416
How is this one?

522
00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:39,167
If you want anything else, just choose it.

523
00:43:43,982 --> 00:43:46,778
Not stuff for girls like this.

524
00:43:53,535 --> 00:43:55,849
- Follow him.
- Yes.

525
00:44:02,577 --> 00:44:04,585
Wooju!

526
00:44:04,924 --> 00:44:06,876
Kang Wooju!

527
00:44:08,645 --> 00:44:10,012
Wooju.

528
00:44:10,188 --> 00:44:11,868
Wooju.

529
00:44:13,254 --> 00:44:15,286
Kang Wooju!

530
00:44:16,087 --> 00:44:18,614
- Wooju.
- Mommy.

531
00:44:20,068 --> 00:44:21,809
Wooju!

532
00:44:29,227 --> 00:44:30,924
Where have you been?

533
00:44:31,033 --> 00:44:33,526
I told you not to
leave by yourself, didn't I?

534
00:44:34,589 --> 00:44:36,418
You'll have to get scolded.

535
00:44:36,524 --> 00:44:38,013
Will you do that again?

536
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:40,632
I won't.

537
00:44:44,127 --> 00:44:46,569
Don't you ever do that again, Wooju.

538
00:44:46,674 --> 00:44:48,453
Got it?

539
00:44:56,034 --> 00:44:57,547
Where did you get all this?

540
00:44:57,676 --> 00:45:01,341
Some ajeosshi bought them for me.

541
00:45:01,552 --> 00:45:02,833
Who?

542
00:45:04,994 --> 00:45:08,616
Grandma is worried,
so let's go back home.

543
00:45:15,083 --> 00:45:19,716
But we don't really know whether
that's really Minwoo's son.

544
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:22,008
It's his.

545
00:45:22,125 --> 00:45:22,936
What?

546
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:24,781
I'm sure of it.

547
00:45:24,895 --> 00:45:28,116
He looks just like
Minwoo when he was his age.

548
00:45:28,210 --> 00:45:29,267
Then...

549
00:45:29,431 --> 00:45:34,095
That brat gave birth to a child
that should have never been born.

550
00:45:35,347 --> 00:45:39,214
Nobody can find out about him.

551
00:45:39,331 --> 00:45:45,733
The secretary called me, saying Minwoo
contacted a research lab in the US for a DNA test.

552
00:45:46,203 --> 00:45:48,239
Have you found out which research lab it was?

553
00:45:48,322 --> 00:45:49,555
Yes.

554
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:52,092
I wrote it here.

555
00:46:33,568 --> 00:46:36,170
Seonbaenim, this...

556
00:46:46,113 --> 00:46:48,216
Did you check your brain at the door?

557
00:46:48,404 --> 00:46:50,048
I apologize.

558
00:46:52,807 --> 00:46:54,545
Chanseong.

559
00:46:55,109 --> 00:46:56,413
Yes, Chief.

560
00:46:56,651 --> 00:46:59,115
Take her to the gym.

561
00:46:59,303 --> 00:47:00,477
Yes.

562
00:47:01,910 --> 00:47:03,491
Follow me...

563
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:17,219
Only ever hold two targets at gunpoint.

564
00:47:18,088 --> 00:47:20,167
The one down at the shooting range,

565
00:47:20,884 --> 00:47:24,842
and your assaulter's chest.

566
00:47:25,570 --> 00:47:30,896
But you dared to point that
gun at a colleague of yours.

567
00:47:31,521 --> 00:47:34,300
If we measured our agents'
aptitude based on points,

568
00:47:34,467 --> 00:47:36,159
that would be grounds for immediate elimination.

569
00:47:36,335 --> 00:47:37,650
I... I will take steps to correct that.

570
00:47:37,697 --> 00:47:39,530
You have ten minutes.

571
00:47:39,941 --> 00:47:43,080
If you manage to take me down
in ten minutes, you'll be forgiven.

572
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:48,623
Or else, you will voluntarily
leave your current post.

573
00:47:49,444 --> 00:47:50,808
Keep track.

574
00:47:51,096 --> 00:47:52,124
All right.

575
00:47:52,265 --> 00:47:53,909
Ten minutes.

576
00:47:54,445 --> 00:47:56,308
Come get some.

577
00:48:53,829 --> 00:48:55,574
How much time left?

578
00:48:55,951 --> 00:48:57,477
Three minutes.

579
00:48:58,208 --> 00:48:59,626
Heard that?

580
00:49:00,225 --> 00:49:04,760
You only have three minutes to take me down.

581
00:49:23,533 --> 00:49:25,836
Are you giving up?

582
00:49:26,552 --> 00:49:29,691
I don't even know why
you bothered coming here.

583
00:49:29,785 --> 00:49:34,519
But what I'm sure of is that
you're not cut out to be an agent.

584
00:49:34,624 --> 00:49:36,422
Is that clear?

585
00:49:47,185 --> 00:49:49,363
Find yourself another post.

586
00:49:50,163 --> 00:49:52,476
You're out of my office starting now.

587
00:50:06,348 --> 00:50:08,378
I still have time, right?

588
00:50:08,749 --> 00:50:10,171
Y...eah...

589
00:50:11,099 --> 00:50:15,104
So I don't need to leave
your office now, right?

590
00:50:17,146 --> 00:50:19,438
You only told me to take
you down in ten minutes,

591
00:50:19,591 --> 00:50:22,660
you never said anything
about how I should do it.

592
00:50:33,091 --> 00:50:36,200
I'm hungry... Let's go eat.

593
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:54,165
Chief Lee.

594
00:50:54,318 --> 00:50:56,185
Outside the office, no titles.

595
00:50:57,136 --> 00:50:58,213
Seonbaenim...

596
00:50:58,325 --> 00:51:00,866
And I can tolerate that even less.

597
00:51:03,224 --> 00:51:04,927
Then, what else should I call you?

598
00:51:05,127 --> 00:51:06,772
Don't call me.

599
00:51:09,039 --> 00:51:11,353
I'll settle for "ajeosshi," then.

600
00:51:12,175 --> 00:51:13,414
What?

601
00:51:14,828 --> 00:51:19,118
I'm really sorry for hitting you down there.

602
00:51:19,981 --> 00:51:22,471
If you ever have trouble getting
married because of it, give me a call.

603
00:51:26,538 --> 00:51:28,406
This is good.

604
00:51:50,438 --> 00:51:52,543
Let's call it a day, Chanseong.

605
00:51:53,024 --> 00:51:54,081
Yes.

606
00:51:54,841 --> 00:51:57,206
Hey, newcomer.
Aren't you leaving?

607
00:51:57,347 --> 00:52:00,507
I'll have to turn in this report
and wait for them to examine it.

608
00:52:00,706 --> 00:52:03,901
Good job today, everyone.

609
00:52:10,514 --> 00:52:12,088
Thought she was just a blockhead,

610
00:52:12,206 --> 00:52:13,850
but turns out she's not your ordinary gal?

611
00:52:13,933 --> 00:52:18,596
From the very moment she came here,
I started getting these headaches...

612
00:52:19,179 --> 00:52:22,289
I'll have to meet Gangmo tonight.

613
00:52:22,453 --> 00:52:26,080
For the time being, I suggest you
refrain from visiting your brother.

614
00:52:26,811 --> 00:52:27,974
What do you mean?

615
00:52:28,127 --> 00:52:32,726
The ANSP has been trailing
President Lee for a few days.

616
00:52:32,854 --> 00:52:33,928
Who ordered that?

617
00:52:34,046 --> 00:52:37,205
It comes straight from Chief Oh,
so Jo Pilyeon must be behind it.

618
00:52:37,335 --> 00:52:39,308
Is Gangmo aware of that?

619
00:52:39,417 --> 00:52:43,266
I actually found out from him.

620
00:52:47,424 --> 00:52:51,226
If we claim we completed development
without finding the cause of our leaks,

621
00:52:51,369 --> 00:52:53,633
there's a good possibility they'll
leave us out of the New City project.

622
00:52:53,785 --> 00:52:56,114
It's all because I don't have a clue.

623
00:52:56,219 --> 00:53:01,686
I tried assembling it from scratch a
thousand times, but it is no use.

624
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:05,253
- Stop stuffing yourself, will you?
- Just checking how they taste.

625
00:53:08,147 --> 00:53:09,262
What's this?

626
00:53:09,391 --> 00:53:10,484
Is it someone's birthday?

627
00:53:10,555 --> 00:53:14,114
Gyeongja prepared all this for us.

628
00:53:14,238 --> 00:53:18,656
See? If it weren't for my Gyeongja,
who would ever worry about me?

629
00:53:20,327 --> 00:53:22,240
Look at your face, President...

630
00:53:22,322 --> 00:53:24,828
Eat all this by yourself and
regain your strength, President.

631
00:53:24,911 --> 00:53:27,904
What the hell...
Then, how about me?

632
00:53:27,996 --> 00:53:29,963
You have hands, so help
yourself or starve.

633
00:53:30,088 --> 00:53:33,027
- Have a seat, President.
- All right, thanks.

634
00:53:34,747 --> 00:53:38,159
Come on, let's all have a seat and eat.

635
00:53:39,754 --> 00:53:41,420
- By the way, Gyeongja.
- Uh?

636
00:53:41,538 --> 00:53:43,394
What's wrong with your face?

637
00:53:44,745 --> 00:53:46,916
It's all because of that damn Park Sotae.

638
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:49,674
Wh.... What?! Pa... Park Sotae?!

639
00:53:49,784 --> 00:53:54,055
So, what, you like him so much
that all those pimples started popping up?

640
00:53:54,166 --> 00:53:56,801
He only brings me cheap-ass
counterfeit cosmetics...

641
00:53:56,879 --> 00:53:59,789
And because of that, look at my face.

642
00:54:00,188 --> 00:54:05,764
Hey... Look at him. Doesn't all this
look like defective merchandise?

643
00:54:05,846 --> 00:54:08,387
Ehh... Really, I ought to just
throw that goddamned wig...

644
00:54:08,564 --> 00:54:10,138
Think I knew it was all counterfeit stuff?

645
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:12,722
That sorry-ass son of a
cunt said it was Made in USA,

646
00:54:12,816 --> 00:54:15,318
so I paid him all he asked.

647
00:54:15,870 --> 00:54:17,492
You still have those cosmetics?

648
00:54:17,617 --> 00:54:21,329
Sure! Wanted to try this crap out
on his damned mug, so I kept them.

649
00:54:21,498 --> 00:54:23,554
Here you go.

650
00:54:27,407 --> 00:54:29,748
This is original?!

651
00:54:29,842 --> 00:54:30,665
Right?!

652
00:54:30,817 --> 00:54:32,556
Isn't it? See?

653
00:54:32,638 --> 00:54:36,456
I guess it's too refined for someone's face...

654
00:54:36,667 --> 00:54:37,974
What?

655
00:54:38,078 --> 00:54:39,110
Are you done talking?

656
00:54:39,181 --> 00:54:41,107
Like I said anything wrong.

657
00:54:41,178 --> 00:54:47,243
- I guess your face is not good enough for it.
- You little rat...

658
00:55:04,331 --> 00:55:06,193
What's wrong with him?

659
00:55:08,326 --> 00:55:12,455
That was the reason
behind those gas leaks.

660
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:15,080
And what would that be?

661
00:55:15,534 --> 00:55:17,236
Gas.

662
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:20,104
Gas?!

663
00:55:20,212 --> 00:55:23,019
The gas Beaute Boilers used in Europe...

664
00:55:23,134 --> 00:55:26,960
and gas used in Korea are different.

665
00:55:27,970 --> 00:55:29,556
So...

666
00:55:30,474 --> 00:55:32,539
If this is a boiler,

667
00:55:32,692 --> 00:55:35,627
then this would be gas?

668
00:55:35,934 --> 00:55:38,274
Everyone, gather at the factory.

669
00:55:39,704 --> 00:55:42,265
Gangmo! Let's finish this first!

670
00:55:42,453 --> 00:55:46,145
- Gangmo!
- Aigoo, see? He works too damn hard.

671
00:55:49,419 --> 00:55:53,326
Hey! Stop eating, will you?
Move your ass. You still can eat after that?

672
00:55:53,490 --> 00:55:56,374
Ahh... That bowling ball...

673
00:55:59,463 --> 00:56:01,184
Wait... Forgot.

674
00:56:02,417 --> 00:56:04,249
See you.

675
00:56:10,634 --> 00:56:12,213
Your guest is here.

676
00:56:12,309 --> 00:56:14,104
Send him in.

677
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:24,840
How have you been?

678
00:56:25,111 --> 00:56:28,845
So the man President
Noh sent was you?

679
00:56:29,022 --> 00:56:30,563
Yes, Congressman.

680
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:32,407
Have a seat.

681
00:56:36,659 --> 00:56:38,597
According to President Noh,

682
00:56:38,750 --> 00:56:44,288
you bear a grudge against Chairman
Hwang, his daughter and Yoo Gyeongok?

683
00:56:44,415 --> 00:56:47,821
Does my bearing a grudge
against them look strange to you?

684
00:56:47,951 --> 00:56:50,770
Nah... That's not what I meant.

685
00:56:51,121 --> 00:56:55,434
At times, blood ties can be a lot
more intense than people can imagine.

686
00:56:55,550 --> 00:57:00,063
I've heard from President
Noh what you're looking for.

687
00:57:00,204 --> 00:57:05,537
So? Would you be able to do that for me?

688
00:57:05,701 --> 00:57:11,768
What you want is something I desire as well.

689
00:57:14,176 --> 00:57:17,265
If you do it, things
might be easier for us all.

690
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:18,780
I like it.

691
00:57:18,921 --> 00:57:22,922
Instead, I have a request as well.

692
00:57:23,074 --> 00:57:24,472
Tell me.

693
00:57:25,012 --> 00:57:27,514
If you like the way I work,

694
00:57:27,866 --> 00:57:31,555
give me info on all construction
projects around Gangnam,

695
00:57:31,708 --> 00:57:33,374
including the New City one.

696
00:57:33,653 --> 00:57:37,072
You've changed a lot over the years.

697
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:40,220
I left my soul back in hell.

698
00:57:40,878 --> 00:57:45,000
People can always change.

699
00:57:48,804 --> 00:57:52,941
These days, Chairman Hwang is
meeting with opposition party members.

700
00:57:53,067 --> 00:57:56,298
I'm sure it has to do with
the constitutional amendment.

701
00:57:56,439 --> 00:58:02,040
And if you dig deeper, you'll also
hear of a secret fund account.

702
00:58:03,763 --> 00:58:09,592
I know that Yoo Gyeongok is backing
him, and Hwang Jeongyeon is helping her.

703
00:58:10,163 --> 00:58:12,658
Find out everything regarding that account.

704
00:58:12,776 --> 00:58:13,785
Is that clear?

705
00:58:13,937 --> 00:58:15,547
I understand.

706
00:58:17,978 --> 00:58:20,128
Here... Let's have a drink.

707
01:00:30,453 --> 01:00:32,980
When did you say the conference was?

708
01:00:33,103 --> 01:00:34,192
In three days.

709
01:00:34,309 --> 01:00:36,619
So if we can't finish the boiler by then,

710
01:00:36,744 --> 01:00:39,326
will they exclude us from the selection?

711
01:00:40,219 --> 01:00:42,157
Let's just go at it until the end, uh?

712
01:00:42,286 --> 01:00:46,350
Let's just reassemble it from scratch.

713
01:00:46,491 --> 01:00:48,101
All right.

714
01:00:48,363 --> 01:00:50,865
We can't let them exclude us this way.

715
01:00:51,006 --> 01:00:53,378
We spent so much acquiring this company...

716
01:00:53,484 --> 01:00:56,879
I'll go take a little breather.

717
01:01:06,144 --> 01:01:08,669
He's had it as well, I guess...

718
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:13,540
No matter what Gangmo says,
this is not going to work.

719
01:01:13,697 --> 01:01:17,159
Is reading a few books
going to help us develop a boiler?

720
01:01:17,218 --> 01:01:21,787
Ahh... If that sorry-ass factory
manager hadn't stolen our technology...

721
01:01:32,176 --> 01:01:33,783
Who's there?

722
01:02:41,212 --> 01:02:42,988
Who are you?

723
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:50,366
You...

724
01:02:53,819 --> 01:02:56,301
What else are you here
to steal this time?

725
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:07,800
Here are the schematics for Manbo
Construction's new boiler.

726
01:03:08,564 --> 01:03:11,951
I came in to leave this here in secret...

727
01:03:13,012 --> 01:03:16,007

Wooju.

733
01:03:41,674 --> 01:03:44,497
Whenever we meet, just call me Daddy.

734
01:03:44,607 --> 01:03:45,351
Promise.

735
01:03:45,445 --> 01:03:47,346
The hell are you looking at, you losers?

736
01:03:47,439 --> 01:03:48,320
I apologize.

737
01:03:48,414 --> 01:03:49,754
You can find your way back home, right?

738
01:03:49,824 --> 01:03:53,157
I can do that.

739
01:03:53,253 --> 01:03:54,593
They're the DNA test results.

740
01:03:54,675 --> 01:03:57,142
Wooju is not your son?!

741
01:03:57,259 --> 01:04:00,754
Hangang Construction will be
added to the list of companies to oust.

742
01:04:00,887 --> 01:04:03,211
Start by stopping his boiler development.

743
01:04:03,305 --> 01:04:06,300
How about you just
set his factory on fire instead?

744
01:04:06,429 --> 01:04:09,718
Whatever I end up
doing, don't resent me.

745
01:04:09,859 --> 01:04:13,512
Because Lee Miju, you
brought this upon yourself.
