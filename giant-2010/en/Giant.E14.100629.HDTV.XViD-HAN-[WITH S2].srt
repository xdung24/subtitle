4
00:00:19,157 --> 00:00:21,543
Who are you?

5
00:00:30,362 --> 00:00:33,793
Chairman Park,
you're better than I thought?

6
00:00:37,295 --> 00:00:39,422
<i>What are you people...</i>

7
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:43,007
We have something to investigate,
so you'll have to follow us.

8
00:00:43,097 --> 00:00:45,491
- What?!
- And you are?

9
00:00:49,155 --> 00:00:52,132
- Proceed!
- What are you doing?

10
00:00:53,023 --> 00:00:57,631
How dare you?
At least tell us the reason!

11
00:00:57,782 --> 00:01:00,098
<i>Who do you think you're dealing with?</i>

12
00:01:04,113 --> 00:01:05,536
What's the matter?

13
00:01:05,629 --> 00:01:07,092
Just performing our duties.

14
00:01:07,185 --> 00:01:11,523
Do you even know who
the VIPs we have here are?

15
00:01:11,632 --> 00:01:15,199
If we interfered with your business,
let me apologize.

16
00:01:25,037 --> 00:01:27,062
They're KCIA agents.

17
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,059
The Central Intelligence Agency?

18
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:31,054
<i>That's right.</i>

19
00:01:36,841 --> 00:01:38,682
I have nothing to do with this, Dad.

20
00:01:38,775 --> 00:01:40,639
I didn't do it.

21
00:01:40,712 --> 00:01:44,616
Honey... Even the subway issue
concluded in your favor.

22
00:01:44,721 --> 00:01:48,284
Just forgive Jeongshik, will you?

23
00:01:48,468 --> 00:01:50,007
<i>Honey...</i>

24
00:01:50,101 --> 00:01:53,704
You said you wanted to
come back to work, didn't you?

25
00:01:53,783 --> 00:01:54,878
Yes, Dad.

26
00:01:54,972 --> 00:01:57,172
I'll give my very best.

27
00:01:57,267 --> 00:01:59,338
- Gangmo.
- Yes, Chairman.

28
00:01:59,435 --> 00:02:03,267
Jeongshik will work in
Goods & Services with you.

29
00:02:03,452 --> 00:02:07,838
Show him what kind of
trade we're dealing with.

30
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:09,961
- Goods & Services?!
- Dad...

31
00:02:10,055 --> 00:02:14,717
He needs to taste once and for all
what hard work feels like.

32
00:02:14,848 --> 00:02:19,167
Still, be that as it may,
are you forcing chores on our Jeongshik?

33
00:02:19,298 --> 00:02:22,484
If he doesn't like it, he can
pack his bags and get out of here!

34
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:25,096
Aigoo... You're really something.

35
00:02:25,204 --> 00:02:27,006
How can you treat your
one and only son like that?

36
00:02:27,085 --> 00:02:29,529
<i>What do you think you're doing?</i>

37
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,964
<i>Who are you people?</i>

38
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:34,487
I said no!

39
00:02:35,506 --> 00:02:37,119
What is the matter?

40
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,338
Chairman Hwang.

41
00:02:38,429 --> 00:02:40,552
You'll have to follow us and
collaborate with our investigations.

42
00:02:40,644 --> 00:02:43,553
What are you investigating?

43
00:02:44,383 --> 00:02:48,280
I did nothing that would
warrant a KCIA investigation.

44
00:02:48,398 --> 00:02:50,005
Escort him out.

45
00:02:52,374 --> 00:02:53,915
Let go, you fool!

46
00:02:54,222 --> 00:02:57,244
I'll come on my own,
so get your hands off of me!

47
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:05,622
I hope it wasn't Director
Jo Pilyeon who sent you here?

48
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,180
You'll find out when we get there.

49
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:14,576
- What is all this about?
- Ajeosshi...

50
00:03:14,655 --> 00:03:18,168
How can you do this to him?

51
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:23,292
What is all this?
Why would they take you to the KCIA?

52
00:03:23,424 --> 00:03:26,610
What did he ever do wrong?

53
00:03:26,768 --> 00:03:28,743
What's the reason?

54
00:03:28,848 --> 00:03:30,933
Stop acting like a ninny.

55
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:34,422
Let's go, or we'll wake up
the entire neighborhood.

56
00:03:41,505 --> 00:03:43,410
- Dear...
- Dad.

57
00:03:43,502 --> 00:03:48,821
Just in case, Jeongyeon,
you preside over tomorrow's board meeting.

58
00:03:48,939 --> 00:03:50,320
Dad...

59
00:03:51,033 --> 00:03:52,363
Gangmo.

60
00:03:52,469 --> 00:03:56,055
- Help out Jeongyeon.
- Chairman...

61
00:03:56,555 --> 00:04:00,057
Don't you worry.
I'll be back in no time.

62
00:04:00,308 --> 00:04:02,124
Let's go.

63
00:04:10,721 --> 00:04:12,360
Nothing will happen to him.

64
00:04:12,467 --> 00:04:13,735
That's right, Ma'am.

65
00:04:13,827 --> 00:04:17,806
No matter how serious this is,
he's innocent anyway.

66
00:04:17,898 --> 00:04:20,677
I can't really
figure out what's going on.

67
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:22,889
Let's just go back in, Jeongshik.

68
00:04:24,949 --> 00:04:28,894
- Come with me.
- Yes, all right.

69
00:04:52,432 --> 00:04:53,536
The chairman?

70
00:04:53,633 --> 00:04:55,742
What is going on?

71
00:04:56,085 --> 00:04:57,072
I'm one step late...

72
00:04:57,177 --> 00:04:58,937
You should be aware of what's going on.

73
00:04:59,042 --> 00:05:02,018
Why did they arrest my father?

74
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:12,492
Are you telling me Dad is involved
with Chairman Hong's account?

75
00:05:12,589 --> 00:05:14,974
He presided over
the construction committee,

76
00:05:15,221 --> 00:05:17,249
so his name surely
ended up on that account.

77
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:20,635
Does that mean he might be charged?

78
00:05:24,239 --> 00:05:26,390
First he takes all that money,

79
00:05:26,504 --> 00:05:30,373
and now he has the guts to
blame everything on my father?

80
00:05:30,602 --> 00:05:33,306
Seems like the situation
got a little complicated.

81
00:05:34,215 --> 00:05:36,095
But don't worry too much.

82
00:05:36,282 --> 00:05:41,983
It's the chairman I'm working for,
so nothing serious will happen.

83
00:05:43,071 --> 00:05:45,408
<i>Jeongyeon came here as my woman.</i>

84
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:48,528
And they say it runs in the family...

85
00:05:49,239 --> 00:05:52,254
Since when did you
start seducing Jo Minwoo?

86
00:05:52,517 --> 00:05:53,424
What?

87
00:05:53,533 --> 00:05:54,795
Minwoo.

88
00:05:54,913 --> 00:05:57,458
Let me give you an advice.

89
00:05:58,227 --> 00:06:00,554
You know, her real mother?!

90
00:06:04,462 --> 00:06:07,196
I don't care whether
you believe me or not.

91
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,907
And that's because I love you.

92
00:06:15,706 --> 00:06:17,229
Nothing will happen.

93
00:06:17,404 --> 00:06:21,239
Tell your family not to worry.

94
00:06:25,735 --> 00:06:28,150
Thank you for your help.

95
00:06:51,388 --> 00:06:56,087
I never imagined Dad would
bribe his way to the top.

96
00:06:56,532 --> 00:06:59,848
It's not something he's proud of,

97
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:02,857
since he was forced to do it,
for the survival of his company.

98
00:07:03,002 --> 00:07:05,003
I know.

99
00:07:05,603 --> 00:07:08,646
And that only makes me feel worse.

100
00:07:10,016 --> 00:07:15,190
Since Minwoo's father works
for the KCIA, he'll help us out.

101
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:19,705
Jo Minwoo is not to be trusted.

102
00:07:20,772 --> 00:07:25,766
Director Jo might in fact
be behind all this.

103
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:27,373
What are you trying to say?

104
00:07:27,544 --> 00:07:29,534
Why would he?

105
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,954
I'll look into it.

106
00:07:36,523 --> 00:07:39,011
KCIA agents searched
Chairman Hong's house?!

107
00:07:39,132 --> 00:07:44,178
Aigoo... As if that would help them...
They turned the damned thing upside down.

108
00:07:46,057 --> 00:07:51,297
So that means they still haven't
found Chairman Hong's account.

109
00:07:51,455 --> 00:07:56,480
They said to call them when they
find it, so I guess that's true.

110
00:07:56,651 --> 00:07:59,077
So how many people were they?

111
00:07:59,181 --> 00:08:01,891
Just his wife... No... Wait...

112
00:08:02,049 --> 00:08:05,031
With the housemaid, that's two in total.

113
00:08:05,657 --> 00:08:08,365
One of them must be carrying that account.

114
00:08:08,477 --> 00:08:11,018
Seemed like they had no idea?!

115
00:08:11,165 --> 00:08:13,531
You come with me, starting tomorrow.

116
00:08:13,627 --> 00:08:14,548
What, again?!

117
00:08:14,614 --> 00:08:18,525
Forget it, you go by yourself.
I'm starving in here...

118
00:08:19,591 --> 00:08:22,580
So you have no problem letting
all your efforts go in vain?

119
00:08:22,858 --> 00:08:24,293
<i>If we don't get our hands
on that account,</i>

120
00:08:24,372 --> 00:08:26,268
forget the subway construction,
it's all over!

121
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,003
So at least let's see
some food on the table.

122
00:08:30,165 --> 00:08:35,313
Let's talk again after he gives me
a decent meal, I'm starving here...

123
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:37,420
<i>Isn't that right?</i>

124
00:08:46,404 --> 00:08:48,462
Are you out of your mind?

125
00:08:48,571 --> 00:08:51,426
What kind of mess
are you trying to make?

126
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:55,183
It's just as the report
you received suggests.

127
00:08:55,473 --> 00:08:58,524
As the title suggests,
it's a "national development fund."

128
00:08:58,631 --> 00:09:03,280
Don't you know it's not just me,
but it's closely tied to the president?

129
00:09:03,464 --> 00:09:07,865
Hong Gipyo already made
contacts with the opposition.

130
00:09:07,979 --> 00:09:09,114
What?

131
00:09:09,211 --> 00:09:12,565
Did they already
get a hold of all this?

132
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:14,717
If the opposition clings onto this,

133
00:09:14,862 --> 00:09:17,666
they'll turn public sentiment
against the president in no time.

134
00:09:17,785 --> 00:09:19,983
So when even keeping quiet is risky,

135
00:09:20,076 --> 00:09:21,999
what would you accomplish
by revealing this to everyone?

136
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:27,089
There is such a thing as
"sacrificial lambs" in the Bible.

137
00:09:29,622 --> 00:09:31,062
Sacrificial lamb?!

138
00:09:31,386 --> 00:09:33,326
Kill one lamb,

139
00:09:33,419 --> 00:09:37,542
and its blood will atone
for all your sins.

140
00:09:37,724 --> 00:09:42,777
So you're suggesting we
blame all this on a scapegoat?

141
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:44,994
Think about it.

142
00:09:45,257 --> 00:09:51,223
Isn't Min Honggi the only one who
directly received money from Hong Gipyo?

143
00:09:51,936 --> 00:09:57,361
So, what, let's sacrifice
Director Min at the altar?

144
00:09:57,485 --> 00:10:00,205
Isn't that what politics is all about?

145
00:10:00,336 --> 00:10:05,128
One hand takes you in,
the other brings punishment.

146
00:10:06,937 --> 00:10:09,451
What do you think about this?

147
00:10:10,824 --> 00:10:17,947
The president always mentions our war
on corruption in every single speech.

148
00:10:21,626 --> 00:10:24,261
You really are scary.

149
00:10:24,371 --> 00:10:27,156
I'm only doing this
for our country's sake.

150
00:10:27,301 --> 00:10:32,067
Just ignore all this and leave it to me.

151
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:35,919
Still, let's keep things clean.

152
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:40,987
A single slip,
and all our heads will roll.

153
00:10:41,444 --> 00:10:49,190
When all this is said and done, I'll run
for the elections in Min Honggi's place.

154
00:11:01,191 --> 00:11:03,255
Good job, Chanseong.

155
00:11:03,439 --> 00:11:05,509
What do you plan to do with this?

156
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,155
It's easy to guess what
Jo Pilyeon's true motives are.

157
00:11:08,383 --> 00:11:10,248
We can't allow him to
just eliminate Min Honggi...

158
00:11:10,393 --> 00:11:15,966
and turn Hwang Taeseop
into a lackey of his.

159
00:11:16,137 --> 00:11:17,973
Be careful, Seonbaenim.

160
00:11:18,259 --> 00:11:22,394
From the very first moment I joined
the KCIA, I put my life on the line.

161
00:11:22,574 --> 00:11:24,184
But forget that,

162
00:11:25,356 --> 00:11:28,643
I'm thankful for all
the help you've given me.

163
00:11:29,516 --> 00:11:31,267
I told you.

164
00:11:31,425 --> 00:11:35,357
I must avenge my brother, too.

165
00:11:49,115 --> 00:11:50,643
Hyung!

166
00:12:01,236 --> 00:12:02,742
Hyung...

167
00:12:02,979 --> 00:12:11,709
They'll bury me in the state
cemetery like my father, right?

168
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:17,502
Hyung...

169
00:12:18,187 --> 00:12:19,687
<i>Hyung.</i>

170
00:12:21,105 --> 00:12:23,225
Hyung!

171
00:12:30,677 --> 00:12:32,678
If it weren't for you,

172
00:12:32,873 --> 00:12:37,289
I would have never learned
that my brother died that way.

173
00:12:39,171 --> 00:12:41,304
I'm sorry, Chanseong.

174
00:12:42,858 --> 00:12:45,386
It's not your fault.

175
00:12:45,942 --> 00:12:51,154
I will make Jo Pilyeon pay
for what he did to my brother.

176
00:12:57,012 --> 00:13:00,778
Jo Pilyeon even went as far as
arresting all committee members.

177
00:13:01,012 --> 00:13:03,961
This is not the time for indifference!

178
00:13:04,115 --> 00:13:08,183
What am I supposed to do,
barge in and interfere with KCIA duty?

179
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:12,897
<i>If that secret account is ever exposed,
it'll be the end for all of us.</i>

180
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:16,109
Then, take Hong Gipyo in
and investigate on your own.

181
00:13:16,349 --> 00:13:18,709
I'm busy, so I'll have to hang up.

182
00:13:19,693 --> 00:13:21,168
Congressman.

183
00:13:21,392 --> 00:13:23,195
Congressman!

184
00:13:24,077 --> 00:13:26,494
Goddamn...

185
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:30,792
Who is it?

186
00:13:35,835 --> 00:13:37,625
What is it, now?

187
00:13:44,313 --> 00:13:48,443
It's intel proving how Hong Gipyo's
maternal uncle defected to the north.

188
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:49,453
So?

189
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:53,589
As long as it's corruption, it's the
Inspection Department's jurisdiction,

190
00:13:53,695 --> 00:13:58,580
but if it involves espionage, isn't that
a case for our Intelligence Department?

191
00:14:02,242 --> 00:14:06,416
So you're going to corner
Hong Gipyo for espionage?

192
00:14:06,704 --> 00:14:11,550
The director will
assign this case to us.

193
00:14:24,413 --> 00:14:26,112
What's the reason?

194
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,496
I'm asking you why you're helping me.

195
00:14:31,358 --> 00:14:35,033
I'd like to leave the KCIA as well.

196
00:14:35,113 --> 00:14:38,692
Are you implying you'll abandon
Jo Pilyeon and follow me?

197
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:44,564
Because I feel your path
to success will be much quicker.

198
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:54,163
Bribes?!

199
00:14:54,374 --> 00:14:56,913
I devote my hard-earned
money to your cause,

200
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,100
and now you just call it bribes?

201
00:14:59,193 --> 00:15:02,819
Forgot who made your business flourish?

202
00:15:02,913 --> 00:15:07,048
Then, arrest everyone
else involved, at least.

203
00:15:07,141 --> 00:15:10,837
Once the account is in my hands,
that is what I plan to do.

204
00:15:11,601 --> 00:15:16,129
Although it will only be
Min Honggi and no one else.

205
00:15:17,841 --> 00:15:19,644
Do you understand now?

206
00:15:19,829 --> 00:15:24,175
All the money you donated has
nothing to do with the government.

207
00:15:24,268 --> 00:15:26,146
You gave it to Min Honggi.

208
00:15:26,248 --> 00:15:30,153
You're nothing but Min Honggi's sponsor.

209
00:15:30,403 --> 00:15:31,969
Spon...

210
00:15:33,068 --> 00:15:40,501
So, now that you're holding the knife,
you play judge, jury and executioner?

211
00:15:40,883 --> 00:15:45,608
Because we need a scapegoat.

212
00:15:46,096 --> 00:15:50,927
And that could be you, Hwang Taeseop.

213
00:15:52,737 --> 00:15:55,952
Director.

214
00:15:56,076 --> 00:15:59,333
Aren't you being excessive?

215
00:15:59,461 --> 00:16:01,412
Let's make things clear.

216
00:16:01,505 --> 00:16:04,141
The first to abandon me
like a pair of worn-out shoes,

217
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,103
Hwang Taeseop,
it was none other than you.

218
00:16:06,274 --> 00:16:09,578
You were talking about
running as an independent,

219
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:11,738
so if I have to give you my own blood,

220
00:16:11,856 --> 00:16:14,115
we at least need
a good chance of success.

221
00:16:14,233 --> 00:16:18,121
Since when have you been so calculating?

222
00:16:18,213 --> 00:16:19,184
Director...

223
00:16:19,368 --> 00:16:24,463
I will get to the bottom of this.

224
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:30,162
And you're no exception, Hwang Taeseop.

225
00:16:35,757 --> 00:16:37,254
Director!

226
00:16:42,195 --> 00:16:43,218
What?

227
00:16:43,304 --> 00:16:45,036
Min Honggi?

228
00:16:48,114 --> 00:16:50,141
Here... Let's go.

229
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:53,920
What do you think you're doing?

230
00:16:56,875 --> 00:17:00,201
We'll have to take
Chairman Hong into custody.

231
00:17:00,543 --> 00:17:01,597
And on whose authority?

232
00:17:01,702 --> 00:17:04,285
He's suspected of espionage.

233
00:17:04,393 --> 00:17:06,363
What? Espionage?!

234
00:17:06,468 --> 00:17:10,734
As you're well aware,
northern propaganda is our jurisdiction.

235
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:13,212
So you'll have to
step aside, I'm afraid.

236
00:17:13,306 --> 00:17:15,026
You son of a...

237
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:21,174
Can you see this?

238
00:17:21,669 --> 00:17:24,413
I just got the director's
consent on my way here.

239
00:17:24,624 --> 00:17:27,283
<i>If you have any objection,
go discuss it with him.</i>

240
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,659
Escort him out.

241
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:53,395
If we lose Hong Gipyo,
then our efforts will go in vain.

242
00:17:53,486 --> 00:17:55,557
We must find that account.

243
00:17:55,715 --> 00:17:57,288
We already looked for it, but...

244
00:17:57,432 --> 00:18:00,855
Even if you have to question his
whole clan and in-laws, just find it!

245
00:18:02,677 --> 00:18:05,702
<i>Here, have some coffee.</i>

246
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:10,708
You will not be subjected to any more
torture here, so you can rest assured.

247
00:18:11,243 --> 00:18:13,781
If you're going to ask about any account,

248
00:18:14,045 --> 00:18:15,859
just resign yourself.

249
00:18:15,979 --> 00:18:20,585
The only way you and I will survive...

250
00:18:20,692 --> 00:18:22,629
is if you give me that account.

251
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:24,077
Is that so?

252
00:18:24,577 --> 00:18:28,044
Then, why don't you just kill me?

253
00:18:28,244 --> 00:18:30,287
That will be much quicker.

254
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:40,774
<i>Here... At least a spoon.</i>

255
00:18:45,251 --> 00:18:47,360
Keep this up and you will really die!

256
00:18:47,445 --> 00:18:50,568
You haven't had
anything to eat all day.

257
00:18:52,466 --> 00:18:54,162
You don't like rice gruel?

258
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:57,817
Should I mix rice with water, then?

259
00:18:58,672 --> 00:19:01,292
You know where that account is, right?

260
00:19:01,398 --> 00:19:03,346
Wh...What are you talking about?

261
00:19:03,491 --> 00:19:04,900
How could I possibly know that?

262
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:08,514
No... You know.

263
00:19:08,665 --> 00:19:09,666
It's you...

264
00:19:09,824 --> 00:19:11,052
Right?

265
00:19:11,171 --> 00:19:13,054
The chairman entrusted it to you, right?

266
00:19:13,172 --> 00:19:14,502
I said it's not me.

267
00:19:14,607 --> 00:19:18,399
Without that account,
they said he'll die!

268
00:19:19,386 --> 00:19:20,584
Miju...

269
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:23,703
Let's bring it to them,

270
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,636
and take the chairman back home, uh?

271
00:19:25,734 --> 00:19:27,121
Ma'am.

272
00:19:27,229 --> 00:19:31,831
If this keeps up,
I'll get a heart attack.

273
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:33,839
Miju.

274
00:19:34,894 --> 00:19:39,519
They said he'll live,
if we bring that account to them!

275
00:19:39,614 --> 00:19:41,252
That's all a lie.

276
00:19:41,384 --> 00:19:43,927
The chairman said the opposite.

277
00:19:44,399 --> 00:19:45,810
What?

278
00:19:46,571 --> 00:19:48,726
What did you just say?

279
00:19:50,526 --> 00:19:53,009
So you really have it, don't you?

280
00:19:53,154 --> 00:19:55,092
Right?

281
00:19:59,148 --> 00:20:03,233
The chairman told me to
never give that to anyone.

282
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,775
<i>That if we hide the account,</i>

283
00:20:04,822 --> 00:20:06,823
<i>nothing will happen since
they'll have no evidence,</i>

284
00:20:06,942 --> 00:20:09,825
so he told me to hold it at all cost.

285
00:20:09,983 --> 00:20:13,986
And if my husband dies?

286
00:20:14,126 --> 00:20:17,237
What are you going to do, then?

287
00:20:17,488 --> 00:20:22,346
If I give that account to them,
the chairman will be in trouble.

288
00:20:24,873 --> 00:20:27,452
Honey...

289
00:20:51,994 --> 00:20:54,566
I fell asleep.

290
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:56,461
Go have a rest.

291
00:20:56,659 --> 00:20:58,847
I'll continue questioning him.

292
00:20:59,146 --> 00:21:02,348
Never seen anyone so stubborn before.

293
00:21:04,242 --> 00:21:08,896
I'll go get some shut-eye,
so just keep an eye on him for me.

294
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,549
You can wake up now.

295
00:21:40,691 --> 00:21:43,246
Nothing you try will be of any use,

296
00:21:43,479 --> 00:21:46,089
since I never wrote any account.

297
00:21:46,313 --> 00:21:51,132
Do you know when Shilla
unified the Three Kingdoms?

298
00:21:52,276 --> 00:21:58,330
Find the year when Shilla
unified the Three Kingdoms.

299
00:21:58,506 --> 00:22:03,269
That will tell you the
amount you're looking for.

300
00:22:07,975 --> 00:22:11,806
Remember my voice?

301
00:22:13,511 --> 00:22:15,111
Then...

302
00:22:15,651 --> 00:22:17,889
You are that...

303
00:22:41,742 --> 00:22:43,667
Who are you?

304
00:22:46,152 --> 00:22:50,192
Who are you, to just enter
someone else's property like that?

305
00:22:52,052 --> 00:22:53,525
Are you deaf?

306
00:22:53,637 --> 00:22:55,633
I asked who you are.

307
00:22:57,289 --> 00:23:01,070
Come in.
She's agreed to meet you.

308
00:23:09,376 --> 00:23:11,522
How have you been?

309
00:23:14,787 --> 00:23:19,843
No one inside here
knows of our dealings.

310
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:24,021
And I will remain the
only one here who can help you.

311
00:23:24,258 --> 00:23:28,705
Is there any way for me
to get out of here alive?

312
00:23:29,445 --> 00:23:32,461
Leave that account to me.

313
00:23:33,461 --> 00:23:38,404
Jo Pilyeon will try everything
to get his hands on that.

314
00:23:39,391 --> 00:23:43,552
Where is that account now?

315
00:23:50,142 --> 00:23:51,987
<i>You must tell us.</i>

316
00:23:52,606 --> 00:23:55,278
Who is keeping that account?

317
00:23:56,424 --> 00:23:58,649
Chairman Hwang was taken in as well.

318
00:23:58,872 --> 00:24:00,913
If the KCIA is looking for that,

319
00:24:01,058 --> 00:24:05,036
neither Chairman Hong nor
Chairman Hwang will be safe.

320
00:24:11,482 --> 00:24:13,163
We don't know.

321
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,754
Ma'am.

322
00:24:14,891 --> 00:24:16,011
She said she doesn't know.

323
00:24:16,076 --> 00:24:19,161
What are we supposed to do,
make things up?

324
00:24:22,268 --> 00:24:24,441
Ma'am.

325
00:24:24,572 --> 00:24:29,456
We're only doing this to help you.

326
00:24:30,575 --> 00:24:33,261
When I find the account I will call you,

327
00:24:33,459 --> 00:24:35,298
so please leave.

328
00:24:41,499 --> 00:24:44,188
I have to clean, so get going.

329
00:24:44,269 --> 00:24:45,909
<i>What are you waiting for?</i>

330
00:24:46,015 --> 00:24:48,517
- Hurry up and leave.
- You little... We're having an important...

331
00:24:50,925 --> 00:24:52,756
<i>Leave.</i>

332
00:24:55,138 --> 00:24:58,310
That housemaid looks suspicious.

333
00:24:58,404 --> 00:24:59,968
The housemaid?!

334
00:25:00,055 --> 00:25:04,538
Ehh... What are you saying?
Think he'd entrust that to a housemaid?

335
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:08,237
If put in Chairman Hong's shoes,
I would never give it to my family.

336
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:12,635
That housemaid is the only one
people wouldn't suspect.

337
00:25:12,846 --> 00:25:16,979
Right... Now that I think
about it, makes sense?!

338
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,721
- Take them all in.
- Yes, Sir.

339
00:25:43,674 --> 00:25:44,697
What's wrong with you?

340
00:25:44,842 --> 00:25:47,466
Where are you taking us?

341
00:25:49,821 --> 00:25:52,586
Let me go!
What did we do wrong?

342
00:25:52,665 --> 00:25:54,272
I said let go!

343
00:25:59,682 --> 00:26:01,341
Let's go.

344
00:26:06,515 --> 00:26:10,847
Account or whatever, we're done.

345
00:26:11,044 --> 00:26:14,599
If they even arrested his family,
it's all over, isn't it?

346
00:26:22,384 --> 00:26:26,650
So Director Jo was the one
who arrested my father?

347
00:26:30,554 --> 00:26:34,419
Is your father the one behind all this?

348
00:26:35,296 --> 00:26:36,538
What am I supposed to tell you?

349
00:26:36,696 --> 00:26:38,838
How could he do that to my father?

350
00:26:38,942 --> 00:26:41,134
I think it's a relief, on the contrary?

351
00:26:41,317 --> 00:26:42,818
At least,

352
00:26:43,306 --> 00:26:45,594
I can try to change his mind.

353
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,073
What?

354
00:26:47,784 --> 00:26:51,273
I'm sure there's a reason
why he did all this.

355
00:26:51,602 --> 00:26:53,314
It'll take some time.

356
00:26:53,537 --> 00:26:56,500
Is it because I refused your proposal?

357
00:26:57,303 --> 00:27:01,955
If this is retaliation for that,
isn't it a little crude?

358
00:27:05,944 --> 00:27:11,158
He's not the kind of man who can't
separate business and personal.

359
00:27:12,198 --> 00:27:14,173
Just trust me on this.

360
00:27:14,373 --> 00:27:16,491
I'll take care of this all.

361
00:27:29,788 --> 00:27:33,023
There's nothing...
Nothing at all.

362
00:27:33,787 --> 00:27:35,143
Hey...

363
00:27:35,485 --> 00:27:38,558
The KCIA left empty-handed,
think we would find anything?

364
00:27:38,661 --> 00:27:41,955
Even if it's not the account itself,
there must be some kind of hint.

365
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,937
Search the living room.

366
00:27:46,943 --> 00:27:50,261
I should just steal
everything and run away...

367
00:27:50,445 --> 00:27:53,868
What could possibly be here?

368
00:28:23,843 --> 00:28:27,059
<i>I miss you, my princes.</i>

369
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:30,675
<i>When we meet, what's the
first thing I should do for you?</i>

370
00:28:30,846 --> 00:28:33,006
<i>Should I sing you a song?</i>

371
00:28:33,348 --> 00:28:35,059
<i>Nah...</i>

372
00:28:35,244 --> 00:28:41,353
<i>I think I'll just let you embrace me
as I abandon myself in tears.</i>

373
00:28:58,876 --> 00:29:00,112
<i>Gangmo.</i>

374
00:29:00,284 --> 00:29:01,982
Quick, come.

375
00:29:04,286 --> 00:29:06,155
<i>Hurry up!</i>

376
00:29:22,397 --> 00:29:25,623
They said they're KCIA.

377
00:29:25,884 --> 00:29:29,036
Where has everyone gone?

378
00:29:29,127 --> 00:29:31,938
The KCIA already took them in.

379
00:29:33,352 --> 00:29:34,577
We're too late.

380
00:29:34,695 --> 00:29:38,676
I see there's more than one
KCIA team working on this?

381
00:29:38,768 --> 00:29:41,738
Don't think you should
be here in the first place?

382
00:29:41,928 --> 00:29:45,759
What were you doing in
someone else's empty house?

383
00:29:46,115 --> 00:29:48,248
I see no reason
why I should answer that.

384
00:29:48,353 --> 00:29:51,289
Getting people to
answer questions is my job.

385
00:29:51,885 --> 00:29:54,567
Should I open your mouth our way?

386
00:29:58,202 --> 00:30:00,418
You're here for the account.

387
00:30:02,784 --> 00:30:06,457
So you're going to use that
to save Hwang Taeseop?

388
00:30:07,458 --> 00:30:09,340
A word of warning.

389
00:30:09,564 --> 00:30:12,096
Get out of this while you still can.

390
00:30:12,372 --> 00:30:16,889
Or you'll walk down a path of no return.

391
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:20,022
Who really are you?

392
00:30:22,037 --> 00:30:25,262
Who are you helping and why?

393
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,212
Gangmo...

394
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,956
Are you out of your mind?

395
00:30:33,446 --> 00:30:35,960
This is the last warning.

396
00:30:36,526 --> 00:30:39,041
<i>Don't ever cross paths with me again.</i>

397
00:30:39,291 --> 00:30:41,607
Next time we meet,

398
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:44,372
you will die by my hands.

399
00:30:55,156 --> 00:30:59,751
Hey... Do you know that man?

400
00:31:00,363 --> 00:31:04,142
He's the man who pointed a gun at me.

401
00:31:04,326 --> 00:31:06,577
What... A gun?!

402
00:31:06,775 --> 00:31:10,286
Did he really point a gun at you?

403
00:31:11,102 --> 00:31:15,492
Let's just leave this place.
I'm done with this.

404
00:31:15,603 --> 00:31:17,711
<i>Let's go, hurry up!</i>

405
00:31:17,961 --> 00:31:19,884
<i>I'm leaving.</i>

406
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,386
Write a memo for me.

407
00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:42,191
<i>Where is the account?</i>

408
00:31:42,461 --> 00:31:44,238
I'm just their housemaid.

409
00:31:44,344 --> 00:31:48,042
Would you entrust something
so important to a maid like me?

410
00:31:48,132 --> 00:31:50,752
Where is that account?

411
00:31:59,672 --> 00:32:01,735
What about Hong Gipyo's wife?

412
00:32:01,969 --> 00:32:06,577
She keeps fainting,
so questioning her is hard.

413
00:32:16,834 --> 00:32:18,579
How did it go with Hong Gipyo?

414
00:32:18,719 --> 00:32:21,444
It'll be hard to get anything out of him.

415
00:32:21,799 --> 00:32:23,129
Isn't that all the better?

416
00:32:23,339 --> 00:32:25,275
You never know with torture.

417
00:32:25,364 --> 00:32:29,846
Before he opens his mouth,
we must get our hands on that account.

418
00:32:30,037 --> 00:32:33,109
But I think it would
be wiser to release them.

419
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:34,605
What are you trying to say?

420
00:32:34,724 --> 00:32:36,817
The moment he learns
you have his family in custody,

421
00:32:36,935 --> 00:32:41,501
Hong Gipyo might start
talking to Director Min.

422
00:32:47,112 --> 00:32:49,637
"I know nothing."

423
00:32:58,757 --> 00:33:00,670
Ohh... Seonbaenim.

424
00:33:01,273 --> 00:33:03,446
How is it going?

425
00:33:05,396 --> 00:33:07,801
I'll be transferred back to
the Inspection Department in no time,

426
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,973
<i>so don't give me the cold shoulder.</i>

427
00:33:09,052 --> 00:33:10,474
<i>How could I?</i>

428
00:33:10,579 --> 00:33:12,304
See you around.

429
00:33:53,313 --> 00:33:54,669
<i>Miju.</i>

430
00:33:54,801 --> 00:33:57,987
<i>Tomorrow morning,
someone will come looking for you.</i>

431
00:33:58,151 --> 00:34:00,514
<i>Give him the account.</i>

432
00:34:00,725 --> 00:34:04,056
<i>Only that can help me get out of here.</i>

433
00:34:11,802 --> 00:34:16,586
Ma'am... You can have this.

434
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:23,706
At the auction,
you said you wanted that.

435
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:32,817
Ohh my...

436
00:34:32,936 --> 00:34:34,832
Fits like a glove!

437
00:34:34,977 --> 00:34:37,148
<i>See? What did I tell you?</i>

438
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:39,150
Told you it would look
great on her, didn't I?

439
00:34:39,256 --> 00:34:40,586
<i>Aigoo... Tell me about it!</i>

440
00:34:40,796 --> 00:34:45,462
It looks tailor-made for you!

441
00:34:48,577 --> 00:34:51,675
I don't need any of this,
so take it back.

442
00:34:54,414 --> 00:34:55,678
Ma'am...

443
00:34:55,837 --> 00:34:58,851
Please, release my husband.

444
00:35:00,352 --> 00:35:04,617
If the director puts in a good word,
he'll be released right away.

445
00:35:04,806 --> 00:35:10,194
As if all that overworking wasn't
already taking a toll on his health...

446
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:18,554
I hear your daughter rejected
Minwoo's proposal straight away?

447
00:35:18,844 --> 00:35:20,348
What?

448
00:35:21,204 --> 00:35:23,290
She refused his proposal?!

449
00:35:23,398 --> 00:35:30,420
You know? I raised my son
into a very fine young man.

450
00:35:30,643 --> 00:35:32,724
Even when my husband talked
about tying the knot with you,

451
00:35:32,829 --> 00:35:34,975
deep down I was against it.

452
00:35:35,069 --> 00:35:42,376
But what's so great about you people,
to look down on us?

453
00:35:42,533 --> 00:35:43,934
Ma'am...

454
00:35:44,028 --> 00:35:45,624
Anyhow, this is insulting,

455
00:35:45,785 --> 00:35:48,366
so don't ever call me for this again.

456
00:35:48,498 --> 00:35:51,326
I'm sorry, Ma'am.

457
00:35:51,432 --> 00:35:54,711
We can certainly reconsider
the marriage issue.

458
00:35:55,171 --> 00:35:57,067
Forget it.

459
00:36:01,306 --> 00:36:03,451
Jeongyeon, she will ruin us all.

460
00:36:03,648 --> 00:36:06,426
That rotten little wench...

461
00:36:21,873 --> 00:36:23,493
It's all your fault.

462
00:36:23,745 --> 00:36:26,508
You dare refuse Minwoo's proposal?

463
00:36:27,654 --> 00:36:31,650
It has nothing to do
with Dad being arrested.

464
00:36:31,801 --> 00:36:33,274
Why wouldn't it?

465
00:36:33,434 --> 00:36:35,762
Do you know what
Director Jo's wife told me?

466
00:36:35,916 --> 00:36:37,799
That this mess all happened
because of you.

467
00:36:38,001 --> 00:36:41,064
You'll force death upon
the father of my child!

468
00:37:18,755 --> 00:37:22,405
- And Minwoo?
- He said he'll be working late.

469
00:37:23,512 --> 00:37:25,212
Have some tea.

470
00:37:25,471 --> 00:37:27,036
Thank you.

471
00:37:41,871 --> 00:37:43,280
Hello?

472
00:37:43,438 --> 00:37:45,755
Ohh... Minwoo.

473
00:37:46,321 --> 00:37:47,812
What?!

474
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:51,249
Jeongyeon is meeting Dad?

475
00:38:14,525 --> 00:38:18,884
A drink will be better.
Don't you think?

476
00:38:19,751 --> 00:38:24,163
This is the liquor your father
gave to me as a present.

477
00:38:24,808 --> 00:38:29,561
I promised him I'd save it
for a nice occasion.

478
00:38:30,127 --> 00:38:32,437
<i>The aroma is really nice.</i>

479
00:38:34,188 --> 00:38:36,992
Is it something I can put an end to?

480
00:38:37,743 --> 00:38:41,640
I've heard that my father
could be in danger.

481
00:38:42,416 --> 00:38:44,802
If it's a matter
I can solve on my own,

482
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:47,374
let me know how.

483
00:38:47,782 --> 00:38:49,783
I don't know what they told you, but...

484
00:38:49,902 --> 00:38:54,115
I know that my father refused your offer.

485
00:38:54,912 --> 00:38:59,131
Both funding your elections,
and agreeing to our marriage.

486
00:38:59,586 --> 00:39:05,339
You almost make me sound like
a shameless opportunist.

487
00:39:05,563 --> 00:39:10,013
If what I heard is right, it shouldn't
be too far off from the truth.

488
00:39:10,711 --> 00:39:13,047
Or did I just misunderstand you?

489
00:39:14,858 --> 00:39:18,439
Chairman Hwang made two mistakes.

490
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:24,351
One was sponsoring a corrupt
official just for his own benefit.

491
00:39:24,456 --> 00:39:27,089
- As for that...
- And another...

492
00:39:27,826 --> 00:39:33,028
was not living up to the code
of loyalty we are bound to.

493
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:36,478
Forget any business matter,

494
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:38,782
but when a man betrays your trust,

495
00:39:39,005 --> 00:39:40,577
that's unforgivable.

496
00:39:40,674 --> 00:39:46,185
And whose sake is this "loyalty" for?

497
00:39:46,699 --> 00:39:48,173
I understand.

498
00:39:48,305 --> 00:39:52,426
You're still too young
to understand that concept.

499
00:39:55,375 --> 00:39:57,955
Because you wouldn't possibly know...

500
00:39:59,549 --> 00:40:02,815
that between men,
loyalty is everything.

501
00:40:04,724 --> 00:40:09,727
So what you want to say is that
you won't release my father.

502
00:40:09,858 --> 00:40:11,557
No.

503
00:40:12,057 --> 00:40:16,071
That no self-interest will
interfere with my investigations.

504
00:40:19,257 --> 00:40:22,008
I suggest you go back.

505
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:25,335
The two mistakes my father committed...

506
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,472
No.

507
00:40:28,534 --> 00:40:31,839
The two conditions you gave him.

508
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:35,565
I will fulfill them.

509
00:40:40,015 --> 00:40:46,327
We will support your candidacy
until you're elected as congressman.

510
00:40:47,381 --> 00:40:49,737
And as for the other condition,

511
00:40:52,726 --> 00:40:55,478
would marrying your son suffice?

512
00:40:56,821 --> 00:40:58,457
I will.

513
00:40:58,656 --> 00:41:00,472
What's stopping me?

514
00:41:00,698 --> 00:41:03,197
It's just a strategic marriage, anyway.

515
00:41:04,185 --> 00:41:08,859
But you must release
my father immediately.

516
00:41:09,607 --> 00:41:11,561
You can do that, right?

517
00:41:20,634 --> 00:41:23,917
I planned to leave the personal
out of this investigation,

518
00:41:25,957 --> 00:41:30,927
but you force me to
follow my interests again.

519
00:41:31,309 --> 00:41:36,233
I'll consider this
negotiation over, and leave.

520
00:42:01,419 --> 00:42:04,424
I thought I told you
to trust me on this?

521
00:42:05,132 --> 00:42:09,147
You're no match for
someone like my father.

522
00:42:09,277 --> 00:42:11,836
He's the hardest man to please.

523
00:42:12,204 --> 00:42:14,706
I made the right decision coming here.

524
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:19,617
I finally found out how hard my
father had it with him, all this time.

525
00:42:20,164 --> 00:42:23,935
Feels like I rid myself of that
thick layer which was blinding me.

526
00:42:24,211 --> 00:42:26,979
"So this is what the real world is like!"

527
00:42:27,471 --> 00:42:30,165
Extend my gratitude to your father.

528
00:42:30,876 --> 00:42:32,982
I'll drive you home.

529
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:38,630
So all you wanted from me
was my father's money?

530
00:42:40,302 --> 00:42:42,845
I wanted to trust you.

531
00:42:44,977 --> 00:42:50,441
But whatever you say
from now on, I won't.

532
00:43:13,036 --> 00:43:14,945
What did you say to Jeongyeon?

533
00:43:15,168 --> 00:43:17,552
She stuck to the
strict necessary and left.

534
00:43:17,749 --> 00:43:22,125
Quite a fierce and clever young lady.

535
00:43:22,217 --> 00:43:23,268
Care for a drink?

536
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:26,653
There certainly was a way,
without having to resort to this.

537
00:43:26,763 --> 00:43:30,980
All that matters is the quickest way,
everything else means nothing.

538
00:43:34,561 --> 00:43:37,895
She agreed to marry you.

539
00:43:37,991 --> 00:43:41,752
I know you might not like her yet,
but give it a try.

540
00:43:41,984 --> 00:43:47,879
I think I might soon
fall in love with her?!

541
00:43:48,161 --> 00:43:49,822
Love?!

542
00:43:50,072 --> 00:43:51,883
Can't I?

543
00:43:52,666 --> 00:43:56,260
She mentioned the words
"strategic marriage."

544
00:43:56,351 --> 00:43:59,568
<i>"It's just a strategic marriage,
so what's stopping me?"</i>

545
00:43:59,656 --> 00:44:06,088
Don't let sentiments derail
you away from your objectives.

546
00:44:07,595 --> 00:44:10,064
Thank you, Dad.

547
00:44:10,301 --> 00:44:16,423
For going to such lengths
to make my marriage possible.

548
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:36,031
<i>You're all wet?</i>

549
00:44:36,136 --> 00:44:38,863
You could have called me,
if you had no umbrella.

550
00:44:44,745 --> 00:44:46,703
Come in.

551
00:44:57,811 --> 00:45:00,123
Have you had dinner?

552
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:03,586
If you didn't, should I
make you some ramen noodles?

553
00:45:04,152 --> 00:45:06,996
Think I'll have to get married.

554
00:45:07,641 --> 00:45:11,027
<i>I'm on my way back from
meeting with Minwoo's father.</i>

555
00:45:11,279 --> 00:45:14,156
I gave it a thought while coming back...

556
00:45:14,251 --> 00:45:16,214
There's no reason why I shouldn't.

557
00:45:16,352 --> 00:45:20,519
<i>I wasn't going to get married anyway.</i>

558
00:45:20,876 --> 00:45:24,666
Because it has no meaning to me.

559
00:45:27,246 --> 00:45:29,880
I'll just think of it as a business deal.

560
00:45:30,064 --> 00:45:33,592
Compared to the bribes my father
handed out during his career,

561
00:45:34,013 --> 00:45:36,067
it's nothing much.

562
00:45:36,278 --> 00:45:38,077
Don't do it.

563
00:45:40,131 --> 00:45:43,080
If that's the kind of marriage
you'll get into, just don't!

564
00:45:44,832 --> 00:45:47,728
I'll help the chairman get out.

565
00:45:48,215 --> 00:45:50,875
There's no need to bow down to people
like them, or let them trample on you!

566
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:54,331
You just...
Just have faith in me.

567
00:45:57,815 --> 00:46:02,231
Aren't you tired of that?

568
00:46:06,588 --> 00:46:08,786
All you ever do to me is giving.

569
00:46:08,918 --> 00:46:11,459
You never received anything in return.

570
00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:14,463
All I am to you is a burden.

571
00:46:14,574 --> 00:46:16,633
Haven't you had enough of that?

572
00:46:16,835 --> 00:46:18,134
I sure have.

573
00:46:18,332 --> 00:46:24,068
But marrying Jo Minwoo... No way.

574
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:26,898
Why?

575
00:46:29,545 --> 00:46:31,862
Why would you stop my marriage?

576
00:46:32,041 --> 00:46:34,021
Because I...

577
00:46:42,282 --> 00:46:44,520
don't want you to marry.

578
00:48:24,148 --> 00:48:27,913
You have that account, right?

579
00:48:28,466 --> 00:48:30,686
You have it, right?

580
00:48:35,253 --> 00:48:37,557
Wait a moment.

581
00:48:44,746 --> 00:48:47,418
You're giving him the account?

582
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:49,013
Read this.

583
00:48:49,144 --> 00:48:51,578
It's the chairman's handwriting, see?

584
00:48:54,358 --> 00:48:57,189
Since he'll be released
if we give them the account,

585
00:48:57,333 --> 00:48:59,703
you don't need to worry.

586
00:49:06,154 --> 00:49:08,339
Honey...

587
00:49:26,362 --> 00:49:27,958
Follow me.

588
00:49:35,883 --> 00:49:39,196
Welcome.
How can I help you?

589
00:50:33,683 --> 00:50:37,106
Where did your housemaid go?

590
00:50:38,659 --> 00:50:41,978
She left for the market this morning.

591
00:50:42,202 --> 00:50:44,557
Is anything the matter?

592
00:50:44,795 --> 00:50:47,517
Have you read the memo we left you?

593
00:50:47,728 --> 00:50:49,134
Memo?

594
00:50:49,348 --> 00:50:52,192
You must have received
a memo from Chairman Hong.

595
00:50:52,494 --> 00:50:58,458
That... She already went
with someone else to take it?

596
00:51:00,447 --> 00:51:04,134
So you gave it to someone
other than our people?

597
00:51:07,018 --> 00:51:09,480
Just as it says here...

598
00:51:11,823 --> 00:51:13,277
Where were they headed?

599
00:51:13,390 --> 00:51:15,523
I don't really know.

600
00:51:15,952 --> 00:51:18,296
Do you know who that man was?

601
00:51:37,178 --> 00:51:39,675
<i>{\a6}~ National Development Fund ~</i>

602
00:51:37,178 --> 00:51:39,675
<i>Min Honggi
~ Committee Members ~</i>

603
00:51:39,785 --> 00:51:43,276
It was the chairman
who wrote that memo, right?

604
00:51:44,274 --> 00:51:45,674
When are you releasing him?

605
00:51:45,766 --> 00:51:48,136
Can he come out today?

606
00:51:51,401 --> 00:51:52,941
What's wrong?

607
00:51:53,073 --> 00:51:56,536
Must we wait longer?

608
00:51:58,196 --> 00:52:00,553
I'll drive you home.

609
00:52:09,022 --> 00:52:10,454
Seonbaenim.

610
00:52:35,581 --> 00:52:37,477
Follow that car.

611
00:52:53,793 --> 00:52:55,781
Pull aside!

612
00:53:11,966 --> 00:53:13,894
Stop the car!

613
00:54:18,366 --> 00:54:19,788
Stop!

614
00:54:58,089 --> 00:55:00,123
I warned you, didn't I?

615
00:55:00,556 --> 00:55:01,940
That the next time we meet,

616
00:55:02,124 --> 00:55:04,744
you'd die by my hands.

617
00:55:13,628 --> 00:55:15,063
You can't commit murder!

618
00:55:15,173 --> 00:55:16,866
He'll only cause us more
trouble if we let him go.

619
00:55:17,011 --> 00:55:19,855
- Still, murder...
- Let go.

620
00:55:21,132 --> 00:55:24,108
- Seonbaenim... Seonbaenim!
- Out of the way!

621
00:55:27,337 --> 00:55:30,654
My brother was killed unfairly as well!

622
00:55:30,931 --> 00:55:34,617
I beg you, Seonbaenim... Please.

623
00:56:09,789 --> 00:56:14,238
This is a copy of the account.

624
00:56:17,602 --> 00:56:19,860
I'll keep the original.

625
00:56:20,215 --> 00:56:25,150
Hide it somewhere safe, and give it
back to Chairman Hong when he's out.

626
00:56:27,201 --> 00:56:30,653
Then, that man from earlier on...

627
00:56:33,694 --> 00:56:37,077
What happened to him?

628
00:56:38,410 --> 00:56:41,859
The man I gave the account to.

629
00:57:04,681 --> 00:57:06,481
Give it to me!

630
00:57:07,666 --> 00:57:09,191
You finally found it!

631
00:57:09,284 --> 00:57:11,445
You found the account!!

632
00:57:12,329 --> 00:57:14,947
You must never reveal I was
the one who brought you this.

633
00:57:15,039 --> 00:57:16,665
Don't you worry.

634
00:57:16,935 --> 00:57:18,723
Well done!

635
00:57:21,454 --> 00:57:23,802
It's all over now.

636
00:57:33,624 --> 00:57:37,114
Aigoo... How can it be so dirty...

637
00:57:37,256 --> 00:57:40,017
You little, look at you...

638
00:57:40,221 --> 00:57:42,250
Make it shine.

639
00:57:42,632 --> 00:57:45,462
<i>Do you know how much they're worth?</i>

640
00:57:45,852 --> 00:57:49,978
But where's Gangmo gone all day?

641
00:57:50,189 --> 00:57:51,998
Don't ask me...

642
00:57:52,074 --> 00:57:53,729
"Don't ask me"?

643
00:57:53,821 --> 00:57:55,836
That won't do it!

644
00:57:55,949 --> 00:58:00,892
As long as I'm here,
you better get with the program!

645
00:58:03,222 --> 00:58:05,079
Jeongyeon, what brings you here?

646
00:58:05,263 --> 00:58:06,649
Where's Gangmo?

647
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:08,209
<i>I don't know.</i>

648
00:58:09,249 --> 00:58:10,237
Now that I think about it,

649
00:58:10,395 --> 00:58:12,980
I haven't been able to reach him all day?!

650
00:58:17,873 --> 00:58:19,479
Yes?

651
00:58:23,062 --> 00:58:24,734
<i>Shideok...</i>

652
00:58:25,056 --> 00:58:26,354
Gangmo!

653
00:58:26,510 --> 00:58:28,816
What's wrong with your voice?

~ On The Next Episode Of ~

660
00:58:47,552 --> 00:58:48,727
Just stop the investigation.

661
00:58:48,859 --> 00:58:52,152
What were you doing while
Min Honggi got hold of the account?

662
00:58:52,283 --> 00:58:54,757
<i>I'm sure there must be
a copy of that account.</i>

663
00:58:54,854 --> 00:58:55,935
Look, Chairman Hong.

664
00:58:56,005 --> 00:58:59,011
If you're just pretending...
You have the account, right?

665
00:58:59,116 --> 00:59:02,474
So what, did you
follow me all the way here?

666
00:59:02,803 --> 00:59:04,370
O...ppa?
