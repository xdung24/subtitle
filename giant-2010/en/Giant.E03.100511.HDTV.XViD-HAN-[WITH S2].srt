5
00:00:35,467 --> 00:00:36,660
<i>Close this one.</i>

6
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,049
Yes.

7
00:00:51,984 --> 00:00:54,216
Where are the Korean Army
support quarters?

8
00:00:54,325 --> 00:00:58,642
Yes... Go straight
until the very last building.

9
00:01:14,511 --> 00:01:16,857
<i>You're sure she's dead?</i>

10
00:01:17,476 --> 00:01:19,769
I saw her body firsthand.

11
00:01:20,085 --> 00:01:22,544
And the kids ran away?

12
00:01:22,873 --> 00:01:25,741
They're still children
who know nothing of the world.

13
00:01:25,839 --> 00:01:28,113
I don't think you need to worry.

14
00:01:28,737 --> 00:01:30,971
Briquette gas...

15
00:01:31,097 --> 00:01:37,855
That's that, but stealing that secret
document will be no laughing matter.

16
00:01:37,993 --> 00:01:40,033
Of course it won't be.

17
00:01:40,176 --> 00:01:44,090
<i>We don't even know
where they keep it, do we?</i>

18
00:01:48,183 --> 00:01:49,393
Loyalty.

19
00:01:49,516 --> 00:01:51,993
General Hampton
just arrived at his office.

20
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:54,530
Tell him we will be there soon.

21
00:01:54,661 --> 00:01:57,036
<i>Yes. Loyalty!</i>

22
00:01:58,192 --> 00:02:02,857
Do you at least have any plan on
how to get our hands on that document?

23
00:02:13,981 --> 00:02:16,288
- This should be enough, right?
- Yes.

24
00:02:16,598 --> 00:02:19,019
You know how to
make those boots shine?

25
00:02:19,312 --> 00:02:21,233
I don't want to see
a blemish on them, got it?

26
00:02:21,376 --> 00:02:21,951
All right.

27
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:24,141
I'll count on you, then.

28
00:02:43,805 --> 00:02:45,838
I won't steal it.

29
00:02:49,453 --> 00:02:51,203
What's with the boots?

30
00:02:51,316 --> 00:02:53,066
They're General Hampton's.

31
00:02:53,234 --> 00:02:55,747
And why isn't his orderly
taking care of them?

32
00:02:55,854 --> 00:02:57,542
Ahh... He went out.

33
00:02:57,662 --> 00:02:58,595
What?

34
00:02:58,834 --> 00:03:01,706
Ehh... Lazy bum...

35
00:03:03,242 --> 00:03:08,048
By the way, Seoul's tallest building
is the 31 Building, right?

36
00:03:08,377 --> 00:03:10,453
Yeah. Why?

37
00:03:11,446 --> 00:03:13,101
Never mind.

38
00:03:16,245 --> 00:03:18,998
<i>They said it's 31 Building.</i>

39
00:03:19,123 --> 00:03:20,871
31 Building?

40
00:03:20,984 --> 00:03:25,508
Yeah... The tallest building
in Seoul is 31 storeys high.

41
00:03:25,628 --> 00:03:27,392
That's why it's called that way.

42
00:03:27,572 --> 00:03:32,291
Then, if we go there,
we can meet Big Oppa?

43
00:03:34,755 --> 00:03:36,504
<i>What could have happened to him?</i>

44
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:39,034
When you have a death wish,
anything is possible.

45
00:03:39,311 --> 00:03:41,418
Crazy fool...

46
00:03:41,744 --> 00:03:44,524
Jumping off a moving train...

47
00:03:47,235 --> 00:03:50,375
We can meet Big Oppa there, can't we?

48
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:51,966
Yeah.

49
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:53,401
We can.

50
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:55,272
Don't worry.

51
00:03:56,059 --> 00:04:01,277
Aigoo...
The baby is eating like a champ?!

52
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,564
How long have you been
starving the poor little thing?

53
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:07,723
Are you orphans?

54
00:04:08,501 --> 00:04:10,799
You have somewhere to go, don't you?

55
00:04:11,014 --> 00:04:13,013
We have a house in Seoul.

56
00:04:13,168 --> 00:04:16,228
And where's our house?

57
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:24,050
Here...

58
00:04:24,149 --> 00:04:26,149
Take a look.

59
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:29,611
<i>This is the land Dad bought in Seoul.</i>

60
00:04:29,899 --> 00:04:33,273
When we meet Hyung,
all we need is to go live there.

61
00:04:33,955 --> 00:04:37,486
I miss Mommy and Daddy...

62
00:04:47,254 --> 00:04:49,531
Ajeosshi.

63
00:04:50,265 --> 00:04:51,631
What?

64
00:04:52,132 --> 00:04:54,406
You're going to Seoul, right?

65
00:04:54,813 --> 00:04:56,581
My mother told us to ride this truck.

66
00:04:56,736 --> 00:04:58,292
And your mother?

67
00:04:58,719 --> 00:05:01,786
- My mother is coming la...
- Our mother is gone.

68
00:05:02,021 --> 00:05:05,520
Gone? She's dead?

69
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,207
Yes.

70
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:11,672
Let's see the money first.

71
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:14,520
How much is it?

72
00:05:19,243 --> 00:05:24,018
I'm Major Jo Pilyeon,
appointed to the Korean Army support.

73
00:05:25,896 --> 00:05:28,388
I welcome you, Major Jo.

74
00:05:30,447 --> 00:05:33,782
I've heard you like orchids.

75
00:05:34,002 --> 00:05:35,834
<i>Please, accept it.</i>

76
00:05:37,528 --> 00:05:39,306
Thank you.

77
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,193
Have a seat.

78
00:06:05,179 --> 00:06:08,398
Where is General Hampton's office?

79
00:06:08,565 --> 00:06:11,282
Take the stairs all the way up.
It's on the second floor.

80
00:06:18,324 --> 00:06:21,884
I hear you were in Vietnam,
before they sent you here.

81
00:06:22,068 --> 00:06:25,295
I was working with
Korean forces there, too.

82
00:06:25,391 --> 00:06:27,820
So that explains your excellent Korean.

83
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:30,653
As long as I'm in charge of
the Korean support unit,

84
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:33,508
we will spare no effort
to assist the Eighth Army.

85
00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:35,447
I appreciate that.

86
00:06:35,746 --> 00:06:37,146
So...

87
00:06:38,238 --> 00:06:40,844
I've heard that you worked
for the Security Command,

88
00:06:40,963 --> 00:06:43,103
before your recent assignment here.

89
00:06:47,034 --> 00:06:48,315
Yes...

90
00:06:48,619 --> 00:06:50,447
Down in Busan.

91
00:06:51,525 --> 00:06:53,491
That's strange... I...

92
00:06:53,694 --> 00:06:58,446
I don't recall seeing your name on the
recent defense department promotion list.

93
00:07:00,301 --> 00:07:05,475
I'm surprised you looked into
low-ranked personnel like me.

94
00:07:05,619 --> 00:07:08,826
I wanted to get to know
who you are before your...

95
00:07:09,087 --> 00:07:10,491
Your recent assignment here.

96
00:07:10,604 --> 00:07:12,955
I was just lucky.

97
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:17,119
Well... Congratulations on
your recent promotion, anyhow.

98
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:19,058
Thank you.

99
00:07:32,345 --> 00:07:33,504
What is it?

100
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:35,542
I brought the General's boots.

101
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,507
Leave them over there.

102
00:08:13,555 --> 00:08:15,355
<i>~ Jo Pilyeon ~</i>

103
00:08:17,226 --> 00:08:18,941
<i>~ Jo Pilyeon ~</i>

104
00:08:44,364 --> 00:08:45,311
He's no pushover.

105
00:08:45,407 --> 00:08:47,921
But he won't figure out our plans.

106
00:08:48,067 --> 00:08:50,816
We're facing the man leading the
Eighth Army's Intelligence Brigade.

107
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,633
If we don't finish this quickly and
with the utmost accuracy, we're screwed.

108
00:08:53,789 --> 00:08:54,541
Understood?

109
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:56,302
Yes, Sir.

110
00:09:19,633 --> 00:09:21,195
You're back?

111
00:09:22,984 --> 00:09:23,869
Hyung.

112
00:09:24,001 --> 00:09:27,376
At the laundry down here, do you work
on the Korean troops' uniforms as well?

113
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:29,026
Yeah... But why?

114
00:09:29,134 --> 00:09:30,966
Allow me to work at the laundry, then.

115
00:09:31,097 --> 00:09:34,538
Be it dry cleaning, ironing,
or cleaning, I can do anything.

116
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:38,625
I'll look if there's any opening.

117
00:09:55,617 --> 00:10:00,592
Ehh... It's so damn noisy
I can't even drive.

118
00:10:01,981 --> 00:10:05,058
What's wrong with the baby?

119
00:10:05,724 --> 00:10:08,155
Oppa, the baby's burning.

120
00:10:08,251 --> 00:10:09,711
What?

121
00:10:12,309 --> 00:10:13,432
Ajeosshi.

122
00:10:13,544 --> 00:10:15,085
Is there any pharmacy nearby?

123
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:16,819
Give me a break...

124
00:10:16,911 --> 00:10:19,788
I'm busy as hell,
what damned pharmacy?!

125
00:10:24,403 --> 00:10:27,513
<i>{\a6}*name comes from old Joseon
horse post, current Yangjae-Dong</i>

126
00:10:24,403 --> 00:10:27,513
We'll reach Maljukgeori* in a while.

127
00:10:27,645 --> 00:10:30,033
You should find one there.

128
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,381
<i>~ Civil officials preying on our
fellow citizens, enough is enough! ~</i>

129
00:10:45,501 --> 00:10:47,719
<i>~ Invalidate Contracts!
Against the redevelopment! ~</i>

130
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:53,068
<i>~ Bought over for a sack of rice.
Down with the Yankee thugs! ~</i>

131
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,061
Ajeosshi.

132
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:59,666
Let's hurry up and find a pharmacy.

133
00:11:10,653 --> 00:11:11,928
Aren't you going with him?

134
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:12,989
Why should I?

135
00:11:13,121 --> 00:11:14,695
You said you were headed for Gangnam.

136
00:11:14,798 --> 00:11:16,891
We're in Gangnam.

137
00:11:18,234 --> 00:11:21,001
I'll step out when Oppa comes back.

138
00:11:26,889 --> 00:11:28,887
Come here...

139
00:11:30,713 --> 00:11:32,662
<i>Ajeosshi... My bag!</i>

140
00:11:33,785 --> 00:11:35,364
Ajeosshi... The bag!

141
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,764
Give me the bag!

142
00:11:36,848 --> 00:11:39,230
- Ajeosshi.
- Ajeosshi is busy.

143
00:11:39,349 --> 00:11:40,990
I'll get going.

144
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:43,346
Ajeosshi, give me my bag.

145
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:45,524
<i>Ajeosshi!</i>

146
00:11:46,685 --> 00:11:50,419
Oppa... Oppa!
That Ajeosshi took our bag and left!

147
00:11:50,514 --> 00:11:51,855
What?

148
00:11:56,941 --> 00:11:59,681
The bag!
Ajeosshi, the bag!

149
00:12:05,469 --> 00:12:06,874
Ajeosshi...

150
00:12:15,628 --> 00:12:17,494
Ahh... Scared me to death...

151
00:12:17,609 --> 00:12:19,182
<i>What are you doing?</i>

152
00:12:19,449 --> 00:12:22,364
Follow that truck, please.

153
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,735
Let's just go, Honey.

154
00:12:24,938 --> 00:12:27,967
You crazy little runt...

155
00:12:39,105 --> 00:12:40,927
My bag...

156
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:50,149
<i>Leave!</i>

157
00:12:53,437 --> 00:12:55,732
What is going on?

158
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:56,752
Jeongshik.

159
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,690
Jeongshik... What is this?

160
00:12:58,762 --> 00:13:00,383
- Mom...
- Look at this blood!

161
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:01,610
You!

162
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,723
He insulted my mother.

163
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,931
You little brat...

164
00:13:08,516 --> 00:13:09,817
Why did you slap me?

165
00:13:09,936 --> 00:13:11,472
Who are you to slap me?

166
00:13:11,564 --> 00:13:13,494
Takes after her mother, all right.

167
00:13:13,614 --> 00:13:16,574
You steal someone else's money and run away,
but still have the guts to make a scene?

168
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:17,851
Don't insult my mother.

169
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:19,137
How could I not?

170
00:13:19,241 --> 00:13:21,238
And who could a thieving
little brat like you take after?

171
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:24,514
Does a bar slut's blood
just vanish into thin air?

172
00:13:24,702 --> 00:13:27,317
Don't insult my mother...
Don't even think about it!

173
00:13:27,425 --> 00:13:31,149
Aigoo... And she has the balls
to call scumbags like her, "mother."

174
00:13:31,425 --> 00:13:33,088
Listen well, uh?

175
00:13:33,231 --> 00:13:35,591
- Your mother!
- You're schizophrenic.

176
00:13:35,702 --> 00:13:36,512
What?

177
00:13:36,603 --> 00:13:38,444
If my mother's a scumbag,

178
00:13:38,552 --> 00:13:40,842
then you're schizophrenic.

179
00:13:40,998 --> 00:13:44,187
You act all kind and accommodating
when Dad's around...

180
00:13:44,327 --> 00:13:46,402
You make me sick.

181
00:13:46,845 --> 00:13:48,472
You brat...

182
00:13:49,154 --> 00:13:52,589
Honey! Honey...

183
00:13:53,038 --> 00:13:56,454
Jeongyeon that brat wasn't content
with hitting him in the head,

184
00:13:56,558 --> 00:13:58,929
but do you know what she called me?

185
00:13:59,022 --> 00:14:00,780
Let me look.

186
00:14:01,444 --> 00:14:03,896
Take him to the hospital.

187
00:14:04,089 --> 00:14:07,745
I can't live with her any longer,
just so you know.

188
00:14:07,912 --> 00:14:08,858
Jeongshik, let's go.

189
00:14:09,013 --> 00:14:11,687
Aww... My boy... What now?

190
00:14:16,794 --> 00:14:19,562
- You little...
- Let me meet my mother.

191
00:14:22,551 --> 00:14:25,961
You can't meet her again.

192
00:14:26,168 --> 00:14:26,952
Why not?

193
00:14:27,057 --> 00:14:29,677
You said you'd let me meet her,
after I'd recover.

194
00:14:29,789 --> 00:14:32,522
And what do you plan to
accomplish by meeting her?

195
00:14:32,768 --> 00:14:34,262
You won't meet again.

196
00:14:34,425 --> 00:14:35,837
So...

197
00:14:39,108 --> 00:14:41,130
Just pretend she's dead.

198
00:14:44,589 --> 00:14:50,321
What kind of person was she?

199
00:14:53,086 --> 00:14:56,485
What kind of person could she be,
for you to abandon her like that?

200
00:14:58,581 --> 00:15:00,254
Your mother...

201
00:15:00,961 --> 00:15:02,779
was a really kind...

202
00:15:03,033 --> 00:15:04,989
and beautiful woman.

203
00:15:08,624 --> 00:15:13,893
She was smart as well,
so she was a good student.

204
00:15:15,191 --> 00:15:16,669
So...

205
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,083
Why did you abandon her?

206
00:15:20,943 --> 00:15:25,133
She was the first to abandon me!
Because I was poor and ignorant.

207
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:32,942
So, now that you know,
stop looking for her.

208
00:15:37,573 --> 00:15:39,828
Liar...

209
00:16:52,205 --> 00:16:54,969
Anyone in?

210
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,915
Hey... Miju!

211
00:17:00,403 --> 00:17:02,687
We have no place to sleep,

212
00:17:02,801 --> 00:17:05,029
is anyone in?

213
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,872
Looks like they're all asleep.

214
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:27,021
It's not as cold as I thought?

215
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:29,976
Let's sleep here just for tonight.

216
00:17:30,105 --> 00:17:32,149
Oppa, what now?

217
00:17:32,254 --> 00:17:35,299
The baby must be hungry.

218
00:17:39,595 --> 00:17:40,780
No milk left, I bet.

219
00:17:40,899 --> 00:17:43,342
Yeah... We ran out.

220
00:17:51,687 --> 00:17:53,877
Is that a pear?

221
00:17:57,851 --> 00:18:01,345
Oppa! That's stealing!

222
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,966
<i>Ohh... Look!</i>

223
00:18:11,137 --> 00:18:13,264
Must be tasty.

224
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:19,426
Have one.

225
00:18:20,729 --> 00:18:21,952
I'm fine, Oppa.

226
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,064
It's all right.

227
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,641
I'll make a ton of money
and pay them back later.

228
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:27,107
Go ahead and eat.

229
00:18:27,223 --> 00:18:29,356
Then, you eat, too.

230
00:18:29,447 --> 00:18:31,057
All right.

231
00:18:40,947 --> 00:18:45,547
But where's our house?

232
00:18:49,042 --> 00:18:51,982
We have no house anymore.

233
00:18:52,126 --> 00:18:53,162
Why?

234
00:18:53,286 --> 00:18:56,811
We lost the bag, you silly.
Everything we had was inside that.

235
00:18:56,924 --> 00:19:01,053
Then, what happens to us now?

236
00:19:01,499 --> 00:19:02,657
It's okay.

237
00:19:02,824 --> 00:19:05,892
When we meet Hyung,
we'll be able to find everything.

238
00:19:06,016 --> 00:19:07,796
Don't worry.

239
00:19:44,786 --> 00:19:47,324
Go ahead and eat.

240
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:49,035
Here... Have some of this as well.

241
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,806
Here you go.

242
00:19:50,926 --> 00:19:52,434
Honey, any soup left?

243
00:19:52,517 --> 00:19:54,600
What are you,
counting the grains of rice?

244
00:19:54,719 --> 00:19:56,825
<i>Eat and go back to your room!</i>

245
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:59,394
Why are you taking it out on us?

246
00:20:00,634 --> 00:20:04,640
You'll leave when
you're done eating, right?

247
00:20:04,764 --> 00:20:05,833
What?

248
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:07,065
Yes.

249
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:09,614
Didn't they say
they have nowhere to go?

250
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:12,447
- In this cold...
- Is this a damned orphanage?

251
00:20:12,591 --> 00:20:14,098
<i>Go take a look outside.</i>

252
00:20:14,242 --> 00:20:16,526
The streets are filled with beggars!

253
00:20:18,107 --> 00:20:20,322
We'll leave right away.

254
00:20:20,444 --> 00:20:22,191
Hurry up and eat.

255
00:20:22,392 --> 00:20:24,723
<i>Aigoo...
They'll get indigestion.</i>

256
00:20:24,879 --> 00:20:27,619
Eat slowly.

257
00:20:28,624 --> 00:20:31,197
And what is this smell?

258
00:20:32,956 --> 00:20:35,122
Must have pooped!

259
00:20:35,242 --> 00:20:37,651
- Uh?
- The smell...

260
00:20:37,795 --> 00:20:39,231
How can one eat with this smell?

261
00:20:39,362 --> 00:20:42,510
Didn't you bring any diapers?

262
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,520
I'm sorry, Ajumma.

263
00:20:44,664 --> 00:20:46,471
I'll take care of it.

264
00:20:46,866 --> 00:20:49,008
<i>It stinks...</i>

265
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:54,872
- Do your homework right away.
- I did it all already.

266
00:20:56,777 --> 00:21:00,114
Load them right.

267
00:21:01,012 --> 00:21:03,297
You'll get hurt that way.
Take it easy.

268
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:05,241
It's all right.
I must earn my keep, at least.

269
00:21:05,396 --> 00:21:07,766
<i>Aigoo, you little...</i>

270
00:21:15,377 --> 00:21:17,459
What are you doing there?

271
00:21:17,615 --> 00:21:20,122
I'm almost done, Ajumma.

272
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:24,419
The other bowls on the shelf were dusty,
so I took care of those as well.

273
00:21:25,394 --> 00:21:26,745
Why are you boiling that water?

274
00:21:26,851 --> 00:21:27,829
So I can do the laundry.

275
00:21:27,913 --> 00:21:31,505
Because of the baby,
the covers got dirty.

276
00:21:32,399 --> 00:21:36,280
Seems like you think that
by doing this we'll let you stay,

277
00:21:36,412 --> 00:21:39,434
but it's no use.
Are we clear?

278
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,333
But what's with these leftovers?

279
00:21:46,453 --> 00:21:49,768
So you can take
them along when you leave?

280
00:21:50,641 --> 00:21:53,298
I'm sorry, Ajumma.

281
00:22:08,985 --> 00:22:10,742
<i>~ Jo Pilyeon ~</i>

282
00:22:55,662 --> 00:22:56,830
Sir.

283
00:22:57,368 --> 00:22:59,666
More intel from Vietnam.

284
00:23:01,928 --> 00:23:05,160
Recent CIA activity
has been a bit... strange.

285
00:23:05,244 --> 00:23:06,213
What do you mean?

286
00:23:06,334 --> 00:23:08,953
Think they've noticed that we're
working on a secret document.

287
00:23:09,073 --> 00:23:11,921
We'll be done with the
document pretty soon.

288
00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:15,966
Just pay special attention to
maintain a tight sense of security.

289
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:17,653
Roger, Sir.

290
00:23:56,524 --> 00:24:00,157
There is no doubt now that General Hampton
is holding this secret document.

291
00:24:00,289 --> 00:24:01,976
Problem is the location.

292
00:24:02,081 --> 00:24:05,698
We must find out where he's keeping it.

293
00:24:05,965 --> 00:24:08,175
We will find out soon.

294
00:24:08,925 --> 00:24:10,628
I really don't get it.

295
00:24:10,804 --> 00:24:12,683
What's so special about that document,

296
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:16,608
sending our government into a frenzy
to get their hands on it?

297
00:24:25,209 --> 00:24:26,919
<i>A bug?!</i>

298
00:24:27,451 --> 00:24:31,450
Hampton, Hamburger or whatever...
You wiretapped that fella's office?

299
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:33,058
Yes.

300
00:24:35,281 --> 00:24:37,139
Wouldn't that be dangerous?

301
00:24:37,294 --> 00:24:39,115
What if they find out?

302
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:42,258
They will never be able to find it,

303
00:24:42,364 --> 00:24:44,273
so you needn't worry.

304
00:24:44,518 --> 00:24:46,451
Anyhow, there's no time to waste.

305
00:24:46,583 --> 00:24:48,731
Find out where they keep that document.

306
00:24:48,843 --> 00:24:52,362
But I'd like to ask you something.

307
00:24:52,881 --> 00:24:58,238
What do you plan to do with that
secret document regarding Vietnam?

308
00:24:58,382 --> 00:25:01,054
Ohh... You don't need to know.

309
00:25:01,211 --> 00:25:07,586
I know that a few of your colleagues' heads
depend on this mission of mine.

310
00:25:07,781 --> 00:25:09,789
What's with all this curiosity?

311
00:25:09,899 --> 00:25:12,193
All you need to do
is complete your task.

312
00:25:12,325 --> 00:25:13,809
By any chance,

313
00:25:14,455 --> 00:25:17,277
does it have anything to do with
your development plans in South Seoul?

314
00:25:18,165 --> 00:25:22,477
To my knowledge, you've bought land
in Gangnam under a namesake,

315
00:25:22,585 --> 00:25:25,137
without informing the president...

316
00:25:25,235 --> 00:25:27,513
Listen to you!

317
00:25:27,665 --> 00:25:31,524
That's what I don't like about you!
Never minding your own business.

318
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:34,315
Seems like my guess was right.

319
00:25:35,128 --> 00:25:36,600
May I see those development plans?

320
00:25:36,696 --> 00:25:37,832
Look, Jo Pilyeon!

321
00:25:37,928 --> 00:25:40,645
I'm staking my life on this task.

322
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:44,007
I have no intention of
being moved around like a pawn,

323
00:25:44,115 --> 00:25:49,228
without even knowing what benefits this
will bring to our country and the president.

324
00:25:52,924 --> 00:25:55,343
If you insist on treating me
like an outsider,

325
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:57,463
then we can part ways right now.

326
00:25:57,587 --> 00:26:00,125
You can do the dirty work yourselves.

327
00:26:00,293 --> 00:26:03,156
- What are you doing?
- We'll show it to you.

328
00:26:08,211 --> 00:26:11,543
But before that,
let's make one thing perfectly clear.

329
00:26:12,203 --> 00:26:17,267
If you use these plans
for your personal gains,

330
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:20,307
you're making a mistake
you will dearly pay for.

331
00:26:20,472 --> 00:26:23,869
If those were my intentions, I'd have
focused on real estate from the start.

332
00:26:24,036 --> 00:26:27,494
Why would I ever risk
so much doing this, then?

333
00:26:34,608 --> 00:26:40,071
Here's our development plans
for South Seoul.

334
00:26:44,063 --> 00:26:45,552
<i>~ South Seoul Land Development Plan ~</i>

335
00:26:52,918 --> 00:26:55,991
If my behavior insulted you,
accept my apologies.

336
00:26:56,294 --> 00:27:02,692
I merely was wishing for you to
think of me as a brother in arms.

337
00:27:04,353 --> 00:27:08,890
Should you fail...

338
00:27:10,078 --> 00:27:13,342
You'll be the first
to pay with your life.

339
00:27:15,624 --> 00:27:18,061
You really seem to have
riled up Congressman Oh.

340
00:27:18,182 --> 00:27:19,398
As he wishes.

341
00:27:19,529 --> 00:27:22,713
We'll continue needing his support,
so shouldn't we avoid enraging him?

342
00:27:22,856 --> 00:27:26,783
Always do as they tell you, and you'll
only amount to a puppet they control.

343
00:27:28,253 --> 00:27:32,354
There soon will be a
revolution in Gangnam.

344
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:36,707
An epochal change we
couldn't possibly fathom.

345
00:27:37,513 --> 00:27:42,693
Those quick on their feet will
see Gangnam turn into a goldmine,

346
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:47,082
while the rest will only
be left with useless gravel.

347
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:49,155
I told you, didn't I?

348
00:27:49,261 --> 00:27:52,069
If you want to gain power,
you need money.

349
00:27:52,881 --> 00:27:55,483
It's a dog-eat-dog world
we're dealing with,

350
00:27:55,638 --> 00:27:58,425
so nothing says we shouldn't
fight to survive as well.

351
00:27:59,167 --> 00:28:01,632
I'll go see Director Hwang, so call him.

352
00:28:01,772 --> 00:28:03,149
Yes.

353
00:28:09,416 --> 00:28:10,978
<i>Dead?!</i>

354
00:28:11,863 --> 00:28:14,097
Are you telling me
their mother is dead?

355
00:28:14,847 --> 00:28:19,325
I went to the district ward,
and saw the certificate of death.

356
00:28:20,151 --> 00:28:21,604
And the kids?

357
00:28:21,729 --> 00:28:25,206
I asked around, but couldn't find them.

358
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:28,355
Even if you have to ransack
every orphanage in Busan,

359
00:28:28,495 --> 00:28:30,539
we must find them.

360
00:28:30,663 --> 00:28:34,724
I already set some
of my men in motion.

361
00:28:35,322 --> 00:28:37,094
Jo Pilyeon...

362
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:39,389
That wretched scumbag...

363
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:42,417
What on earth is he
trying to accomplish?

364
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:49,669
Yes?

365
00:28:51,764 --> 00:28:53,888
Yes, that'd be me.

366
00:28:56,611 --> 00:28:58,327
Sure.

367
00:29:04,706 --> 00:29:07,388
It's the development plan for South Seoul.

368
00:29:07,511 --> 00:29:12,437
They're soon going to erect a huge
integrated government building in Gangnam.

369
00:29:13,143 --> 00:29:15,285
Paddy fields or forest land,
it makes no difference,

370
00:29:15,417 --> 00:29:18,120
<i>{\a6}*right at the center of Gangnam District</i>

371
00:29:15,417 --> 00:29:18,120
so buy all the land
you can in Samseong-Dong*.

372
00:29:18,245 --> 00:29:22,276
<i>It's only a matter of time
before that land turns into gold.</i>

373
00:29:23,973 --> 00:29:29,660
I just gave you precious information,
but you don't look too pleased?!

374
00:29:31,462 --> 00:29:34,590
I just found out my friend's wife died.

375
00:29:36,517 --> 00:29:40,430
That man who drove the truck.

376
00:29:42,811 --> 00:29:45,099
I must find out what happened.

377
00:29:46,642 --> 00:29:51,190
I trust you're not responsible, again?

378
00:29:51,357 --> 00:29:53,428
Regrettably,

379
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:56,348
it wasn't me.

380
00:29:58,333 --> 00:30:00,549
Did you say it was a
briquette gas accident?

381
00:30:01,596 --> 00:30:03,044
Yes.

382
00:30:05,934 --> 00:30:07,436
<i>Happy now?</i>

383
00:30:07,771 --> 00:30:12,143
You're not telling me you're looking
for your late friend's family?

384
00:30:13,808 --> 00:30:15,481
Seems like I was mistaken about you.

385
00:30:15,661 --> 00:30:17,475
Why did you become so weak?

386
00:30:17,586 --> 00:30:21,297
We're a mortal enemy to them,
both you and I!

387
00:30:22,913 --> 00:30:24,768
Keep acting this way,

388
00:30:24,911 --> 00:30:27,067
and I'll make sure
I find them before you do.

389
00:30:27,223 --> 00:30:28,850
Is that clear?

390
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,141
Forget them.

391
00:30:33,266 --> 00:30:38,580
Erase all those squalid
memories blinding you,

392
00:30:39,118 --> 00:30:43,620
and start worrying about making money.

393
00:31:27,979 --> 00:31:29,199
I'll help you out.

394
00:31:29,307 --> 00:31:31,920
I need no help, so just go.

395
00:31:32,815 --> 00:31:34,407
<i>Go.</i>

396
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,541
Ajeosshi.
Anything I can help you with?

397
00:31:39,672 --> 00:31:41,529
No need.

398
00:31:42,736 --> 00:31:44,627
Have a nice day.

399
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:53,319
I'll help you.

400
00:31:53,439 --> 00:31:55,650
I have no jobs to give you.
Just go.

401
00:31:55,761 --> 00:31:56,886
It's okay, I'll still help you.

402
00:31:56,993 --> 00:31:59,585
I said I'm not hiring. Leave.

403
00:31:59,705 --> 00:32:01,727
You don't need to pay money.
I'll just help you with this.

404
00:32:01,823 --> 00:32:03,749
Think I don't get what
you're trying to do?

405
00:32:03,845 --> 00:32:07,986
Don't even think of trying
to get any of these, and leave!

406
00:32:10,212 --> 00:32:12,780
You little scoundrel,
as if I wasn't busy enough...

407
00:32:16,336 --> 00:32:17,783
Ajumma!

408
00:32:18,251 --> 00:32:22,462
Ajumma.
Can you breastfeed the baby?

409
00:32:22,712 --> 00:32:24,493
I'll sing you a song if you do.

410
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,976
<i>I just fed my baby...</i>

411
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:27,161
Ajumma!

412
00:32:27,244 --> 00:32:29,063
Ajumma...

413
00:32:29,171 --> 00:32:30,703
Ajumma.

414
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:33,267
The baby is starving.

415
00:32:33,371 --> 00:32:34,903
Could you help me out?

416
00:32:35,011 --> 00:32:36,830
<i>Sorry.</i>

417
00:32:37,548 --> 00:32:40,013
Ajumma...

418
00:33:25,814 --> 00:33:27,537
Aren't you that...

419
00:33:28,602 --> 00:33:30,959
I won't steal your briquettes,
so don't worry.

420
00:33:31,091 --> 00:33:32,601
Ohh... All right.

421
00:33:35,114 --> 00:33:36,729
Aigoo... That won't do it.

422
00:33:36,813 --> 00:33:38,871
Come and help me pull.

423
00:33:47,893 --> 00:33:50,095
The wheel is stuck, so it won't work.

424
00:33:50,275 --> 00:33:53,673
Ahh... Really, I'm delivering
right around the corner.

425
00:33:53,769 --> 00:33:55,684
Aigoo... What now?

426
00:33:55,875 --> 00:33:58,185
What else can I do?
I'll just have to go back.

427
00:33:58,293 --> 00:34:00,642
- Here...
- Just a second.

428
00:34:28,571 --> 00:34:31,850
It's all right now, so you can go.

429
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:33,621
I'll help you carry it all the way.

430
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,727
Don't ask me for money later.

431
00:34:35,835 --> 00:34:37,953
I'm not expecting any.

432
00:34:38,096 --> 00:34:40,248
You live here?

433
00:34:41,386 --> 00:34:42,849
Yes.

434
00:34:43,851 --> 00:34:48,013
Is that the welfare center?

435
00:34:48,314 --> 00:34:52,227
Yes. A young boy, and a little girl...

436
00:34:52,311 --> 00:34:56,081
Also, there's an infant as well.

437
00:34:56,273 --> 00:34:59,911
They're orphans with nowhere to go.

438
00:35:00,066 --> 00:35:01,397
Yes.

439
00:35:02,885 --> 00:35:05,140
When are you coming?

440
00:35:12,699 --> 00:35:16,960
Oppa, where have you been?
Know how worried I was?

441
00:35:17,441 --> 00:35:18,659
Sorry.

442
00:35:18,827 --> 00:35:19,925
Did you eat?

443
00:35:20,033 --> 00:35:23,085
Yeah... I fed the baby as well.

444
00:35:23,587 --> 00:35:25,538
But, how about you?

445
00:35:25,705 --> 00:35:27,369
I'm fine.

446
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,912
You didn't eat a thing, did you?
I knew it.

447
00:35:31,381 --> 00:35:37,022
Have this. Ajeosshi gave it to me,
so I kept some for you.

448
00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:44,968
By the way,
why is your face so dirty?

449
00:35:48,318 --> 00:35:49,885
I found a job.

450
00:35:49,969 --> 00:35:50,914
A job?

451
00:35:51,021 --> 00:35:53,096
Yeah. Briquette delivery.

452
00:35:54,703 --> 00:35:56,036
Here... Look.

453
00:35:56,168 --> 00:35:59,001
It's all the money I made today.

454
00:36:00,148 --> 00:36:03,606
You're really great,
now you even make money.

455
00:36:11,397 --> 00:36:13,785
I'll have to start by
buying you some new shoes.

456
00:36:13,939 --> 00:36:15,411
It's all right.

457
00:36:15,543 --> 00:36:20,000
We need to save money, if we want
to buy some milk for the baby.

458
00:36:28,702 --> 00:36:29,970
Is it them?

459
00:36:30,066 --> 00:36:31,610
Yes.

460
00:36:32,408 --> 00:36:33,644
What's the matter, Ajumma?

461
00:36:33,728 --> 00:36:36,851
Follow us to the orphanage.

462
00:36:37,899 --> 00:36:38,957
Orphanage?

463
00:36:39,089 --> 00:36:42,500
You'll have it much easier there.

464
00:36:42,641 --> 00:36:45,838
Right. Listen to them.

465
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:50,586
You can even have
your baby adopted overseas.

466
00:36:50,721 --> 00:36:52,001
Adopted overseas?

467
00:36:52,121 --> 00:36:56,028
Do you know how nice
a place to live in America is?

468
00:36:56,196 --> 00:36:59,966
<i>There's plenty to eat,
and with a nice foster family,</i>

469
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:02,141
they can even send you to college.

470
00:37:02,265 --> 00:37:03,088
Isn't that right?

471
00:37:03,196 --> 00:37:04,521
No way!

472
00:37:04,625 --> 00:37:07,103
Forget the orphanage
or taking the baby.

473
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:08,989
I'll raise them all by myself.

474
00:37:09,145 --> 00:37:11,801
<i>You're too young
to have any authority over them.</i>

475
00:37:11,921 --> 00:37:14,338
And we have the responsibility
to protect children like you.

476
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:16,869
<i>Do you understand
what I'm trying to say?</i>

477
00:37:19,364 --> 00:37:21,392
Oppa...

478
00:37:22,445 --> 00:37:23,725
<i>Open the door!</i>

479
00:37:23,833 --> 00:37:26,286
<i>We're here to help you!</i>

480
00:37:26,513 --> 00:37:29,132
I don't need your help, so just leave!

481
00:37:29,316 --> 00:37:32,042
<i>If you really insist,
then let us just take the baby.</i>

482
00:37:32,186 --> 00:37:35,089
<i>You can't raise a baby
all by yourselves.</i>

483
00:37:35,471 --> 00:37:38,571
Oppa, I don't want
to give them the baby.

484
00:37:38,691 --> 00:37:40,677
Let's all live together.

485
00:37:40,785 --> 00:37:42,065
Uh?

486
00:37:47,262 --> 00:37:49,506
I'm not sending you anywhere.

487
00:37:49,781 --> 00:37:52,954
I'll raise you by myself.

488
00:37:53,685 --> 00:37:55,369
<i>Open the door!</i>

489
00:37:55,477 --> 00:37:58,971
<i>What if something happens to the baby?</i>

490
00:37:59,618 --> 00:38:01,953
<i>I said open!</i>

491
00:38:02,811 --> 00:38:04,792
<i>Open!</i>

492
00:38:10,182 --> 00:38:13,617
Whomever it is, try to mess with
my siblings and you'll pay!

493
00:38:13,748 --> 00:38:15,711
<i>Look at him staring down at us!</i>

494
00:38:15,807 --> 00:38:17,315
Drop that down!

495
00:38:17,446 --> 00:38:19,601
I don't need a thing!

496
00:38:20,018 --> 00:38:21,546
I don't need your money,

497
00:38:21,673 --> 00:38:23,252
or anything else,

498
00:38:23,356 --> 00:38:25,452
so just leave us alone!

499
00:38:25,596 --> 00:38:27,223
<i>We're not trying to hurt you.</i>

500
00:38:27,355 --> 00:38:30,227
Our job is taking care
of orphans like you.

501
00:38:30,334 --> 00:38:33,374
We're no orphans!
We have a brother.

502
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,061
A brother?

503
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,991
And where is your brother?

504
00:38:40,162 --> 00:38:41,637
I don't know.

505
00:38:41,817 --> 00:38:44,853
Still, we're going to meet soon.

506
00:38:45,467 --> 00:38:49,149
<i>When we meet,
we'll live together by ourselves.</i>

507
00:38:49,272 --> 00:38:52,778
So we don't need your help!

508
00:38:52,922 --> 00:38:55,259
- All right, so just...
- Who are you?

509
00:38:55,367 --> 00:38:57,246
<i>Honey...</i>

510
00:38:57,485 --> 00:39:00,285
What are you doing here?

511
00:39:00,489 --> 00:39:05,000
You said you'd be late?!
You came home early?

512
00:39:11,642 --> 00:39:14,836
Aigoo... You brat...

513
00:40:02,491 --> 00:40:04,824
We found out where they're
keeping the secret document.

514
00:40:04,968 --> 00:40:06,476
Where is that?

515
00:40:07,316 --> 00:40:08,726
<i>Inside General Hampton's office.</i>

516
00:40:08,869 --> 00:40:11,344
Remember the frame behind his desk?

517
00:40:16,871 --> 00:40:21,036
<i>Behind that frame is a secret safe box.</i>

518
00:40:53,928 --> 00:40:56,334
<i>How many troops there on night shift?</i>

519
00:40:56,465 --> 00:40:58,691
<i>There will be sentinels
guarding the entrance,</i>

520
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:01,647
<i>while those on day duty are always
on stand-by to reinforce them.</i>

521
00:41:01,791 --> 00:41:05,406
I think we should act during
the day, on the contrary.

522
00:41:06,542 --> 00:41:09,879
Then, it has to be when
Hampton leaves his office.

523
00:41:09,999 --> 00:41:13,624
But even without him,
his aide will always be there.

524
00:41:13,738 --> 00:41:15,504
It's not going to be easy.

525
00:41:15,982 --> 00:41:17,358
Keep your ears on the wire.

526
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:19,668
We will get a chance to act.

527
00:41:19,895 --> 00:41:21,494
Yes, Sir.

528
00:41:22,779 --> 00:41:24,387
Who's out there?

529
00:41:28,399 --> 00:41:30,346
Who are you?

530
00:41:36,345 --> 00:41:40,645
I brought back the
uniform from the laundry.

531
00:41:47,557 --> 00:41:49,387
<i>Wait.</i>

532
00:42:01,896 --> 00:42:04,723
The laundry delivers even at night?

533
00:42:06,961 --> 00:42:10,036
I was passing by,
and saw the lights on...

534
00:42:10,144 --> 00:42:12,154
Are you an army officer?

535
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,853
I'm not.

536
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:26,593
Quite young for a paramilitary.

537
00:43:39,273 --> 00:43:40,655
<i>Keep your ears on the wire.</i>

538
00:43:40,786 --> 00:43:43,694
<i>We will get a chance to act.</i>

539
00:43:54,906 --> 00:43:56,278
Were you looking for us?

540
00:43:56,404 --> 00:43:59,790
What's the closest oil depot
to the Compound B barracks?

541
00:44:00,556 --> 00:44:01,271
Yes.

542
00:44:01,403 --> 00:44:04,096
<i>On the hill right behind the barracks.</i>

543
00:44:06,106 --> 00:44:07,075
Personnel on duty?

544
00:44:07,195 --> 00:44:09,696
All troops from our Korean support.

545
00:44:10,737 --> 00:44:13,526
Make that oil depot explode.

546
00:44:15,918 --> 00:44:19,455
If you cause an explosion there,
they'll be forced out to tame the flames.

547
00:44:19,575 --> 00:44:21,562
That's when we'll act.

548
00:44:21,765 --> 00:44:22,998
Understood.

549
00:44:23,153 --> 00:44:25,415
Find when Hampton will be on leave.

550
00:44:25,523 --> 00:44:27,904
That will be our D-Day.

551
00:44:39,946 --> 00:44:41,792
How are you?

552
00:45:22,795 --> 00:45:24,721
Oppa!

553
00:45:27,235 --> 00:45:29,066
It's cold, why did you come out?

554
00:45:29,209 --> 00:45:32,022
You said you'd be home early,
why are you so late?

555
00:45:32,141 --> 00:45:34,516
I had a lot to do today.

556
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:37,142
Instead, I made a ton of money?!

557
00:45:37,226 --> 00:45:38,423
Really?

558
00:45:38,519 --> 00:45:41,738
Here... See what comes out of here.

559
00:45:44,634 --> 00:45:46,493
They're shoes?!

560
00:45:48,116 --> 00:45:50,035
Put them on.

561
00:45:54,343 --> 00:45:56,059
They fit just right.

562
00:45:56,950 --> 00:45:58,340
They're really warm.

563
00:45:58,423 --> 00:46:00,673
Thanks, Oppa.

564
00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:05,050
It's cold... Why take them off?

565
00:46:05,134 --> 00:46:07,181
I want them to last.

566
00:46:07,288 --> 00:46:09,310
I said I'll make a lot of money.

567
00:46:09,466 --> 00:46:11,189
I'll buy another pair,
so come on and wear them.

568
00:46:11,273 --> 00:46:11,871
Nope.

569
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:15,524
I'll put them on
when we go meet Big Oppa.

570
00:46:27,521 --> 00:46:30,760
What if Big Oppa
forgets to come tomorrow?

571
00:46:30,891 --> 00:46:34,493
Think he's like you?
Forgetting things...

572
00:46:35,582 --> 00:46:41,698
If he finds out Mommy died,
he'll start crying?!

573
00:46:44,773 --> 00:46:46,000
Miju.

574
00:46:46,143 --> 00:46:49,111
Will you sing me a song?

575
00:46:49,673 --> 00:46:51,025
Want to hear one?

576
00:46:51,138 --> 00:46:52,414
Yeah...

577
00:46:52,522 --> 00:46:56,128
All right, since you
even bought me shoes...

578
00:46:57,205 --> 00:47:07,389
<i>{\a6}~ Thinking of Oppa (old lullaby) ~</i>

579
00:46:57,205 --> 00:47:07,390
"Here comes the water cock,
quacking on the paddy field."

580
00:47:08,071 --> 00:47:18,543
"Here comes the cuckoo,
echoing in the forest."

581
00:47:18,888 --> 00:47:29,486
"When my Oppa will ride
to Seoul with his horse,"

582
00:47:29,622 --> 00:47:39,439
"He said he will bring me silken shoes."

583
00:47:58,789 --> 00:48:01,529
Aigoo... I said I won't steal it.

584
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:03,326
Iron this one for me.

585
00:48:03,482 --> 00:48:04,956
I'm going out now.

586
00:48:05,068 --> 00:48:06,150
Out?

587
00:48:06,270 --> 00:48:07,910
Meeting someone?

588
00:48:08,936 --> 00:48:10,554
I'll finish this one first.

589
00:48:10,638 --> 00:48:12,529
Ohh... You...

590
00:48:12,884 --> 00:48:14,934
First time I see you this way?!

591
00:48:15,078 --> 00:48:16,223
Going somewhere nice?

592
00:48:16,355 --> 00:48:17,672
Tell me.

593
00:48:18,063 --> 00:48:19,548
Is it a girl?

594
00:48:20,950 --> 00:48:23,583
It is... Right? It's a girl!
Admit it.

595
00:48:23,691 --> 00:48:25,522
It's not...

596
00:48:32,632 --> 00:48:35,691
General Hampton just left the base.

597
00:48:35,850 --> 00:48:36,792
How about the oil depot?

598
00:48:36,875 --> 00:48:39,498
We've completed all preparatives.

599
00:48:43,686 --> 00:48:44,991
If this fails,

600
00:48:45,110 --> 00:48:46,900
we're all dead.

601
00:48:46,996 --> 00:48:49,244
You must succeed
without a single blemish.

602
00:48:49,333 --> 00:48:50,628
Is that clear?

603
00:48:51,142 --> 00:48:52,630
Yes, Sir.

604
00:48:52,705 --> 00:48:54,463
Loyalty!

605
00:49:13,899 --> 00:49:18,075
<i>I think we should act during
the day, on the contrary.</i>

606
00:49:41,021 --> 00:49:42,098
Yes.

607
00:49:42,241 --> 00:49:44,213
Yes, copy that.

608
00:50:54,410 --> 00:50:59,114
Fire in the oil depot!
Hurry up and put out the fire!

609
00:51:24,631 --> 00:51:26,101
Aigoo... You're going?

610
00:51:26,207 --> 00:51:29,593
Yes. Thank you for everything.

611
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:33,303
You had started growing on me
the last few days?!

612
00:51:33,446 --> 00:51:35,804
So your brother
is only a high schooler?

613
00:51:35,947 --> 00:51:39,364
You're going to have it hard,
dealing with an infant and all.

614
00:51:39,531 --> 00:51:42,846
They're clever,
so they'll find a way to make it.

615
00:51:43,029 --> 00:51:44,414
You can find 31 Building
by yourself, right?

616
00:51:44,521 --> 00:51:47,346
Yes. Goodbye.

617
00:51:47,537 --> 00:51:48,483
Goodbye.

618
00:51:48,554 --> 00:51:50,655
Aigoo... Right...

619
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:56,603
- Bye
- Bye!

620
00:51:57,082 --> 00:52:00,253
- What's wrong with you...
- Bye.

621
00:53:20,007 --> 00:53:21,877
Drop the knife.

622
00:53:28,898 --> 00:53:30,624
<i>Drop it!</i>

623
00:54:08,810 --> 00:54:10,577
<i>Who's there?</i>

624
00:54:17,658 --> 00:54:19,633
Goddamned kid.

625
00:54:20,105 --> 00:54:21,906
Jesus... Halt!

626
00:54:22,026 --> 00:54:23,588
Halt...

627
00:54:24,915 --> 00:54:25,884
Jesus... Kid.

628
00:54:26,003 --> 00:54:28,637
Kid... Kid... Are you all right?

629
00:54:29,187 --> 00:54:31,168
<i>Hey... Medic!</i>

630
00:54:31,274 --> 00:54:33,041
<i>Hey... Kid, come on!</i>

631
00:54:33,147 --> 00:54:35,984
<i>Hey... Medic!</i>

632
00:54:40,406 --> 00:54:44,520
Did he see your face?

633
00:54:46,231 --> 00:54:51,377
Did he see your face or not, you idiot?

634
00:54:53,307 --> 00:54:56,244
He... might have.

635
00:54:56,336 --> 00:54:58,489
You useless fool!

636
00:55:01,870 --> 00:55:02,797
I deserve to be punished!

637
00:55:02,905 --> 00:55:04,865
Who are we dealing with?

638
00:55:04,974 --> 00:55:06,362
It's that paramilitary from the laundry.

639
00:55:06,478 --> 00:55:07,399
Where is he now?

640
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:10,092
He's in the infirmary,
still unconscious.

641
00:55:10,879 --> 00:55:14,160
If he regains his senses,
it's all over for us.

642
00:55:14,316 --> 00:55:16,099
Do you get it?

643
00:55:17,091 --> 00:55:22,122
Before that happens,
I'll get rid of him myself.

644
00:55:38,249 --> 00:55:40,972
We have done all we can.

645
00:55:41,522 --> 00:55:43,748
It's up to him now.

646
00:55:44,036 --> 00:55:45,256
Take him to a specialist.

647
00:55:45,412 --> 00:55:47,247
He needs to wake up.

648
00:55:50,034 --> 00:55:51,150
We have an eye-witness,

649
00:55:51,270 --> 00:55:54,110
who can positively identify
the criminal leaving the building.

650
00:55:54,215 --> 00:55:56,306
We're working on a composite sketch.

651
00:55:56,404 --> 00:56:00,443
The suspect was looking
precisely for the document.

652
00:56:31,952 --> 00:56:33,448
Hurry up!

653
00:56:33,579 --> 00:56:35,805
Get going! Quick!

654
00:58:40,585 --> 00:58:42,799
<i>Who are you?</i>

655
00:58:52,747 --> 00:58:55,223
What brings you here, if I may ask...

656
00:58:55,391 --> 00:58:57,099
I came to the wrong ward.

657
00:58:57,207 --> 00:58:58,777
Wait.

658
00:58:59,902 --> 00:59:00,800
Wait a moment.

659
00:59:00,908 --> 00:59:02,403
<i>Stop.</i>

660
00:59:05,648 --> 00:59:07,285
Wait...

661
00:59:08,126 --> 00:59:09,024
You!

662
00:59:09,179 --> 00:59:11,238
Major Jo's assistant?!

663
00:59:14,254 --> 00:59:16,324
Looks like him.

664
00:59:20,604 --> 00:59:25,060
What are you doing here?

665
00:59:29,403 --> 00:59:31,283
You were here.

666
00:59:33,425 --> 00:59:35,203
I was looking for you.

667
00:59:35,371 --> 00:59:37,489
Ahh... Here's my aide.

668
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:39,176
Remember?

669
00:59:39,787 --> 00:59:41,199
Good.

670
00:59:41,963 --> 00:59:44,095
You and I have to talk, Major.

671
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:47,194
You bring him with you.

672
00:59:49,407 --> 00:59:51,082
Fine with me.

673
00:59:51,274 --> 00:59:55,259
This fire at the depot was without
a doubt our support officers' mistake.

674
00:59:55,438 --> 00:59:57,610
As their officer in charge,
I take all responsibility,

675
00:59:57,732 --> 00:59:59,627
and I'd like to extend
my sincerest apologies to you.

676
01:00:00,105 --> 01:00:03,868
Someone ransacked my office.

677
01:00:04,019 --> 01:00:06,250
Are you saying a theft took place?

678
01:00:06,633 --> 01:00:11,228
Luckily we have a soldier who
witnessed the person leaving this room.

679
01:00:12,489 --> 01:00:14,225
Come on in.

680
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:26,097
I think this is the right guy.

681
01:00:30,805 --> 01:00:34,537
Are you trying to accuse him
of being a thief?

682
01:00:34,707 --> 01:00:38,044
No, not a thief. A spy.

683
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:39,883
Arrest him.

684
01:00:41,848 --> 01:00:46,518
What if it turns out your
subordinate made a wrong call?

685
01:00:47,533 --> 01:00:50,764
I'm sure that most Koreans
look the same to you.

686
01:00:50,895 --> 01:00:54,550
If you accuse my aide of espionage
based only on his assumptions,

687
01:00:54,647 --> 01:00:58,417
then I'll have to officially
file a complaint to my superiors.

688
01:00:58,584 --> 01:01:01,636
Sir... We're being bugged.

689
01:01:02,805 --> 01:01:05,176
<i>He knew exactly
where the document was.</i>

690
01:01:05,302 --> 01:01:08,217
Only you and I knew where it was.

691
01:01:08,325 --> 01:01:10,112
So the only way
they could have known...

692
01:01:10,244 --> 01:01:12,620
is if we were bugged.

693
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:23,108
Bugged?!

694
01:01:24,335 --> 01:01:25,406
Go ahead.

695
01:01:25,598 --> 01:01:27,476
File a complaint.

696
01:01:32,299 --> 01:01:33,842
But if there's a bug
inside this orchid pot,

697
01:01:33,938 --> 01:01:36,877
it's gonna be you who's
held responsible for destroying...

698
01:01:36,973 --> 01:01:40,479
the military relationship
between our two countries.

699
01:01:42,477 --> 01:01:44,153
Wait!

700
01:01:47,539 --> 01:01:49,052
But instead,

701
01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:54,389
if there is no bug inside,
what will you do?

702
01:02:21,647 --> 01:02:23,071
It's a shame.

703
01:02:23,717 --> 01:02:28,103
I thought of you as
a good friend of mine.

704
01:02:29,647 --> 01:02:34,278
However, for the sake of
our countries' relationship,

705
01:02:34,453 --> 01:02:38,071
I will make a personal effort
to ignore this incident.

706
01:02:43,783 --> 01:02:45,984
We have another witness.

707
01:02:46,643 --> 01:02:50,269
Until he regains consciousness,
we'll keep your aide.

708
01:03:30,034 --> 01:03:33,434
Oppa!
It's snowing!

709
01:03:34,398 --> 01:03:35,907
Mom told me,

710
01:03:35,991 --> 01:03:39,712
that when it snows,
you'll meet the people you miss.

711
01:03:39,904 --> 01:03:42,588
Hyung will be here for sure today.

712
01:03:42,713 --> 01:03:44,439
I have no doubt.

713
01:03:44,822 --> 01:03:47,491
Big Oppa!
Hurry up and come!

714
01:03:47,587 --> 01:03:50,640
I miss you, Big Oppa!

715
01:04:17,513 --> 01:04:22,156
Gangmo...
Miju...

716
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:26,787
Gangmo...

717
01:04:27,015 --> 01:04:29,181
Miju...

718
01:04:31,161 --> 01:04:33,411
Gangmo...

719
01:04:34,722 --> 01:04:36,642
Miju...

<i>Why isn't Big Oppa coming?</i>

727
01:05:28,009 --> 01:05:31,056
<i>He's hiding somewhere else,
and then will suddenly appear.</i>

728
01:05:31,247 --> 01:05:32,145
Who are you?

729
01:05:32,253 --> 01:05:33,652
<i>Where do you come from?</i>

730
01:05:33,761 --> 01:05:37,117
<i>Why did you send me that note,
and who the hell are you?</i>

731
01:05:37,272 --> 01:05:38,703
<i>Ohh?! Big Oppa!</i>

732
01:05:38,811 --> 01:05:40,139
Oppa!

733
01:05:40,235 --> 01:05:41,970
Little Oppa...

734
01:05:42,078 --> 01:05:43,698
What are you doing?

735
01:05:43,777 --> 01:05:45,548
Just getting rid of all the dirt.

736
01:05:45,644 --> 01:05:47,283
For free?!

737
01:05:47,567 --> 01:05:48,647
<i>Tell me.</i>

738
01:05:49,002 --> 01:05:51,567
Is he the one responsible?

739
01:05:51,663 --> 01:05:53,303
It was not him.

740
01:05:53,458 --> 01:05:55,265
Who gave you permission
to shine shoes here?

741
01:05:55,397 --> 01:05:56,864
<i>Why, can't I do that here?</i>

742
01:05:56,965 --> 01:05:59,767
<i>How dare you barge in
on someone else's turf?</i>

743
01:05:59,895 --> 01:06:02,305
I'm no real estate speculator.

744
01:06:02,437 --> 01:06:04,112
Listen, Director Hwang!

745
01:06:04,244 --> 01:06:07,068
<i>Sell that land or block the river,
I couldn't care less.</i>

746
01:06:07,222 --> 01:06:10,374
All I want you to do is making the most
money in the shortest amount of time.

747
01:06:10,506 --> 01:06:14,658
If you lose my favor,
you'll only end up in misery.
