4
00:00:08,167 --> 00:00:10,307
Whether you'll choose
this land deed as collateral,

5
00:00:10,414 --> 00:00:13,423
or my business plan instead,

6
00:00:13,551 --> 00:00:16,109
I leave the decision to you.

7
00:00:16,464 --> 00:00:19,038
How much are you looking for?

8
00:00:19,802 --> 00:00:21,256
I'd like to borrow five hundred million.

9
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,998
Listen to that.

10
00:00:23,221 --> 00:00:26,383
Not a penny of interest, 
and 500 million?

11
00:00:29,589 --> 00:00:35,619
If I choose your
business plan as collateral?

12
00:00:35,882 --> 00:00:39,975
You'd eventually be rewarded
with immense dividends down the line.

13
00:00:41,335 --> 00:00:43,748
And if I choose the land deed instead?

14
00:00:44,343 --> 00:00:48,414
I no longer need you.

15
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:52,732
Choose one of the two.

16
00:00:55,922 --> 00:01:00,809
I need neither, so take them back.

17
00:01:03,853 --> 00:01:07,273
Haven't you heard 
I don't need any of this?

18
00:01:12,173 --> 00:01:14,395
I apologize for wasting your time.

19
00:01:23,174 --> 00:01:26,218
Might be a contract 
without any conditions,

20
00:01:26,383 --> 00:01:29,661
but you still need to sign it 
before you leave.

21
00:01:34,315 --> 00:01:40,977
The money will be wired to
your account in the morning.

22
00:01:41,562 --> 00:01:42,996
Sir.

23
00:01:47,849 --> 00:01:50,470
What I need as collateral...

24
00:01:50,658 --> 00:01:54,810
is neither that land deed 
nor any business plan.

25
00:01:54,939 --> 00:01:56,455
It's none other than...

26
00:01:56,737 --> 00:01:59,335
James Lee, you.

27
00:01:59,428 --> 00:02:02,373
I will not disappoint you.

28
00:02:07,179 --> 00:02:13,701
It's the only part of my body 
where blood doesn't flow.

29
00:02:14,312 --> 00:02:17,144
I must have been about
your age when it happened.

30
00:02:18,383 --> 00:02:21,243
I needed money to buy
medicines for my mother,

31
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:29,210
so I pledged this hand as collateral
for a mere sack of rice's worth.

32
00:02:29,845 --> 00:02:35,190
Unable to pay the money on time,

33
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:43,616
that loan shark forever 
took away this hand from me.

34
00:02:45,992 --> 00:02:48,389
That is what money can do to people.

35
00:02:48,671 --> 00:02:50,633
Everyone desires it,

36
00:02:50,815 --> 00:02:54,852
but if that desire is only marked by greed,
money can truly become poison.

37
00:02:56,539 --> 00:02:59,183
<i>Always bear it in mind.</i>

38
00:02:59,783 --> 00:03:05,658
<i>All I lost for not living up to 
my end of the bargain was this hand,</i>

39
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:13,124
but you will lose everything,
from head to toes.

40
00:03:13,617 --> 00:03:18,835
And you brought this
daunting ordeal upon yourself.

41
00:03:25,644 --> 00:03:30,692
I will take it as an encouragement
to succeed at all cost.

42
00:03:35,392 --> 00:03:39,952
The keen memories of my first kiss were 
like a light wading through my destiny's path,

43
00:03:35,392 --> 00:03:39,952
<i>{\a6}- Han Yongun's "Your Silence" (1926) -</i>

44
00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:42,290
A feeble step into the shadows
of darkness, soon vanishing.

45
00:03:42,478 --> 00:03:45,263
Deafened as I was by the
sweet sound of your words,

46
00:03:45,357 --> 00:03:50,001
That fresh and delicate beauty
of yours blinded me with passion.

47
00:03:56,718 --> 00:03:57,911
Here...

48
00:03:58,031 --> 00:04:02,006
Anyone willing to talk about these
"keen memories of a first kiss"?

49
00:04:02,465 --> 00:04:04,709
<i>Why, nobody is willing?</i>

50
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:08,517
<i>- Hangang Construction -
CEO James Lee</i>

51
00:04:10,174 --> 00:04:13,398
I never imagined you'd end up
running a construction company.

52
00:04:13,491 --> 00:04:15,710
We just got started.

53
00:04:15,932 --> 00:04:17,954
You will do well 
no matter the path you take.

54
00:04:18,071 --> 00:04:21,141
It might be from afar, 
but you'll always have my support.

55
00:04:21,517 --> 00:04:24,055
I don't need your support.

56
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:29,109
What I need is your strength,
which is why I'm here.

57
00:04:29,373 --> 00:04:33,600
As you're well aware,
I know nothing about construction.

58
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:38,549
From here on in, we'll use new technologies
to fight off huge corporations.

59
00:04:39,219 --> 00:04:43,873
I need people like you, 
who know how to deal with the press.

60
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:47,343
By "huge corporations,"

61
00:04:47,707 --> 00:04:50,633
do you mean Manbo Construction?

62
00:04:56,392 --> 00:04:58,154
And Jeongshik?

63
00:04:58,437 --> 00:05:01,013
He didn't come home last night.

64
00:05:01,124 --> 00:05:05,971
And your wife refuses to eat,
always looking for the bottle.

65
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:09,016
Make sure she doesn't drink.

66
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:12,897
It's not like she would listen to me.

67
00:05:20,098 --> 00:05:21,943
<i>Jeongyeon, you...</i>

68
00:05:23,635 --> 00:05:28,664
Pretending you were still suffering
from aphasia even with me...

69
00:05:29,581 --> 00:05:32,248
made me feel betrayed as your father,

70
00:05:32,495 --> 00:05:35,432
not to mention all the disheartenment.

71
00:05:37,066 --> 00:05:38,561
I apologize, Dad.

72
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:40,238
However,

73
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:43,187
as the chairman of Manbo Construction,

74
00:05:43,387 --> 00:05:48,264
I only have compliments
for your brilliant plan.

75
00:05:50,591 --> 00:05:54,281
We will soon have to announce
the new personnel changes...

76
00:05:54,422 --> 00:05:56,714
Where would you like to work?

77
00:05:57,302 --> 00:05:59,241
I'd like to be promoted to 
Director of Planning.

78
00:05:59,455 --> 00:06:01,473
Director of Planning?!

79
00:06:02,338 --> 00:06:06,490
But I was already planning to
assign that post to Jo Minwoo...

80
00:06:06,584 --> 00:06:08,781
I need no other position.

81
00:06:09,604 --> 00:06:12,107
I'd like to become Director of Planning.

82
00:06:13,188 --> 00:06:19,058
Then, I'll have to give Minwoo 
some other position.

83
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:22,573
I believe it's still
too early for a promotion.

84
00:06:24,228 --> 00:06:25,521
For the time being,

85
00:06:25,721 --> 00:06:29,141
I think working under me as
Chief of Planning would be better.

86
00:06:30,821 --> 00:06:35,931
I need capable people like him working 
for me to improve as a leader, Dad.

87
00:06:36,601 --> 00:06:37,823
Sure.

88
00:06:38,034 --> 00:06:42,547
That doesn't sound 
too bad to me, either.

89
00:06:44,263 --> 00:06:46,021
Go ahead, then.

90
00:06:51,575 --> 00:06:54,008
<i>You heinous brat...</i>

91
00:06:54,516 --> 00:06:58,735
So you dare stab me 
in the back like that?

92
00:07:02,131 --> 00:07:06,526
But that owner of the Royal Club...

93
00:07:06,989 --> 00:07:10,181
Why is she looking after her interests?

94
00:07:10,679 --> 00:07:14,282
Why on earth would she be doing that...

95
00:07:25,303 --> 00:07:26,843
Leave.

96
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:31,004
I don't even want to see you, 
so get out of my face!

97
00:07:31,167 --> 00:07:35,376
Transfer all your shares
and Jeongshik's to me.

98
00:07:35,586 --> 00:07:36,855
What?!

99
00:07:37,128 --> 00:07:38,514
Transfer our shares to you?!

100
00:07:38,608 --> 00:07:43,268
You once told me you'd grace me with
a last act of generosity, if I recall?

101
00:07:43,392 --> 00:07:47,544
<i>I will repay the courtesy and be 
generous for one last time, then.</i>

102
00:07:47,682 --> 00:07:50,197
You have one week 
to make up your mind.

103
00:07:50,526 --> 00:07:54,494
If you let that week pass,
no excuse will be tolerated.

104
00:07:54,647 --> 00:07:57,009
You ruthless wench!

105
00:07:59,007 --> 00:08:02,932
Still letting violence do the talking?

106
00:08:03,521 --> 00:08:05,324
Go ahead and hit me, then.

107
00:08:08,944 --> 00:08:10,095
Why?

108
00:08:10,283 --> 00:08:12,751
Now that I'm Manbo Construction's heir,

109
00:08:12,888 --> 00:08:14,960
does that scare you?

110
00:08:20,144 --> 00:08:24,586
If you believe you already
gained control of that company,

111
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,349
you're sorely mistaken.

112
00:08:26,784 --> 00:08:29,569
Manbo Construction's heir?!

113
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,753
Take a good look.

114
00:08:31,983 --> 00:08:33,375
I'm your mother.

115
00:08:33,584 --> 00:08:35,749
The chairman's wife.

116
00:08:36,054 --> 00:08:37,288
And?

117
00:08:37,484 --> 00:08:42,459
Think that if I oppose it, 
you will ever get to become chairman?

118
00:08:42,612 --> 00:08:44,232
Dream on!

119
00:08:44,678 --> 00:08:47,769
I'm not taking this lying down.

120
00:08:48,451 --> 00:08:50,777
Then, go ahead and try to stop me.

121
00:08:51,119 --> 00:08:54,820
And then see what happens to
you and Jeongshik if you do.

122
00:08:54,987 --> 00:08:56,195
Say what?

123
00:08:56,359 --> 00:08:59,012
I recall you said you'd take away 
all my shares for incompetence,

124
00:08:59,106 --> 00:09:01,997
and trap me inside a hospital room 
for the rest of my days?

125
00:09:02,256 --> 00:09:07,544
Seems like you'd be more suited 
to a hospital room instead?

126
00:09:11,685 --> 00:09:15,180
It's been long since the last time you've
been able to sleep without drinking all day.

127
00:09:15,277 --> 00:09:18,877
Are you trying to threaten me?

128
00:09:19,148 --> 00:09:20,410
Yes.

129
00:09:20,581 --> 00:09:22,497
That is exactly what I'm doing.

130
00:09:22,689 --> 00:09:26,464
You know, I only 
learned that from the best.

131
00:09:26,745 --> 00:09:28,791
Don't you remember?

132
00:09:29,407 --> 00:09:35,995
When you told me to keep sleeping 
for the rest of my days.

133
00:09:37,949 --> 00:09:41,627
Your every day will soon resemble hell.

134
00:09:42,497 --> 00:09:48,316
But if you'd rather avoid all that, you
can always sleep for the rest of your days.

135
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:51,434
Did I make myself clear?

136
00:09:58,722 --> 00:10:01,606
That scary wench...

137
00:10:02,464 --> 00:10:05,061
Scary, heinous wench.

138
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:08,951
My heart.

139
00:10:09,068 --> 00:10:10,467
My heart...

140
00:10:10,573 --> 00:10:12,183
That wench...

141
00:10:12,542 --> 00:10:16,180
That wench is finally
showing her true colors!

142
00:10:26,827 --> 00:10:27,826
Chief.

143
00:10:27,955 --> 00:10:31,027
Have you heard about
today's personnel announcement?

144
00:10:31,135 --> 00:10:32,262
I know.

145
00:10:32,364 --> 00:10:34,817
I just got a call from
personnel administration,

146
00:10:34,969 --> 00:10:38,765
and you weren't on 
the list of promotions.

147
00:10:40,563 --> 00:10:41,990
Is that true?

148
00:10:42,149 --> 00:10:44,793
Yes. I'm positive.

149
00:10:47,002 --> 00:10:48,969
The chairman arrived already, right?

150
00:10:49,188 --> 00:10:51,062
Congratulations.

151
00:10:51,244 --> 00:10:55,474
You know you had our support at the 
last shareholders' meeting, don't you?

152
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:56,918
Thank you.

153
00:10:57,028 --> 00:10:59,900
But, why are you packing?

154
00:11:08,857 --> 00:11:10,796
<i>Chief Jo Minwoo?</i>

155
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:15,516
Take these and follow me.

156
00:11:16,002 --> 00:11:17,354
Hwang Jeongyeon...

157
00:11:17,448 --> 00:11:19,656
Chief.

158
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:25,081
Miss Jeongyeon was just
promoted to Director of Planning.

159
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:28,950
I've really learned a lot from you all.

160
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:31,110
I hope I can continue counting on you.

161
00:11:34,211 --> 00:11:36,949
Take these and follow me inside.

162
00:11:49,544 --> 00:11:51,852
<i>- Director of Planning -
HWANG Jeongyeon</i>

163
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:53,548
Yes?

164
00:12:01,574 --> 00:12:05,358
Our highway construction has already 
gone over budget by 30 percent.

165
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,929
If this keeps up, it's obvious
we'll face significant losses,

166
00:12:09,118 --> 00:12:11,119
so how are you going to
take responsibility for that?

167
00:12:11,222 --> 00:12:13,173
How shall I take responsibility?

168
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,607
Would my resignation suffice?

169
00:12:14,748 --> 00:12:17,285
Even if a hundred people 
like you resign,

170
00:12:17,438 --> 00:12:19,213
it still won't give us any
solution to our problems.

171
00:12:19,307 --> 00:12:20,334
Hey, Hwang Jeongyeon.

172
00:12:20,441 --> 00:12:22,245
Careful with your language.

173
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:24,362
I'm your direct superior.

174
00:12:24,442 --> 00:12:27,327
Why did you change so suddenly?

175
00:12:27,644 --> 00:12:30,688
Now that you've been proclaimed heir,
you ignore everyone in your way?

176
00:12:30,794 --> 00:12:34,143
You were the ones responsible
for this "sudden change."

177
00:12:34,425 --> 00:12:36,728
You and Hwang Jeongshik.

178
00:12:37,281 --> 00:12:39,262
What are you implying?

179
00:12:40,549 --> 00:12:44,503
What were you implying
with what you just said?

180
00:12:45,626 --> 00:12:47,083
If you keep up with the attitude,

181
00:12:47,165 --> 00:12:51,612
I'm afraid it won't end with security
forcibly kicking you out of this office.

182
00:12:53,765 --> 00:12:57,683
Whatever it takes, we must successfully
complete the highway construction.

183
00:12:58,129 --> 00:13:01,819
Bring me a report on all existing
issues and possible solutions.

184
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,216
Is that clear, Chief Jo?

185
00:13:04,804 --> 00:13:08,027
Yes, understood.

186
00:13:09,856 --> 00:13:14,420
Shouldn't you show your superior
some respect and nod before you leave?

187
00:13:30,823 --> 00:13:32,344
<i>Oppa...</i>

188
00:13:32,453 --> 00:13:33,763
<i>Oppa!</i>

189
00:13:33,868 --> 00:13:35,067
<i>Wake up.</i>

190
00:13:35,126 --> 00:13:38,310
<i>How can you get drunk
at this hour, already?</i>

191
00:13:40,155 --> 00:13:42,258
Oppa, you have a guest.

192
00:13:42,361 --> 00:13:43,751
Hurry and get up.

193
00:13:43,845 --> 00:13:45,350
Leave us alone.

194
00:13:45,668 --> 00:13:46,849
Oppa!

195
00:13:46,978 --> 00:13:49,187
Get the hell out!

196
00:13:57,531 --> 00:13:59,719
Hey, Hwang Jeongshik.
Wake up.

197
00:14:00,624 --> 00:14:01,689
Minwoo?

198
00:14:01,805 --> 00:14:03,544
Let's have a drink.

199
00:14:05,902 --> 00:14:08,098
Get a hold of yourself, you fool!

200
00:14:08,216 --> 00:14:11,960
That hurts...
What's wrong with you?

201
00:14:12,066 --> 00:14:14,769
Did you ever make a mistake
in Jeongyeon's presence?

202
00:14:14,957 --> 00:14:17,359
What are you talking about, 
all of a sudden?

203
00:14:17,624 --> 00:14:22,113
Did you ever tell Jeongyeon
we killed Lee Gangmo?

204
00:14:22,266 --> 00:14:23,794
Give me a break...

205
00:14:23,968 --> 00:14:25,172
What am I, crazy?

206
00:14:25,277 --> 00:14:27,510
Why would I tell her that...

207
00:14:27,757 --> 00:14:33,186
Jeongyeon seemed 
to be aware of something.

208
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:41,091
Ho...How would she know that?

209
00:14:41,234 --> 00:14:42,402
She said so herself?

210
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:45,210
That we killed Gangmo?

211
00:14:52,473 --> 00:14:56,723
<i>- Will you marry me? -</i>

212
00:15:07,023 --> 00:15:08,891
<i>Gangmo.</i>

213
00:15:09,976 --> 00:15:12,452
<i>Bear witness from heaven,</i>

214
00:15:13,557 --> 00:15:19,766
<i>to the punishment those
who killed you will have to face,</i>

215
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:23,491
<i>and how I will avenge you.</i>

216
00:15:24,431 --> 00:15:27,204
<i>Take a good look, Gangmo.</i>

217
00:15:31,878 --> 00:15:36,929
<i>- Jungwon Construction Highway Site -
Safety First ~ Prevention of Calamities</i>

218
00:15:40,786 --> 00:15:44,601
Seems like they're facing
some kind of trouble?!

219
00:15:44,696 --> 00:15:48,175
They've won concessions for the longest
tract of the Daejeon-Busan highway...

220
00:15:48,296 --> 00:15:50,373
out of all the provincial
construction companies.

221
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:52,668
What if they throw us out, too?

222
00:15:52,774 --> 00:15:56,598
What do you think? We'll have
to face whatever comes our way.

223
00:16:00,107 --> 00:16:02,934
Look, Director Im!

224
00:16:03,227 --> 00:16:07,875
Think I don't know you already supplied 
your entire lot of sand and gravel...

225
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:10,473
to Manbo Construction?

226
00:16:10,685 --> 00:16:12,224
How can I help you?

227
00:16:12,765 --> 00:16:14,273
I came to meet the director.

228
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:18,437
So only huge corporations have the
right to work in the construction trade?

229
00:16:18,545 --> 00:16:20,729
He's busy right now, 
so please come another time.

230
00:16:20,844 --> 00:16:22,367
Just a moment.

231
00:16:22,485 --> 00:16:24,364
You stubborn fool, really...

232
00:16:24,478 --> 00:16:26,575
You no longer need sand or gravel.

233
00:16:26,704 --> 00:16:28,703
What's with him, now?

234
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:32,320
I can give you the
solution to your problems.

235
00:16:32,429 --> 00:16:35,048
What are you doing?
Get him out of my sight.

236
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,087
<i>Director!</i>

237
00:16:37,299 --> 00:16:40,432
Over five million housing units 
are being built nationwide.

238
00:16:40,613 --> 00:16:42,505
It won't be easy to
find any sand or gravel.

239
00:16:42,622 --> 00:16:45,522
And?!
Should I just give up?

240
00:16:45,642 --> 00:16:48,545
Even only with mud and cement,
you can get the basics covered.

241
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:52,655
Listen... I have twenty years
of experience in this trade.

242
00:16:52,773 --> 00:16:55,582
If there is such a method,
I'll put my hand into the fire.

243
00:16:55,687 --> 00:16:57,673
Just give me a chance.

244
00:16:57,803 --> 00:16:59,873
- If I don't make it...
- Ahh... Shut up.

245
00:16:59,965 --> 00:17:02,760
What are you waiting for?
Get this conman out of my sight.

246
00:17:02,865 --> 00:17:05,555
Director! 
I assure you I can do it!

247
00:17:05,673 --> 00:17:06,389
<i>Director!</i>

248
00:17:06,472 --> 00:17:08,434
Just give me a chance!

249
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:12,242
I assure you... 
Give me a chance!

250
00:17:12,653 --> 00:17:16,371
What's the use of having a killer app,
when nobody gives you a chance?

251
00:17:16,465 --> 00:17:19,085
Aigoo... Foolish twats.

252
00:17:19,226 --> 00:17:22,567
They wouldn't know a goldmine
if it hit them in the ass.

253
00:17:23,198 --> 00:17:24,644
Sotae.

254
00:17:24,926 --> 00:17:26,888
Find out how Manbo Construction's
highway project is proceeding.

255
00:17:27,018 --> 00:17:28,612
Manbo Construction? Why?

256
00:17:28,719 --> 00:17:31,663
Want to work with them?

257
00:17:31,959 --> 00:17:33,707
I said hurry up and go find out.

258
00:17:33,818 --> 00:17:35,285
All right.

259
00:17:35,402 --> 00:17:37,235
Fine...

260
00:18:00,726 --> 00:18:03,704
Does it make sense you haven't
even poured any asphalt yet?

261
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:04,785
I apologize.

262
00:18:04,844 --> 00:18:05,608
Chief.

263
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:08,158
Because the ground
is made of soil cement here,

264
00:18:08,228 --> 00:18:11,978
it's natural that it'd be more expensive
and take much longer to complete.

265
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:14,548
Whatever it takes, you must
complete the construction...

266
00:18:14,659 --> 00:18:18,089
within budget and on time, is that clear?

267
00:18:19,095 --> 00:18:21,853
For starters, increase the 
laborers' workload.

268
00:18:21,964 --> 00:18:24,921
Anyone coming short of the mark,
fire them on the spot and replace them.

269
00:18:25,019 --> 00:18:26,859
Yes, all right.

270
00:18:31,782 --> 00:18:35,134
That's Jo Minwoo.

271
00:18:45,663 --> 00:18:46,985
Chief Moon.

272
00:18:47,202 --> 00:18:47,924
Yes?

273
00:18:48,006 --> 00:18:51,872
Looked like they were using 
sand and gravel to harden the land.

274
00:18:52,014 --> 00:18:55,245
Is there no way to harden the
existing soil without using that?

275
00:18:55,424 --> 00:18:58,197
I've cut my teeth on
engineering works myself,

276
00:18:58,294 --> 00:19:00,449
but I've never heard of such method.

277
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,019
Call our R&D team and
tell them to find a way.

278
00:19:03,126 --> 00:19:04,518
Yes, I will.

279
00:19:04,628 --> 00:19:05,778
Wait.

280
00:19:05,888 --> 00:19:08,451
I'll go there myself.

281
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:11,784
What?

282
00:19:11,964 --> 00:19:13,798
Jo Minwoo was at the construction site?

283
00:19:13,927 --> 00:19:18,710
Seeing how he just barged in there 
changing all plans on the fly,

284
00:19:18,828 --> 00:19:21,491
I'm sure he was entrusted
control of the entire operation.

285
00:19:21,643 --> 00:19:27,190
Forget everything else, 
but can we lose out to Jo Minwoo?

286
00:19:28,178 --> 00:19:30,457
That prick needs to be dealt with.

287
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:32,972
Why, did he con you out of your money?

288
00:19:33,094 --> 00:19:35,299
Hyungnim... When words don't work,
how do you convince people?

289
00:19:35,393 --> 00:19:40,165
When words don't work,
you just start cursing a storm at them.

290
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:43,766
Ehhh... Why, don't you 
use your tongue to curse?

291
00:19:44,078 --> 00:19:47,481
If they refuse to listen,
you just beat it into them.

292
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:50,718
Sotae. 
Put shovels and cement in the car.

293
00:19:50,836 --> 00:19:52,566
Hardener as well.

294
00:19:52,706 --> 00:19:54,154
And then what?

295
00:19:54,268 --> 00:19:57,800
Words are not going to work with 
Jungwon Construction's director.

296
00:19:58,054 --> 00:20:00,644
We'll have to show him he can trust us.

297
00:20:04,052 --> 00:20:06,933
I apologize for what happened last time.

298
00:20:08,285 --> 00:20:10,102
It's all right.

299
00:20:10,306 --> 00:20:14,579
If I think of all the help
you've given me, that's nothing.

300
00:20:16,863 --> 00:20:19,163
Jo Pilyeon is acting strange as of late.

301
00:20:19,273 --> 00:20:21,345
Strange?!

302
00:20:21,552 --> 00:20:25,766
Seems like he gave up the elections
and remains in his office all day?

303
00:20:25,869 --> 00:20:28,265
I know Jo Pilyeon better than anyone.

304
00:20:29,252 --> 00:20:32,853
Once his prey is right within range,

305
00:20:33,653 --> 00:20:38,692
that's when things quiet down
to an eerie, worrying silence.

306
00:20:39,246 --> 00:20:42,325
There's a huge approval
rate margin, already.

307
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:46,866
<i>Even Jo Pilyeon wouldn't be
able to turn this ship around.</i>

308
00:20:46,964 --> 00:20:48,756
That's that,

309
00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:52,720
but how about you follow me 
and enter the political arena?

310
00:20:53,431 --> 00:20:55,140
I have no interest in politics.

311
00:20:55,244 --> 00:20:56,840
It's just because you're still young.

312
00:20:56,928 --> 00:20:58,825
Wait until you get to my age.

313
00:20:59,201 --> 00:21:02,605
You'll discover that nothing can
tickle your fancy like politics.

314
00:21:25,887 --> 00:21:27,591
<i>Honey.</i>

315
00:21:27,803 --> 00:21:30,553
Is this the time to be sleeping?

316
00:21:31,893 --> 00:21:35,430
The elections are
right around the corner!

317
00:21:35,726 --> 00:21:38,366
And your approval rate
is scraping the bottom.

318
00:21:38,478 --> 00:21:39,786
So?

319
00:21:39,974 --> 00:21:42,751
Are you just going to
give up on the elections?

320
00:21:42,855 --> 00:21:44,804
If you really want to shock the world,

321
00:21:44,933 --> 00:21:47,069
you must know how to wait 
for the right time.

322
00:21:47,179 --> 00:21:48,094
You just wait.

323
00:21:48,188 --> 00:21:50,739
Because exactly when everyone
considers me dead and buried,

324
00:21:50,856 --> 00:21:54,589
that'll be the moment when
I explode back onto the scene.

325
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,810
I can't believe this...

326
00:21:59,653 --> 00:22:00,703
I'm back.

327
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:03,238
- Everything ready?
- Yes.

328
00:22:03,849 --> 00:22:06,286
All that is left is making your move.

329
00:22:06,397 --> 00:22:10,531
- How about the press?
- A few major papers will be present.

330
00:22:11,124 --> 00:22:14,142
What is this about, suddenly?

331
00:22:14,318 --> 00:22:16,927
You get ready as well.

332
00:22:19,423 --> 00:22:20,551
What?

333
00:22:20,915 --> 00:22:24,182
The chief of Candidate Min's
Youth Group met with Go Jaechun?!

334
00:22:24,323 --> 00:22:25,287
Yes.

335
00:22:25,463 --> 00:22:28,448
The two looked to be
discussing something in secret.

336
00:22:28,662 --> 00:22:30,671
And who are we dealing with?

337
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:33,529
He's a gang leader active
in the Maljukgeori area.

338
00:22:33,638 --> 00:22:34,853
Where's Jo Pilyeon now?

339
00:22:34,968 --> 00:22:37,996
We just got word he's heading
for the redevelopment area.

340
00:22:38,454 --> 00:22:41,286
He's scheming something for sure.

341
00:22:41,729 --> 00:22:43,073
Follow me.

342
00:22:54,654 --> 00:23:00,040
I'm independent candidate Jo Pilyeon.

343
00:23:07,113 --> 00:23:11,791
Everyone, we brought some ramen
and other supplies.

344
00:23:11,909 --> 00:23:15,658
<i>No matter how hard it is, 
never lose hope.</i>

345
00:23:15,831 --> 00:23:17,802
Aigoo, thank you very much.

346
00:23:17,939 --> 00:23:19,702
It must be hard, Sir.

347
00:23:19,819 --> 00:23:21,874
<i>- Thank you.
- Don't even mention it.</i>

348
00:23:21,998 --> 00:23:28,169
Seeing you face so many difficulties
just breaks my heart.

349
00:23:30,214 --> 00:23:34,868
This country is being
increasingly dominated by the rich.

350
00:23:34,973 --> 00:23:38,515
But if I will be elected as congressman,

351
00:23:38,661 --> 00:23:44,196
I will fight for powerless
working-class people like you.

352
00:23:44,748 --> 00:23:47,439
Didn't you work for the KCIA?

353
00:23:48,391 --> 00:23:49,484
And?

354
00:23:49,593 --> 00:23:51,493
Is there anything wrong with that?

355
00:23:51,602 --> 00:23:53,762
Someone currying favor
with the big shots like you...

356
00:23:53,891 --> 00:23:56,007
would fight for the working class?

357
00:23:56,124 --> 00:23:58,016
<i>Think anyone here would be 
so foolish to believe that?</i>

358
00:23:58,157 --> 00:24:00,840
Not to mention that you're a
pro-Japanese collaborator's descendant.

359
00:24:00,965 --> 00:24:03,225
You'll pardon me,
but I must ask you to leave.

360
00:24:03,434 --> 00:24:05,081
<i>The clearance squads are coming!</i>

361
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:07,368
The clearance squads!

362
00:24:18,442 --> 00:24:21,107
If we let them go through, 
we'll all be dead!

363
00:24:21,236 --> 00:24:23,856
Fight back to the very end!

364
00:24:27,577 --> 00:24:31,990
I thought I told you to
clear this area by today?!

365
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:36,361
You insolent fools, how dare
you kick us out of our own homes?

366
00:24:36,469 --> 00:24:40,345
We're never going to leave!
Just kill us instead, you bastards!

367
00:24:40,462 --> 00:24:41,896
Is that so?

368
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:44,270
Be my guest, then.

369
00:24:44,646 --> 00:24:47,548
- Boys!
- Yes!

370
00:24:48,782 --> 00:24:50,639
Get them out of my sight!

371
00:24:54,424 --> 00:24:57,133
Stop... Stop it!

372
00:24:57,601 --> 00:24:59,379
I said stop!

373
00:25:01,552 --> 00:25:03,404
Stop it.

374
00:25:05,966 --> 00:25:07,525
And who are you?

375
00:25:07,651 --> 00:25:09,197
These are my area people.

376
00:25:09,315 --> 00:25:12,240
- Leave!
- Listen, candidate fella.

377
00:25:12,342 --> 00:25:15,658
What we're doing is perfectly legal,

378
00:25:15,811 --> 00:25:18,833
it's these people who are 
acting against the law.

379
00:25:18,941 --> 00:25:21,581
- Understand what I mean?
- People come before the law.

380
00:25:21,722 --> 00:25:24,372
What kind of law 
oppresses innocent people?

381
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:26,194
Seems like you don't want to listen.

382
00:25:26,276 --> 00:25:27,827
- Boys!
- Yes!

383
00:25:27,921 --> 00:25:30,213
Teach them a lesson!

384
00:26:01,552 --> 00:26:03,655
Honey!!

385
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:12,069
Hang in there, everyone!

386
00:26:12,163 --> 00:26:14,632
<i>Justice always prevails!</i>

387
00:26:14,726 --> 00:26:18,650
Fight to the end and protect your land!

388
00:26:19,392 --> 00:26:21,578
<i>Don't give up!</i>

389
00:26:42,904 --> 00:26:45,631
He's coming... It's him!

390
00:26:45,737 --> 00:26:47,749
Excuse me... 
Please, free the way.

391
00:26:48,099 --> 00:26:51,072
<i>Please, free the way!</i>

392
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:55,141
- Honey, are you all right?
- Please, move out of the way.

393
00:26:55,839 --> 00:26:57,177
Can you explain the situation to us?

394
00:26:57,271 --> 00:27:01,349
Give us a comment on your feelings after 
sacrificing for those displaced people.

395
00:27:04,252 --> 00:27:07,757
Here... Here... We need to
stabilize his condition first.

396
00:27:07,902 --> 00:27:09,723
It's all right.

397
00:27:09,841 --> 00:27:12,968
As hard as it might be, 
just a comment.

398
00:27:13,108 --> 00:27:19,390
I'm more concerned 
about those poor people...

399
00:27:21,829 --> 00:27:23,597
Are they...

400
00:27:24,796 --> 00:27:27,534
doing all right?

401
00:27:28,552 --> 00:27:31,034
This won't do it, free the way!

402
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:41,084
It's all a ruse.

403
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:43,840
That was exactly what
Jo Pilyeon was planning.

404
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:47,863
That clearance squad leader was
the chief of Min Honggi's Youth Group.

405
00:27:48,122 --> 00:27:49,203
What?!

406
00:27:49,364 --> 00:27:51,095
I'm sure of it.

407
00:27:51,631 --> 00:27:53,351
Then, we must catch him immediately.

408
00:27:53,457 --> 00:27:55,290
Take all the boys 
and find him right now!

409
00:27:55,384 --> 00:27:56,888
All right.

410
00:28:11,532 --> 00:28:15,228
<i>- The Birth of a Real Politician -
Gangnam's Independent Candidate Jo Pilyeon</i>

411
00:28:15,351 --> 00:28:17,392
<i>- Independent Candidate Jo Pilyeon -
Martyrdom for the Sake of Working Class</i>

412
00:28:18,309 --> 00:28:19,819
What the hell is all this?

413
00:28:19,941 --> 00:28:22,277
Jo Pilyeon becomes a hero
to the working class?

414
00:28:22,401 --> 00:28:26,451
Every paper is busy
praising Candidate Jo's actions.

415
00:28:26,568 --> 00:28:30,533
And Jo's approval rate in his area 
is rapidly on the rise.

416
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:34,082
If this keeps up, what if Jo Pilyeon 
really ends up winning the elections?

417
00:28:34,211 --> 00:28:38,292
Fox hunts are the noisiest,

418
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:40,748
while tigers prefer to hunt in silence.

419
00:28:40,866 --> 00:28:42,800
What is that supposed 
to mean, Hyungnim?

420
00:28:42,916 --> 00:28:45,836
For the entire campaign,
Candidate Min has prevailed.

421
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:48,832
But after keeping quiet
until the very last moment,

422
00:28:48,954 --> 00:28:51,146
look at how Jo Pilyeon turned
the tide in just one strike.

423
00:28:51,264 --> 00:28:55,577
Then, that tiger you
always talked about...

424
00:28:55,911 --> 00:28:58,703
There is this old saying,
"yukchamgoldan."

425
00:28:58,815 --> 00:29:03,354
Sacrifice my own flesh
to gain my foe's bones?!

426
00:29:04,164 --> 00:29:08,894
Then, are you suggesting it was
all a stratagem by Jo Pilyeon?

427
00:29:09,014 --> 00:29:12,578
Stratagem or not,
what would it matter now?

428
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:18,892
What really matters is that these elections 
are within Jo Pilyeon's grasp now.

429
00:29:24,215 --> 00:29:26,906
Aigoo... Really...

430
00:29:29,327 --> 00:29:31,842
Are you laughing at this?!

431
00:29:32,148 --> 00:29:35,503
I was dying of concern in there.

432
00:29:38,876 --> 00:29:43,007
Minwoo, you should have 
seen that firsthand.

433
00:29:43,117 --> 00:29:44,476
I apologize, Dad.

434
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:47,636
I was in the provinces 
and heard about it too late.

435
00:29:47,801 --> 00:29:49,740
What I'm saying...

436
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:57,503
is that you should have witnessed how
your father completely turned the tide.

437
00:29:57,987 --> 00:30:03,226
Was this all a plan of yours?

438
00:30:03,438 --> 00:30:10,280
Do you really think I righteously 
sacrificed my body to protect those people?

439
00:30:13,236 --> 00:30:17,396
I don't believe in justice.

440
00:30:17,596 --> 00:30:22,760
It's nothing but a pretext used by 
people to rationalize their weakness.

441
00:30:22,871 --> 00:30:25,617
Because if you claim
you led a righteous life,

442
00:30:25,725 --> 00:30:30,421
then you'll be able to wash away that 
painful stigma people call failure.

443
00:30:31,345 --> 00:30:34,479
Justice will never matter
as much as success.

444
00:30:34,586 --> 00:30:36,569
Winning.

445
00:30:38,602 --> 00:30:44,043
So Jeongyeon became
heir of Manbo Construction?

446
00:30:44,383 --> 00:30:47,205
<i>From now on in, 
she's whom you will be facing.</i>

447
00:30:47,299 --> 00:30:53,768
Find a way to contend with her
and get your hands on that company.

448
00:30:59,233 --> 00:31:02,342
Min Honggi is waiting outside.

449
00:31:06,349 --> 00:31:08,370
Tell him to come in.

450
00:31:12,276 --> 00:31:15,102
- Please, come in.
- Are you all right?

451
00:31:18,708 --> 00:31:20,365
Sir.

452
00:31:20,685 --> 00:31:23,445
Honey, I'll let you two talk, then.

453
00:31:26,717 --> 00:31:29,452
So... How are we feeling?

454
00:31:29,831 --> 00:31:32,666
Your generosity always humbles me.

455
00:31:32,787 --> 00:31:34,846
You even think of paying me a visit.

456
00:31:34,956 --> 00:31:40,493
We might be rivals, but won't you
join politics as well, down the line?

457
00:31:40,591 --> 00:31:43,787
We'll one day become colleagues, 
so paying a visit...

458
00:31:43,929 --> 00:31:49,808
So you seem to believe that
you'll win these elections.

459
00:31:49,921 --> 00:31:53,650
Throwing a rock into the river 
won't turn the tide.

460
00:31:53,774 --> 00:31:56,611
A few ripples is the
best you can hope for.

461
00:31:57,633 --> 00:32:03,015
You'll soon be able to read
quite the interesting article.

462
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:10,153
Let me borrow your ear.

463
00:32:17,204 --> 00:32:23,061
Turns out that the clearance
squad leader who attacked me...

464
00:32:23,789 --> 00:32:28,017
was the chief of your election 
campaign's Youth Group?!

465
00:32:28,537 --> 00:32:30,023
What?!

466
00:32:30,523 --> 00:32:33,394
Give a good read to all those articles.

467
00:32:33,512 --> 00:32:37,237
One of us will become a
hero to the working class,

468
00:32:37,367 --> 00:32:44,218
<i>while the other will become a political
thug surrounding himself with gangsters.</i>

469
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:52,780
You were behind all of this!

470
00:32:53,377 --> 00:32:56,259
It was a ruse from the very beginning.

471
00:32:57,399 --> 00:32:59,224
Jaechun.

472
00:32:59,459 --> 00:33:02,820
Candidate Min said
he'll have to get going.

473
00:33:50,059 --> 00:33:53,637
<i>- Orphan -</i>

474
00:33:57,961 --> 00:33:59,830
<i>I believe my biggest strengths
are the fact I'm always...</i>

475
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:02,333
<i>cheerful and optimistic.</i>

476
00:34:02,533 --> 00:34:08,336
<i>My late mother always told me there is nothing 
I can't do, if I really work hard for it.</i>

477
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:12,349
<i>I had to grow up as an orphan
and face many difficulties,</i>

478
00:34:12,489 --> 00:34:15,021
<i>but I never let that discourage me.</i>

479
00:34:15,141 --> 00:34:19,109
<i>I've witnessed many people
facing even more struggles than me.</i>

480
00:34:19,233 --> 00:34:20,728
<i>As for my biggest dream,</i>

481
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:25,863
<i>it is that of becoming the kind of
singer who can give hope to those people.</i>

482
00:34:25,992 --> 00:34:30,602
<i>I wish this world could become
a better, more cheerful place.</i>

483
00:35:00,806 --> 00:35:03,580
<i>- Oh... Here's the chief.
- Chief.</i>

484
00:35:03,771 --> 00:35:05,342
- Did I miss anything?
- No.

485
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:07,292
Chief.

486
00:35:08,043 --> 00:35:11,243
While you were away,
they sent you a lunchbox.

487
00:35:11,369 --> 00:35:14,428
We thought it'd all go bad,
so we helped ourselves.

488
00:35:14,546 --> 00:35:17,754
There was a letter inside the lunchbox.

489
00:35:27,276 --> 00:35:31,210
<i>You haven't picked up the phone,
these last few days?!</i>

490
00:35:31,334 --> 00:35:34,018
<i>I'm often at the library 
next to the office.</i>

491
00:35:34,124 --> 00:35:37,588
<i>My GED test is coming up soon.</i>

492
00:36:01,551 --> 00:36:03,261
Excuse me.

493
00:36:05,399 --> 00:36:08,368
Drink this while you study.

494
00:36:09,877 --> 00:36:12,662
I've already had coffee.

495
00:36:12,791 --> 00:36:16,970
Let's talk a moment.

496
00:36:17,428 --> 00:36:19,403
What's the matter?

497
00:36:19,814 --> 00:36:21,486
I'm not some kind of stalker,

498
00:36:21,583 --> 00:36:23,645
and I major in business 
administration at Korea University.

499
00:36:23,786 --> 00:36:27,264
I've had my eyes on you for a while.

500
00:36:27,746 --> 00:36:30,839
<i>I'd like to go out with you.</i>

501
00:36:31,192 --> 00:36:33,283
<i>I already have a boyfriend.</i>

502
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:37,420
<i>Ehh... I could be a much
better catch than him.</i>

503
00:36:37,573 --> 00:36:39,099
You know Ohseong Confectionery, right?

504
00:36:39,213 --> 00:36:40,942
I got a job there.

505
00:36:41,037 --> 00:36:45,183
If you lose this chance to go out
with me, you'll regret it later.

506
00:36:45,344 --> 00:36:49,509
My boyfriend is much more
successful than you.

507
00:36:53,623 --> 00:36:56,312
<i>He's already chief of planning.</i>

508
00:36:57,526 --> 00:36:59,391
<i>Depends on what company he works for.</i>

509
00:36:59,485 --> 00:37:02,963
Being chief of planning for
a small firm is no big deal.

510
00:37:03,361 --> 00:37:07,214
You've heard of Manbo
Construction, haven't you?

511
00:37:07,319 --> 00:37:09,188
<i>Ma...Manbo Construction?!</i>

512
00:37:09,294 --> 00:37:12,457
<i>Also, you can't imagine how cool he is.</i>

513
00:37:12,565 --> 00:37:16,380
You can't even begin to compare.

514
00:37:26,342 --> 00:37:29,139
What do you want from my girlfriend?

515
00:37:30,549 --> 00:37:32,253
I apologize.

516
00:38:02,143 --> 00:38:03,438
<i>GED Test
- English -</i>

517
00:38:05,722 --> 00:38:09,819
If you keep staring at me like that,
how can I concentrate?

518
00:38:09,932 --> 00:38:12,188
And who's staring at you?

519
00:38:12,812 --> 00:38:15,549
Was just looking 
if you got the answers right.

520
00:38:18,616 --> 00:38:22,060
You weren't much of a student, were you?

521
00:38:23,446 --> 00:38:24,716
Chief.

522
00:38:24,833 --> 00:38:26,244
Minwoo.

523
00:38:26,549 --> 00:38:27,804
Uh?!

524
00:38:28,412 --> 00:38:30,153
You said I'm your boyfriend.

525
00:38:30,321 --> 00:38:32,566
Who calls her boyfriend "Chief"?

526
00:38:57,789 --> 00:39:00,093
I'm sorry, Chief.

527
00:39:00,486 --> 00:39:04,347
Someone like me shouldn't 
even lie about that.

528
00:39:04,437 --> 00:39:06,285
Someone like you?!

529
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:09,399
Why, what's wrong with you?

530
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:17,648
It's not like I come from a good
family or have an elite job like you.

531
00:39:17,954 --> 00:39:19,533
Stop it.

532
00:39:20,461 --> 00:39:23,234
My family is not as "good" as you think.

533
00:39:27,101 --> 00:39:30,039
Stop thinking such nonsense
and worry about studying.

534
00:39:30,133 --> 00:39:33,442
With those skills of yours, 
it'll take a hundred years to get your GED.

535
00:39:33,572 --> 00:39:36,357
What's wrong with my skills?

536
00:39:39,624 --> 00:39:41,903
They're almost all wrong, sh...

537
00:39:48,222 --> 00:39:52,547
From now on, I'll give you an hour
of special tutoring every day.

538
00:39:54,157 --> 00:39:55,461
What?

539
00:39:56,331 --> 00:40:01,313
Why? Afraid I'll expose
the fact you're a dummy?

540
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:04,380
Aren't you busy?

541
00:40:05,203 --> 00:40:06,789
I am.

542
00:40:11,177 --> 00:40:15,422
Here... Let's start 
with English for today.

543
00:40:15,591 --> 00:40:17,109
Pay attention.

544
00:40:47,851 --> 00:40:50,072
Can we finish by tomorrow morning?

545
00:40:50,213 --> 00:40:53,549
We must. If you don't finish
before they come to work,

546
00:40:53,684 --> 00:40:54,947
we'll be screwed.

547
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:57,156
But will this be 
enough to convince them?

548
00:40:57,238 --> 00:41:00,160
If they witness it firsthand, 
they'll believe us.

549
00:41:00,505 --> 00:41:02,392
Let's hurry up.

550
00:41:56,693 --> 00:41:58,369
The sun's already up.

551
00:41:58,474 --> 00:42:01,064
They'll soon start arriving?!

552
00:42:01,157 --> 00:42:02,670
How long will it take until we finish?

553
00:42:02,775 --> 00:42:04,961
At the very least, two hours.

554
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:08,487
But if they file a complaint with the
police because we dug up their land,

555
00:42:08,557 --> 00:42:11,488
we'll be screwed, won't we?

556
00:42:11,582 --> 00:42:12,814
Sotae.

557
00:42:12,917 --> 00:42:15,131
Take the truck and block the entrance.

558
00:42:16,024 --> 00:42:18,997
Stop them from coming in 
and buy us some time.

559
00:42:19,126 --> 00:42:21,378
- All by myself?
- That's right.

560
00:42:21,482 --> 00:42:23,904
What am I, a seawall?

561
00:42:24,013 --> 00:42:25,518
There's only an hour left
until they come to work.

562
00:42:25,694 --> 00:42:27,093
So just hold them back
for the remaining hour.

563
00:42:27,163 --> 00:42:28,938
Ahh... I'll be damned...

564
00:42:29,008 --> 00:42:31,731
Doesn't your face 
suggest a way, you fool?

565
00:42:31,846 --> 00:42:33,873
What way does my face suggest?

566
00:42:33,979 --> 00:42:36,021
Let's hear it, if there's one.

567
00:42:36,214 --> 00:42:36,884
Come here.

568
00:42:36,978 --> 00:42:40,515
I can barely stand,
why don't you come here?

569
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:49,500
Uh?!

570
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:54,678
Don't move!

571
00:42:54,787 --> 00:42:58,962
Stay away... Back off!

572
00:42:59,197 --> 00:43:03,449
Listen... If you really
want to kill yourself,

573
00:43:03,578 --> 00:43:05,176
don't do it here, uh?

574
00:43:05,364 --> 00:43:08,338
Let's... right...
Let's have a talk, shall we?

575
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:11,140
Think this is a show?

576
00:43:11,381 --> 00:43:13,403
<i>{\a6}Words on his chest: "I wanna die"</i>

576
00:43:11,381 --> 00:43:13,403
Fine... Fine... Fine!

577
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,979
I'll set myself on fire.

578
00:43:15,073 --> 00:43:17,541
<i>Back off or we'll all croak!</i>

579
00:43:17,635 --> 00:43:22,540
I've already sold off all my kidneys,
and there's nothing left inside!

580
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:24,709
Here, if anyone wants to 
croak together, be my guest.

581
00:43:24,815 --> 00:43:28,562
<i>{\a6}Words on headband: "My wish is"
(with a glaring grammar mistake)</i>

581
00:43:24,815 --> 00:43:28,562
Go ahead and come!

582
00:43:34,596 --> 00:43:38,094
Aigoo... It's killing me.

583
00:43:38,219 --> 00:43:41,303
What kind of torture is this?

584
00:43:41,421 --> 00:43:44,829
Let's hang in there, Hyungnim.
It's almost done.

585
00:43:45,804 --> 00:43:48,342
<i>Don't move!</i>

586
00:43:53,067 --> 00:43:54,744
My wish!

587
00:43:54,848 --> 00:43:55,942
Is croaking here!

588
00:43:56,036 --> 00:43:58,264
- What's the matter?
- He's attempting suicide.

589
00:43:58,373 --> 00:44:00,575
What?! Attempting suicide?

590
00:44:00,776 --> 00:44:03,616
Are you the boss here?
The boss has come? Fine!

591
00:44:03,709 --> 00:44:06,438
Take a good look.

592
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:09,391
Here's the fire...

593
00:44:09,498 --> 00:44:12,333
Here... Come and join me!

594
00:44:12,427 --> 00:44:15,648
Let's all croak like real men!

595
00:44:15,776 --> 00:44:17,179
Is that even gasoline?

596
00:44:17,298 --> 00:44:18,620
<i>I... I think so.</i>

597
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:22,228
You think so? Can't you go 
and check if it smells right?

598
00:44:22,369 --> 00:44:24,308
Oh?! B...Back off!

599
00:44:24,413 --> 00:44:26,047
I'll set myself on fire... Don't!

600
00:44:26,117 --> 00:44:27,622
<i>Director... It's dangerous!</i>

601
00:44:27,716 --> 00:44:30,012
Think if I set myself on fire,
I'll be the only one to croak?

602
00:44:30,137 --> 00:44:33,930
The fire will just spread 
and kill you all!

603
00:44:37,056 --> 00:44:39,030
What the hell...

604
00:44:40,593 --> 00:44:42,732
You little prick, 
acting like an idiot with water?

605
00:44:42,873 --> 00:44:44,259
No... No! It's gasoline!

606
00:44:44,318 --> 00:44:46,247
Get him off.

607
00:44:50,784 --> 00:44:53,087
<i>Wait... Wait!</i>

608
00:44:53,522 --> 00:44:55,598
Just a moment... Wait.

609
00:44:56,612 --> 00:44:57,823
Aren't you that...

610
00:44:57,928 --> 00:45:01,979
I told you that you could build a road 
even without sand and gravel, right?

611
00:45:02,226 --> 00:45:02,978
What?

612
00:45:03,074 --> 00:45:05,516
Come see for yourself.

613
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:10,581
If you witness it firsthand,
you'll finally believe me.

614
00:45:13,942 --> 00:45:17,374
Are you sure he only
used cement and hardener?

615
00:45:17,466 --> 00:45:18,513
I'm positive.

616
00:45:18,611 --> 00:45:20,429
<i>I verified it firsthand.</i>

617
00:45:21,082 --> 00:45:26,998
If it really tightened it up, 
then it could revolutionize our business.

618
00:45:30,914 --> 00:45:33,458
Leave us your number and go.

619
00:45:33,571 --> 00:45:34,959
We'll call you again 
once we have the results.

620
00:45:35,088 --> 00:45:37,074
It will dry out 
by the end of the day.

621
00:45:37,909 --> 00:45:40,358
We'll be waiting here.

622
00:45:48,266 --> 00:45:50,888
Should we order something to eat?

623
00:45:51,052 --> 00:45:52,780
Those fools...

624
00:45:52,885 --> 00:45:56,552
<i>They don't even realize 
they hit the jackpot.</i>

625
00:45:56,705 --> 00:46:00,923
Is this how you treat your benefactors?

626
00:46:04,719 --> 00:46:05,941
Did it dry out?

627
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:07,613
Yes!

628
00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:09,238
So how about it?

629
00:46:09,326 --> 00:46:09,981
It's...

630
00:46:10,087 --> 00:46:14,728
It'll be more than three times stronger 
than normal sand and gravel mixtures.

631
00:46:14,846 --> 00:46:16,092
In terms of simple finances,

632
00:46:16,186 --> 00:46:18,541
it means you will be able to reduce 
total costs by up to forty percent.

633
00:46:18,612 --> 00:46:21,867
Fo...Forty percent?!

634
00:46:23,328 --> 00:46:25,252
You're really impressive.

635
00:46:25,393 --> 00:46:28,121
Let's sign the contract right away.

636
00:46:29,121 --> 00:46:30,351
What are you waiting for?

637
00:46:30,461 --> 00:46:33,125
Let's bring these
gentlemen some coffee.

638
00:46:33,234 --> 00:46:39,122
You said you'd throw your hand
into the fire if we succeeded, right?

639
00:46:39,933 --> 00:46:40,725
What?

640
00:46:40,849 --> 00:46:43,811
That'll be good enough for me.

641
00:46:45,398 --> 00:46:48,044
Have a nice day.

642
00:46:48,665 --> 00:46:50,345
Help us out.

643
00:46:50,451 --> 00:46:53,910
Without any sand or gravel to 
work with, we're going through hell!

644
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,621
Tell us your conditions,
we'll satisfy them all.

645
00:46:56,726 --> 00:46:59,980
<i>I beg you, 
help us out just this once.</i>

646
00:47:03,176 --> 00:47:04,998
I only have two conditions.

647
00:47:05,315 --> 00:47:11,308
First, allow our Hangang Construction
to take over part of your project.

648
00:47:11,718 --> 00:47:12,943
Sure.

649
00:47:13,050 --> 00:47:15,932
And what's the other condition?

650
00:47:16,025 --> 00:47:19,110
Royalties will be twenty percent 
of total construction costs.

651
00:47:19,262 --> 00:47:23,693
That's a bit...
We're so deep in the red...

652
00:47:23,834 --> 00:47:24,892
Fine.

653
00:47:24,996 --> 00:47:26,586
Let's make that fifteen, then.

654
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:28,101
I can't go below that.

655
00:47:28,209 --> 00:47:29,124
Fine.

656
00:47:29,229 --> 00:47:31,345
Yes... Let's sign the
contract right away!

657
00:47:31,450 --> 00:47:39,019
Also, introduce us to 
all your fellow directors.

658
00:47:39,117 --> 00:47:40,657
Don't you worry about that.

659
00:47:40,823 --> 00:47:45,277
I have more than one friend who was
going through the same headache.

660
00:47:58,968 --> 00:48:02,097
Why are the site superintendent
and his senior staff still missing?

661
00:48:02,201 --> 00:48:05,160
I told them you'd be coming today...

662
00:48:05,266 --> 00:48:06,584
Try to understand them.

663
00:48:06,693 --> 00:48:10,801
Few people would like to see women
prancing around their construction site.

664
00:48:24,502 --> 00:48:26,418
Didn't know you'd be here, Chief.

665
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:28,886
It's the director!

666
00:48:31,719 --> 00:48:34,151
Aigoo... I apologize
for not recognizing you.

667
00:48:34,276 --> 00:48:37,508
- I'm superintendent...
- Already had a drink?

668
00:48:37,642 --> 00:48:39,017
What?

669
00:48:42,795 --> 00:48:44,483
I smell alcohol from here?!

670
00:48:44,852 --> 00:48:48,412
We had lunch with a few landlords here,
so a few drinks would be natural.

671
00:48:48,494 --> 00:48:51,573
<i>That's inevitable in this line of...</i>

672
00:48:52,936 --> 00:48:55,909
Gather all your 
senior staff this evening.

673
00:48:56,027 --> 00:48:56,720
Director...

674
00:48:56,802 --> 00:48:59,422
You make this mess at work
and still have the guts to drink?

675
00:48:59,534 --> 00:49:01,326
Is this how you earn your paychecks?

676
00:49:01,385 --> 00:49:04,150
It's not that,
the situation forced us...

677
00:49:04,687 --> 00:49:07,178
I'm still not done talking!

678
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:12,832
When you come this evening,
bring your letters of resignation along.

679
00:49:16,875 --> 00:49:19,260
Don't you know who that is?

680
00:49:19,484 --> 00:49:24,147
She's Director Hwang Jeongyeon,
who recently was proclaimed heir.

681
00:49:24,406 --> 00:49:27,297
Of all the people you could mess with...

682
00:49:40,146 --> 00:49:42,718
Here... We're done.

683
00:49:42,841 --> 00:49:45,101
I can wire you the 
money tomorrow, right?

684
00:49:45,213 --> 00:49:46,930
Yes. As you prefer.

685
00:49:47,034 --> 00:49:51,448
Here... So...
Let's give it our best.

686
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:54,985
- Yes.
- See you again.

687
00:49:56,337 --> 00:50:00,732
- Have a nice day.
- Yes. To you as well.

688
00:50:02,396 --> 00:50:04,748
Next, come in.

689
00:50:13,571 --> 00:50:15,640
Came to sign a contract?

690
00:50:16,343 --> 00:50:17,107
I'm afraid not.

691
00:50:17,201 --> 00:50:20,949
Then, what else 
would you come here for?

692
00:50:22,947 --> 00:50:24,651
Wait a moment...

693
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:26,943
You look familiar?!

694
00:50:27,754 --> 00:50:29,716
It's been a long time.

695
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:31,260
Ahh... Right!

696
00:50:31,426 --> 00:50:33,370
Samcheong!

697
00:50:33,741 --> 00:50:37,372
This is Lee Myeongsu,
who writes for a trade magazine.

698
00:50:37,454 --> 00:50:39,440
I've heard a lot about you.

699
00:50:39,581 --> 00:50:41,384
I was really surprised to hear the news.

700
00:50:41,514 --> 00:50:44,945
So I wanted to write a special 
on your new method.

701
00:50:45,055 --> 00:50:46,945
As long as you leave
personal questions out of it,

702
00:50:47,033 --> 00:50:48,300
I'm always available.

703
00:50:48,413 --> 00:50:50,546
But, have you requested a patent?

704
00:50:50,668 --> 00:50:52,234
<i>Yes.</i>

705
00:50:57,094 --> 00:50:59,034
- Here.
- Yes.

706
00:50:59,734 --> 00:51:03,181
Wow... So young and 
already this skilled...

707
00:51:03,345 --> 00:51:05,004
Anyhow, once our 
special is published,

708
00:51:05,101 --> 00:51:09,064
you'll hear people wanting to sign
a contract from all over the country.

709
00:51:09,771 --> 00:51:11,775
Congrats, President Lee.

710
00:51:12,192 --> 00:51:14,025
Here... Let's have a drink.

711
00:51:14,119 --> 00:51:14,930
Cheers... Cheers...

712
00:51:14,989 --> 00:51:16,874
Here... To President Lee.

713
00:51:16,984 --> 00:51:19,125
Cheers!

714
00:51:24,792 --> 00:51:27,295
Hey... Heard them, right?

715
00:51:28,106 --> 00:51:32,642
They'll come in droves asking to
sign with us, from all over the country.

716
00:51:32,834 --> 00:51:36,082
Then, will we end up sitting
on a mountain of money?

717
00:51:36,187 --> 00:51:38,803
That's not the issue...

718
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,221
At least for what concerns
Hangang Construction,

719
00:51:41,319 --> 00:51:45,141
you and I get to
be called Director, you fool.

720
00:51:45,266 --> 00:51:48,022
Di...rector?!

721
00:51:50,337 --> 00:51:55,355
Going through that torture at the
Samcheong camp still feels like yesterday...

722
00:51:56,448 --> 00:51:59,785
So there were days like
this even for Park Sotae...

723
00:52:00,561 --> 00:52:03,816
The hell are you, crying?
Stop it!

724
00:52:03,969 --> 00:52:05,671
As if you weren't doing the same.

725
00:52:05,764 --> 00:52:07,841
These are not tears, you fool!

726
00:52:07,962 --> 00:52:09,363
It's sweat! Look.

727
00:52:09,481 --> 00:52:11,643
Isn't it sweat what's coming down?

728
00:52:11,714 --> 00:52:13,359
Mine's sweat, too. You fool.

729
00:52:13,429 --> 00:52:14,546
What... "Fool"?

730
00:52:14,651 --> 00:52:19,669
You little prat, a little wine and
you go spouting fool this and fool that?

731
00:52:19,799 --> 00:52:23,007
- When did I call you that?
- You just did, you fool!

732
00:52:23,101 --> 00:52:26,124
- When did I?
- Ahh... Pardon me.

733
00:52:26,227 --> 00:52:29,488
You've heard him, right?
He called me fool!

734

Here... Here...

735

<i>- Letter of Resignation -</i>

737
00:53:13,381 --> 00:53:17,071
It's a letter of resignation
giving up my rights as heir.

738
00:53:21,489 --> 00:53:26,096
Always carry that letter
in your mind as you work.

739
00:53:26,307 --> 00:53:29,033
If this project should fail,

740
00:53:29,143 --> 00:53:32,359
I will present my resignation 
to the chairman.

741
00:53:32,721 --> 00:53:38,881
<i>If that happens, 
you will have to do the same.</i>

742
00:53:40,617 --> 00:53:44,236
Fill your glasses with soju.

743
00:53:59,228 --> 00:54:02,002
From now on in,
we're on the same boat.

744
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:04,825
If I become the next chairman,

745
00:54:04,963 --> 00:54:07,291
you will also be promoted.

746
00:54:07,738 --> 00:54:09,183
If I hand in my resignation,

747
00:54:09,277 --> 00:54:12,215
you will all become unemployed.

748
00:54:13,187 --> 00:54:16,070
Now our goal is crystal clear.

749
00:54:17,304 --> 00:54:19,204
Surviving.

750
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:24,257

up to the very end.

00:55:03,404 --> 00:55:07,111
- So why did you drink so much...
- Gangmo.

757
00:55:08,689 --> 00:55:14,304
Gangmo, how was I today?

758
00:55:14,719 --> 00:55:17,188
Did I do well?

759
00:55:19,386 --> 00:55:23,788
You should compliment me...

760
00:55:26,075 --> 00:55:32,329
I really gave my best...

761
00:55:33,352 --> 00:55:37,346
You were great today.

762

792
00:58:17,916 --> 00:58:19,054
Mom!

793
00:58:19,171 --> 00:58:21,581
Did you need to take me along, 
especially in this state?

794
00:58:21,690 --> 00:58:26,463
So, what, should I just let
you doze off at home all day?

795
00:58:26,690 --> 00:58:30,993
Aigoo... They even served you drinks 
at other stumping sessions...

796
00:58:31,075 --> 00:58:33,332
Aigoo... You really...

797
00:58:33,708 --> 00:58:36,000
- Yes! Yes!
- It's not our side.

798
00:58:36,109 --> 00:58:37,917
It's not?!
Then stop clapping.

799
00:58:40,768 --> 00:58:44,329
Candidate No. 4 Jo Pilyeon
is currently hospitalized,

800
00:58:44,482 --> 00:58:46,598
<i>so he could not participate today.</i>

801
00:58:46,739 --> 00:58:52,583
He shouldn't have missed
the very last session...

802
00:58:52,710 --> 00:58:55,858
He barely made it out of
there alive, could he come here?

803
00:58:55,975 --> 00:58:59,179
No matter how much better
his approval rate has gotten,

804
00:58:59,408 --> 00:59:04,375
if you miss a day like this,
the consequences will be serious.

805
00:59:08,791 --> 00:59:10,131
<i>Excuse me.</i>

806
00:59:10,225 --> 00:59:12,142
<i>Excuse me.</i>

807
01:00:09,550 --> 01:00:15,282
I, Candidate No. 4 Jo Pilyeon!

808
01:00:15,835 --> 01:00:19,879
Am standing here before you again!

809
01:00:37,224 --> 01:00:43,908
And what gave me the strength
to get back up on my feet...

810
01:00:44,954 --> 01:00:48,431
was what I most love and respect,

811
01:00:48,610 --> 01:00:51,466
my people!

812
01:00:57,886 --> 01:01:01,063
Jo Pilyeon! Jo Pilyeon!

813
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:04,225
<i>The people's choice, Jo Pilyeon!</i>

814
01:01:04,328 --> 01:01:07,387
Jo Pilyeon! Jo Pilyeon!

815
01:01:07,528 --> 01:01:10,514
The people's choice, Jo Pilyeon!

816
01:01:10,632 --> 01:01:13,498
Jo Pilyeon! Jo Pilyeon!

817
01:01:34,657 --> 01:01:36,127
- So hardener would do the trick.
- Yes.

818
01:01:36,197 --> 01:01:40,582
It was already used for bricks,
so I tried to adapt it to the situation.

819
01:01:40,982 --> 01:01:42,361
Well done.

820
01:01:42,453 --> 01:01:43,627
Yes.

821
01:01:45,470 --> 01:01:46,410
Chief.

822
01:01:46,508 --> 01:01:48,209
I made a few calculations,

823
01:01:48,327 --> 01:01:52,654
and we could reduce costs 
by at least forty percent.

824
01:01:52,761 --> 01:01:54,075
File a patent request.

825
01:01:54,205 --> 01:01:55,557
The quicker, the better.

826
01:01:55,709 --> 01:01:57,904
Yes.
I'll get right to it.

827
01:02:00,854 --> 01:02:05,110
<i>- Hangang Construction -

Our R&D team found a solution to
our highway construction problems.

829
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:26,286
We wouldn't use sand and gravel,
but take advantage of the existing mud...

830
01:02:26,394 --> 01:02:30,498
You really are more
dull-witted than I thought.

831
01:02:30,811 --> 01:02:33,542

information is crucial?

Read it out.

833
01:02:45,854 --> 01:02:48,123
If we don't join forces with
Hangang Construction right away,

834
01:02:48,205 --> 01:02:50,828
we'll be weeded out of business.

835
01:03:03,061 --> 01:03:04,881

836

Ahh... Come on, let's do it right!

Just go, all right?

01:03:40,888 --> 01:03:42,800
- I apologize.
- If you are, then stand in line.

Can't you even get that right?

848
01:03:58,580 --> 01:04:00,838
- Then...
- See you again.

849
01:04:05,539 --> 01:04:06,997
