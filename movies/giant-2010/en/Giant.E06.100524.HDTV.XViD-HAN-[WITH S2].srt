00:00:35,051 --> 00:00:36,524
Hello?

6
00:00:36,812 --> 00:00:39,303
It's me. Director Hwang.

7
00:00:39,531 --> 00:00:41,607
Director?! Yeah, right...

8
00:00:41,894 --> 00:00:44,836
So, do we have the results?

9
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:47,560
What?

10
00:00:48,818 --> 00:00:51,378
You still need three days?

11
00:00:52,746 --> 00:00:56,087
In your opinion, 
what is the most likely result?

12
00:00:56,715 --> 00:00:59,734
Is briquette ash worth looking into?

13
00:00:59,914 --> 00:01:01,507
Well...

14
00:01:02,202 --> 00:01:04,023
Until the results come out,

15
00:01:04,142 --> 00:01:07,212
I couldn't really say with certainty.

16
00:01:07,397 --> 00:01:08,189
I see.

17
00:01:08,309 --> 00:01:11,813
Anyhow, I'll be waiting for good news.

18
00:01:11,907 --> 00:01:13,364
<i>Yes.</i>

19
00:01:15,416 --> 00:01:18,516
They sure enjoy 
playing with people's nerves.

20
00:01:18,635 --> 00:01:20,217
I can go now, right?

21
00:01:20,396 --> 00:01:21,764
Wait a moment.

22
00:01:21,908 --> 00:01:24,016
Run an errand for me.

23
00:01:24,124 --> 00:01:25,086
Uh?!

24
00:01:25,184 --> 00:01:27,179
I need to go to work.

25
00:01:27,502 --> 00:01:29,167
It will only take a moment.

26
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:30,514
Forget it.

27
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:34,761
They're about to kick me
out of the tent, because of you.

28
00:01:44,837 --> 00:01:46,284
<i>What's the matter?</i>

29
00:01:47,738 --> 00:01:51,177
I'm here to meet Major Jo Pilyeon.

30
00:01:51,968 --> 00:01:53,729
Do you have an appointment?

31
00:01:54,016 --> 00:01:54,881
No.

32
00:01:54,991 --> 00:01:56,101
I came on behalf of someone.

33
00:01:56,221 --> 00:01:58,207
No civilians are allowed inside.

34
00:01:58,365 --> 00:01:59,892
Wait.

35
00:02:00,198 --> 00:02:01,572
I'll just go in a minute.

36
00:02:01,692 --> 00:02:05,382
All I need is to convey something 
to Major Jo Pilyeon.

37
00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:09,047
Thanks.

38
00:02:13,396 --> 00:02:14,636
Is this all I need to give him?

39
00:02:14,724 --> 00:02:16,156
Yes.

40
00:02:39,302 --> 00:02:40,962
Did you find out?

41
00:02:41,767 --> 00:02:42,860
Yes.

42
00:02:43,219 --> 00:02:44,693
The file's name?

43
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,545
The name of the file where
that document is being kept.

44
00:02:51,699 --> 00:02:54,408
K-19.

45
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:00,844
It's in the document storage, section F.

46
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:10,454
Is Hampton in his office now?

47
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,060
Yes.

48
00:03:14,566 --> 00:03:19,559
From here on in, 
only take care of laundry work.

49
00:03:19,787 --> 00:03:25,565
You can't do anything that could
attract Hampton's suspicion.

50
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:29,145
Yes, Sir.

51
00:03:46,781 --> 00:03:49,146
To prove our wish to bury the hatchet.

52
00:03:49,325 --> 00:03:53,331
You're not going to grow
suspicions again, I hope?

53
00:03:53,482 --> 00:03:55,547
I'll accept it gladly.

54
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:59,378
Considering the awkward position 
this accident put us into,

55
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:04,848
how about we organize a concert
for our troops, to strengthen our ties?

56
00:04:05,732 --> 00:04:07,656
Sounds like fun.

57
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:12,983
We will take care of organizing it, then.

58
00:04:14,013 --> 00:04:17,712
Would this Friday be fine with you?

59
00:04:17,871 --> 00:04:19,222
All right.

60
00:04:19,401 --> 00:04:24,301
Then, I will see you at the concert.

61
00:04:48,216 --> 00:04:50,668
This Friday's D-day.

62
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:55,308
It's the document storage, section F.
File name K-19.

63
00:04:56,572 --> 00:05:01,837
The concert will distract them.
We will steal the document that day.

64
00:05:02,005 --> 00:05:03,658
Yes, Sir.

65
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,357
Major.

66
00:05:07,664 --> 00:05:10,235
A certain Hwang Taeseop sent this.

67
00:05:18,263 --> 00:05:22,023
What kind of mess is he making?

68
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:27,906
Stop! Stop there!

69
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,296
You little runts...

70
00:05:29,368 --> 00:05:33,945
Elders always come first, 
you little runts.

71
00:05:34,031 --> 00:05:35,435
Just wait.

72
00:05:49,462 --> 00:05:51,678
It's ready.
Let's eat.

73
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,055
Is there any rice?

74
00:06:02,283 --> 00:06:06,032
Can you really live off of
potatoes alone day and night?

75
00:06:06,164 --> 00:06:08,812
Pay for the rice and then talk.

76
00:06:08,979 --> 00:06:09,997
Even freeloaders have
the balls to complain...

77
00:06:10,129 --> 00:06:12,500
What? Listen.

78
00:06:12,599 --> 00:06:14,984
Who should you thank for
staying afloat all this time?

79
00:06:15,078 --> 00:06:19,092
That tent of yours, 
it's all on Manbo Construction's land.

80
00:06:19,182 --> 00:06:20,585
You went belly up.

81
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,400
I'm still here alive and well,
who went belly up?

82
00:06:23,496 --> 00:06:26,599
Do you know how many creditors are 
prancing all over the place all day?

83
00:06:26,743 --> 00:06:32,527
You runts! 
Let me make myself perfectly clear.

84
00:06:32,634 --> 00:06:35,821
If you want to continue
doing business there later,

85
00:06:35,965 --> 00:06:37,546
you better treat me well now.

86
00:06:37,678 --> 00:06:38,337
Are we square?

87
00:06:38,444 --> 00:06:39,894
Yes!

88
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:43,267
Aren't you going to work?

89
00:06:44,633 --> 00:06:48,057
Ahh... Little runt,
he's got guts for sure.

90
00:06:52,395 --> 00:06:54,288
Just my luck...

91
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,941
Ahh... I've really had it with him.

92
00:06:57,097 --> 00:06:58,463
Hey.

93
00:06:58,858 --> 00:07:00,799
Give me another pair of socks,
if you still have one.

94
00:07:01,506 --> 00:07:04,548
Take a look at this.
Aigoo!

95
00:07:04,656 --> 00:07:07,040
Got a hole, again.

96
00:07:07,256 --> 00:07:08,992
Been wearing these a few days,

97
00:07:09,086 --> 00:07:10,834
and they already smell sour.

98
00:07:10,926 --> 00:07:13,113
Give me a new pair.

99
00:07:14,826 --> 00:07:16,498
Ohh... right.

100
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:24,331
What are you doing?

101
00:07:24,417 --> 00:07:28,436
Ajeosshi.
Nothing here is free.

102
00:07:28,855 --> 00:07:32,578
I'll write everything down to
the last penny, just so you know.

103
00:07:32,717 --> 00:07:34,621
You nasty little runt...

104
00:07:34,713 --> 00:07:38,344
You told the other kids to
keep their mouths shut, didn't you?

105
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,745
Don't worry.

106
00:07:39,853 --> 00:07:44,283
Nobody can learn I'm hiding here.
Are we clear?

107
00:07:44,373 --> 00:07:45,946
I said I got it.

108
00:07:46,023 --> 00:07:47,280
<i>Ahh!</i>

109
00:07:47,382 --> 00:07:48,428
Also,

110
00:07:48,525 --> 00:07:51,342
if anything happens,
report back to me immediately.

111
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:52,898
All right?

112
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,957
It won't take long, you fool.

113
00:08:05,543 --> 00:08:07,868
If I can only get
the results I'm expecting,

114
00:08:08,167 --> 00:08:10,264
I'll get back on my feet.

115
00:08:10,575 --> 00:08:11,869
I will.

116
00:08:20,483 --> 00:08:25,715
<i>You can try to hide Director Hwang
all you want, but nothing will change.</i>

117
00:08:26,242 --> 00:08:29,549
Didn't I tell you we don't
know where he is, either?

118
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,904
Tell him this when you see him.

119
00:08:35,383 --> 00:08:37,779
<i>That at tomorrow's
committee meeting at City Hall,</i>

120
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:42,728
the Banpo landfill contract
will be transferred to us.

121
00:08:44,243 --> 00:08:49,331
If Director Hwang participates, 
he will be refunded all the money spent so far,

122
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,524
but should he fail to do so,

123
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:58,988
he will have to give that up as well.

124
00:09:07,731 --> 00:09:09,612
To at least get back enough to go by,

125
00:09:09,732 --> 00:09:12,679
shouldn't his family
show up at the meeting?

126
00:09:13,146 --> 00:09:18,058
Seems like the director took
both the seal and the contract.

127
00:09:18,237 --> 00:09:21,776
<i>If this keeps up, we'll end up in ruins.</i>

128
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,688
<i>You know Manbo Construction's 
director, right?</i>

129
00:09:29,192 --> 00:09:32,702
The moment Director Hwang
shows up, call me immediately.

130
00:09:33,013 --> 00:09:35,554
I'll give you 20,000 won 
for the trouble.

131
00:09:35,914 --> 00:09:36,800
What?

132
00:09:37,018 --> 00:09:38,377
2...20,000?!

133
00:09:38,488 --> 00:09:42,011
I'm not the kind of man who would
deceive you, so give me a call.

134
00:09:43,233 --> 00:09:44,789
<i>Keep the change.</i>

135
00:09:45,965 --> 00:09:47,414
Sir.

136
00:09:50,451 --> 00:09:53,314
What I was saying is...
Director Hwang...

137
00:09:53,422 --> 00:09:56,057
If we see him, we'll give you a call.

138
00:09:57,092 --> 00:09:59,459
All right, then.
Will be counting on you.

139
00:10:00,118 --> 00:10:02,252
Have a nice day.

140
00:10:02,409 --> 00:10:03,941
Have a nice day.

141
00:10:04,109 --> 00:10:08,756
Have you heard? If we report 
Director Hwang, we'll get 20,000 won!

142
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:10,291
So?

143
00:10:10,492 --> 00:10:13,897
You fool. Is 20,000 won
your dog's middle name?

144
00:10:14,003 --> 00:10:17,040
Unless you want to
break our partnership,

145
00:10:17,154 --> 00:10:18,582
you better stay put.

146
00:10:18,726 --> 00:10:20,680
He's nothing but a beggar now!

147
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,464
How much longer are you going
to keep feeding and sheltering him?

148
00:10:22,547 --> 00:10:24,117
I said enough!

149
00:10:25,311 --> 00:10:27,040
Is it because of that brat?

150
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:28,968
Director Hwang's daughter?

151
00:10:29,505 --> 00:10:31,100
Wake up, will you?

152
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:35,005
Think she cares even the
slightest bit about you?

153
00:10:35,094 --> 00:10:36,539
She's just...

154
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:38,384
I said enough, didn't I?

155
00:10:38,515 --> 00:10:41,225
What's wrong with you?

156
00:10:41,316 --> 00:10:43,065
Don't try anything funny,

157
00:10:43,248 --> 00:10:45,393
or you'll pay for it.

158
00:10:48,915 --> 00:10:51,551
Ahh... That blockhead.

159
00:10:55,725 --> 00:10:56,623
What?

160
00:10:56,743 --> 00:10:57,929
Hong Gipyo?

161
00:10:58,073 --> 00:11:00,229
Yes. He said that if you
don't show up at the meeting,

162
00:11:00,313 --> 00:11:02,690
your investment won't be reimbursed.

163
00:11:04,613 --> 00:11:06,782
He's just bluffing.

164
00:11:06,978 --> 00:11:11,447
Without me, he can't do a thing.
I already took care of that.

165
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:14,323
Hand me a few coins, will you?

166
00:11:14,469 --> 00:11:15,317
What?

167
00:11:15,712 --> 00:11:16,623
What for, again?

168
00:11:16,694 --> 00:11:19,198
- Just give it to me.
- So you can drink it all away?

169
00:11:19,318 --> 00:11:22,640
Keep talking back every
chance you get, will you?

170
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:34,844
Add it to my tab.

171
00:11:46,452 --> 00:11:49,293
The major is waiting.

172
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,420
It's so hot...

173
00:12:05,612 --> 00:12:10,320
As you asked, I pushed to
postpone the meeting a few days.

174
00:12:10,715 --> 00:12:12,296
Thank you.

175
00:12:12,464 --> 00:12:17,226
Actually, I tried 
not to get to this point.

176
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:19,226
Did the results come out?

177
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:22,628
Yes... They said it will
take another few days.

178
00:12:22,748 --> 00:12:25,495
So why didn't you listen to me, and...

179
00:12:28,927 --> 00:12:33,695
Anyhow, do everything it takes 
to keep your company afloat.

180
00:12:33,827 --> 00:12:37,300
When you're back on your feet, 
let's talk again.

181
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:47,951
If I can only save my company, then...

182
00:12:48,317 --> 00:12:53,118
you won't ever order me
around like a mutt again.

183
00:12:58,055 --> 00:12:59,632
Aww... Nice.

184
00:12:59,782 --> 00:13:01,611
Tastes just right.

185
00:13:08,182 --> 00:13:09,519
Hey.

186
00:13:12,286 --> 00:13:14,491
The office is empty.

187
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:15,648
Dad...

188
00:14:15,979 --> 00:14:18,507
You didn't die, right?

189
00:14:19,753 --> 00:14:22,335
Where on earth are you?

190
00:14:22,952 --> 00:14:25,068
<i>Don't worry.</i>

191
00:14:27,228 --> 00:14:29,050
Your father is safe.

192
00:14:29,194 --> 00:14:31,829
You know where he is, right?

193
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,501
You do, right?

194
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,112
Where is he? Where?

195
00:14:37,237 --> 00:14:38,909
Don't know.

196
00:14:44,604 --> 00:14:45,395
Here.

197
00:14:45,527 --> 00:14:47,312
Get home with this.

198
00:14:47,731 --> 00:14:50,055
What are you doing?

199
00:14:50,462 --> 00:14:52,271
Think I'm a beggar or something?

200
00:14:52,445 --> 00:14:55,573
You walked your way here.

201
00:14:56,293 --> 00:14:58,401
I grabbed a taxi.

202
00:14:58,892 --> 00:15:02,744
So you "grabbed a taxi," 
and your shoes are in that state?

203
00:15:07,685 --> 00:15:09,626
No need for that money.

204
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:13,160
Since I won't go home
until my father shows up.

205
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:38,736
<i>By 6, the library will close its doors.</i>

206
00:15:39,359 --> 00:15:42,857
<i>Hide somewhere inside,
and once everyone has left,</i>

207
00:15:42,952 --> 00:15:45,324
<i>infiltrate the document storage room.</i>

208
00:15:46,714 --> 00:15:48,224
<i>Remember.</i>

209
00:15:48,476 --> 00:15:52,142
<i>Section F, file name K-19.</i>

210
00:16:12,132 --> 00:16:15,093
Jo's guy showed up at the library.

211
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:17,285
As expected.

212
00:16:18,267 --> 00:16:20,928
Well, Sir.
Time to go.

213
00:16:21,142 --> 00:16:23,642
Show's about to begin.

214
00:16:58,358 --> 00:16:59,687
Welcome.

215
00:16:59,835 --> 00:17:01,128
The show just started.

216
00:17:01,248 --> 00:17:04,876
Yeah, looks like the soldiers are
having a really good time here tonight.

217
00:17:04,987 --> 00:17:07,868
Hope you'll enjoy it as well.

218
00:17:08,167 --> 00:17:11,582
Thanks for putting this
special event on, Major Jo.

219
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:21,148
- Hey, I'm gonna go watch the show.
- Okay.

220
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,818
<i>Thank you!</i>

221
00:19:45,632 --> 00:19:47,277
Where are you going?

222
00:19:47,732 --> 00:19:52,265
I have a phone call,
from my family back in the States.

223
00:19:53,043 --> 00:19:55,002
But I'll be right back.

224
00:20:12,418 --> 00:20:13,166
Freeze!

225
00:20:13,226 --> 00:20:14,960
Drop it!

226
00:20:21,154 --> 00:20:24,413
You're under arrest for espionage.

227
00:20:31,236 --> 00:20:33,596
This is not the document.

228
00:20:38,364 --> 00:20:40,747
I fell asleep inside.

229
00:20:41,322 --> 00:20:45,854
Is borrowing books from
the library considered espionage?

230
00:21:00,373 --> 00:21:01,258
Where's Major Jo?

231
00:21:01,342 --> 00:21:03,139
Sir, he left right after you.

232
00:21:03,211 --> 00:21:05,201
Can't see the laundry boy anywhere.

233
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:07,368
Did you see the laundry boy?
Where did he go?

234
00:21:07,451 --> 00:21:11,105
He left. He said he'd 
run some errands for you.

235
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:22,814
Call his house, immediately!

236
00:21:39,516 --> 00:21:42,567
<i>He's the orderly of General Hampton.</i>

237
00:21:43,966 --> 00:21:46,191
Open the gates.

238
00:21:57,523 --> 00:22:00,276
I don't even know what I'm doing.

239
00:22:01,158 --> 00:22:03,827
Why did I get involved with Jo Pilyeon...

240
00:22:04,457 --> 00:22:05,875
Let's just forget it.

241
00:22:06,031 --> 00:22:09,194
He promised you'd be
discharged today, instead.

242
00:22:09,302 --> 00:22:12,500
I can forget about
going to the States, now.

243
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:31,743
I'll search here,
so you check the living room.

244
00:23:48,603 --> 00:23:50,364
I told you we shouldn't have done this.

245
00:23:50,436 --> 00:23:52,125
Past that corner, 
a taxi will be waiting for us.

246
00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:55,791
I'll just take that, 
and head back home in Daejeon, so...

247
00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:07,125
Hyung!

248
00:24:24,005 --> 00:24:26,494
Dammit...

249
00:24:26,722 --> 00:24:31,490
I knew it... when I saw 
my mother in my dreams.

250
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,574
Don't even say that.

251
00:24:33,706 --> 00:24:35,731
I'm a doctor.

252
00:24:36,522 --> 00:24:37,671
There's no hope.

253
00:24:37,791 --> 00:24:41,840
Hyung... I'm not leaving without you.

254
00:24:43,289 --> 00:24:45,398
<i>Leave, now!</i>

255
00:24:45,506 --> 00:24:50,250
You need to find your family.

256
00:24:50,813 --> 00:25:01,076
They'll bury me in the state
cemetery like my father, right?

257
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:05,823
Hyung...

258
00:25:06,693 --> 00:25:08,171
<i>Hyung!</i>

259
00:25:09,612 --> 00:25:11,406
Hyung!

260
00:25:31,771 --> 00:25:33,199
What?

261
00:25:33,364 --> 00:25:35,017
He got away?!

262
00:25:35,511 --> 00:25:38,060
I want a thorough search of the area.

263
00:25:38,575 --> 00:25:41,246
I want him found!

264
00:25:50,109 --> 00:25:52,734
Major... there!

265
00:26:07,071 --> 00:26:08,581
The document?

266
00:26:19,438 --> 00:26:21,336
The doctor...

267
00:26:22,295 --> 00:26:24,379
is dead.

268
00:26:28,225 --> 00:26:29,867
Good job.

269
00:26:30,095 --> 00:26:31,699
<i>You saved me.</i>

270
00:26:31,794 --> 00:26:33,869
You saved this country.

271
00:26:37,892 --> 00:26:40,604
I said the doctor is dead!

272
00:26:43,191 --> 00:26:44,976
The doctor...

273
00:26:45,237 --> 00:26:47,408
is dead!

274
00:26:48,678 --> 00:26:52,367
And what a relief you aren't.

275
00:26:54,894 --> 00:26:56,372
Everyone dies.

276
00:26:56,467 --> 00:26:58,911
It's just a matter of how and when.

277
00:26:59,127 --> 00:27:02,790
<i>With this in our hands,
he didn't die in vain.</i>

278
00:27:03,907 --> 00:27:06,874
Let's meet again here tomorrow.

279
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:10,444
For the time being,
you'll live at my house.

280
00:27:25,252 --> 00:27:28,005
You son of a bitch!

281
00:27:29,541 --> 00:27:31,299
Bring him back.

282
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,790
Bring back my father as well...

283
00:27:35,377 --> 00:27:37,306
And all the rest of them!

284
00:27:37,929 --> 00:27:40,828
Bring them back!

285
00:27:56,499 --> 00:27:58,416
<i>Tomorrow we will act.</i>

286
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:01,451
If we manage to complete this task,

287
00:28:01,918 --> 00:28:04,386
I'll be accepted into the KCIA.

288
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:08,064
Do you realize what kind of
place we're dealing with?

289
00:28:08,986 --> 00:28:11,634
It's a small country within our country.

290
00:28:12,041 --> 00:28:14,658
The very core of this country's power.

291
00:28:20,313 --> 00:28:24,410
Want to work with me there?

292
00:28:25,363 --> 00:28:26,953
You're still too young to understand,

293
00:28:27,049 --> 00:28:29,565
how having so much power
can change your life.

294
00:28:30,152 --> 00:28:35,473
I have this country's top brass
backing me on this task.

295
00:28:35,583 --> 00:28:40,607
Even if I fail, 
nobody inside this country can kill me.

296
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:43,988
<i>Be it the Americans or Hampton.</i>

297
00:28:45,986 --> 00:28:49,735
That's what power means.

298
00:28:52,364 --> 00:28:56,434
I told you everything I had to say,
so you may go.

299
00:29:02,528 --> 00:29:06,309
Is there anything you want to tell me?

300
00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:13,495
It's a trap, again.

301
00:29:15,579 --> 00:29:16,717
What?!

302
00:29:17,012 --> 00:29:22,188
I just overheard what Hampton said.

303
00:29:22,987 --> 00:29:26,237
What they're keeping in
the storage room is a fake.

304
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:30,681
The real one...

305
00:29:33,363 --> 00:29:36,334
is inside Captain Michael's quarters.

306
00:29:59,522 --> 00:30:01,308
Fine...

307
00:30:02,099 --> 00:30:04,998
I'll follow you to the pits of hell.

308
00:30:08,169 --> 00:30:11,347
I'll find that other man
responsible for my father's death,

309
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:18,551
and kill the both of you
with my own hands.

310
00:30:39,933 --> 00:30:41,791
Student.

311
00:30:42,139 --> 00:30:46,415
S-t-u-d-e...

312
00:30:49,114 --> 00:30:50,980
n-t.

313
00:30:52,493 --> 00:30:53,127
Student.

314
00:30:53,235 --> 00:30:54,708
Ahh... Really...

315
00:30:54,828 --> 00:30:58,709
Can't close a damned eye in here.

316
00:31:01,517 --> 00:31:03,142
What are you doing?

317
00:31:05,358 --> 00:31:07,173
Are you studying?

318
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,709
Just sleep.

319
00:31:10,713 --> 00:31:13,378
What are you trying to accomplish?

320
00:31:14,324 --> 00:31:18,507
Just go on shining shoes.
As if studying suited you...

321
00:31:35,109 --> 00:31:37,709
What is he studying?

322
00:31:40,235 --> 00:31:42,237
English.

323
00:31:49,745 --> 00:31:52,860
Aigoo...
He sure doesn't give up...

324
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:56,142
Seems like nothing can bring him down.

325
00:32:29,544 --> 00:32:31,903
Are you really not going home?

326
00:32:35,361 --> 00:32:37,317
Why are you here?

327
00:32:49,228 --> 00:32:51,134
I don't like bean jam pancakes.

328
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:53,943
You didn't even have dinner.

329
00:32:54,054 --> 00:32:57,281
I've had so much to eat
I can't take it anymore.

330
00:33:00,281 --> 00:33:03,498
Eat it or leave it, do as you wish.

331
00:33:03,702 --> 00:33:04,672
Why are you lying there?

332
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:07,328
I won't find anywhere to
sleep under the bridge.

333
00:33:07,435 --> 00:33:10,259
<i>{\a6}*Confucian tenet: After the age of seven,
men & women shouldn't even share the same room</i>

334
00:33:07,435 --> 00:33:10,259
Hey... Don't you know
about gender separation*?

335
00:33:10,403 --> 00:33:13,252
Why would friends worry about gender?

336
00:33:18,089 --> 00:33:19,598
Lee Gangmo.

337
00:33:20,005 --> 00:33:22,066
Do you like me or something?

338
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,796
Why, you think you're that pretty?

339
00:33:31,641 --> 00:33:34,253
I only like girls with a pretty face.

340
00:33:34,792 --> 00:33:36,145
You little...

341
00:33:36,253 --> 00:33:39,023
You... Get out! Leave!

342
00:34:23,891 --> 00:34:25,797
Mommy!

343
00:34:46,057 --> 00:34:48,460
Seems like it's a black-out.

344
00:35:07,704 --> 00:35:09,525
Doesn't work?!

345
00:35:10,472 --> 00:35:13,275
You can sleep without lights on, right?

346
00:35:15,298 --> 00:35:16,425
I'll go.

347
00:35:16,557 --> 00:35:18,210
Good night.

348
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:32,718
You said there's nowhere to sleep.

349
00:35:33,844 --> 00:35:35,378
I'll be kind, for once.

350
00:35:35,545 --> 00:35:37,210
Sleep here.

351
00:36:27,775 --> 00:36:30,087
Am I seeing right?!

352
00:36:32,235 --> 00:36:34,448
<i>Why does she look so pretty?</i>

353
00:36:37,895 --> 00:36:39,308
Nah... No.

354
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:41,249
Must be the hunger.

355
00:36:41,345 --> 00:36:43,489
It's that for sure.

356
00:37:13,719 --> 00:37:15,117
Ajeosshi.

357
00:37:15,227 --> 00:37:16,711
Get up, will you?

358
00:37:16,787 --> 00:37:18,634
Wake up!

359
00:37:19,748 --> 00:37:25,197
Why do I have to hear a kiddo like you 
scream in my face at this hour?

360
00:37:25,308 --> 00:37:27,176
Where did my money go?

361
00:37:27,818 --> 00:37:28,625
What?

362
00:37:28,745 --> 00:37:32,210
Where did all the money I put here go?!

363
00:37:33,515 --> 00:37:36,336
And why are you asking me that?

364
00:37:36,431 --> 00:37:39,553
Is there anyone else
who could have stolen it?

365
00:37:39,637 --> 00:37:42,420
You little runt, point fingers
at innocent people, will you?!

366
00:37:42,518 --> 00:37:45,810
You fool. Do I look like
I'd need your petty few pennies?

367
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,044
You'd be more than capable!

368
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,524
You little runt, I ought to just...

369
00:37:50,162 --> 00:37:53,527
Treat me like a thief again,

370
00:37:53,634 --> 00:37:55,118
and I'll just tear that trap...

371
00:37:55,478 --> 00:37:57,980
Got it?
Leave!

372
00:37:59,946 --> 00:38:02,749
Aww... I really can't stand him!

373
00:38:07,728 --> 00:38:10,052
This is all because of you!

374
00:38:13,174 --> 00:38:14,959
What's wrong with him?

375
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:28,050
Those runts stuffed themselves
enough not to leave a grain of rice?!

376
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,548
So you really didn't steal that money?

377
00:38:31,692 --> 00:38:37,370
If I laid my hands 
on that money, I'm your son.

378
00:38:37,478 --> 00:38:39,130
Happy now?

379
00:38:41,215 --> 00:38:44,629
Today the results will come out.

380
00:38:45,017 --> 00:38:51,870
Whatever happens,
this is my last day here.

381
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:54,013
I'm so hungry I could die.

382
00:38:54,987 --> 00:38:58,353
Go buy something to eat.

383
00:39:12,513 --> 00:39:15,866
I won't steal your money.

384
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:23,404
It's just that I have to
go to the research center...

385
00:39:25,656 --> 00:39:28,411
Lots of work to do.

386
00:39:37,551 --> 00:39:38,826
Hello?

387
00:39:39,159 --> 00:39:42,450
Daeryuk Construction's
Director Hong, right?

388
00:39:43,152 --> 00:39:46,511
I found out where Director
Hwang Taeseop is staying.

389
00:39:46,655 --> 00:39:49,374
Look... Look at this.

390
00:39:53,911 --> 00:39:59,336
What's the occasion?
Even buying me broth.

391
00:39:59,587 --> 00:40:02,355
You know that it's not free.

392
00:40:05,822 --> 00:40:10,498
Everyone says I'm ruined,

393
00:40:10,806 --> 00:40:12,978
but what if you can't
get your money back?

394
00:40:13,386 --> 00:40:15,446
You're not going to get ruined.

395
00:40:16,955 --> 00:40:18,357
And how do you know that?

396
00:40:18,704 --> 00:40:22,588
Is there anything better
than briquette ash to harden soil?

397
00:40:23,367 --> 00:40:25,729
You take over research, then.

398
00:40:33,919 --> 00:40:35,806
Who are you?

399
00:40:43,678 --> 00:40:44,822
Hong?!

400
00:40:44,966 --> 00:40:46,272
And what are you doing here?

401
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:49,827
You're still the man
running Manbo Construction...

402
00:40:49,932 --> 00:40:52,040
How could you subject people to this?

403
00:40:52,339 --> 00:40:53,873
Follow me.

404
00:40:54,364 --> 00:40:56,808
Everyone is waiting at City Hall.

405
00:40:56,999 --> 00:40:58,700
Ajeosshi.

406
00:40:58,856 --> 00:41:00,162
<i>What are you doing? Let go!</i>

407
00:41:00,282 --> 00:41:01,755
Let go... I said let go!

408
00:41:01,887 --> 00:41:04,254
You must put your seal 
on those documents!

409
00:41:04,386 --> 00:41:06,230
What are you waiting for? 
Help him out.

410
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:07,596
Let... Let me go!

411
00:41:07,704 --> 00:41:10,986
You fools... How dare you!

412
00:41:11,142 --> 00:41:14,844
<i>Let go! I said let go!</i>

413
00:41:25,433 --> 00:41:27,246
They took the director with them.

414
00:41:27,342 --> 00:41:28,512
<i>What?</i>

415
00:41:29,681 --> 00:41:30,612
What is that supposed to mean?

416
00:41:30,708 --> 00:41:32,505
Come with me somewhere.

417
00:41:32,625 --> 00:41:33,931
We have no time to waste, quick!

418
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:35,516
Where's my father?

419
00:41:35,612 --> 00:41:39,794
Head to City Hall right away.
Go, and tell your father not to sign.

420
00:41:39,934 --> 00:41:41,274
What are you saying?

421
00:41:41,366 --> 00:41:43,103
I'll explain everything later.

422
00:41:43,207 --> 00:41:45,593
Anyhow, tell him to just buy time.

423
00:41:45,714 --> 00:41:46,852
Got it?

424
00:41:46,972 --> 00:41:49,056
We have no time left,
let's go, Ajeosshi.

425
00:41:49,164 --> 00:41:50,326
All right.

426
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:52,933
- Take Jeongyeon to City Hall.
- Yes.

427
00:42:01,283 --> 00:42:04,709
We will soon begin the audit.

428
00:42:05,304 --> 00:42:07,441
As not all the required
documents are ready,

429
00:42:07,551 --> 00:42:14,082
we're forced to move the transfer
of Manbo Construction's Banpo lot...

430
00:42:14,286 --> 00:42:15,989
to after the audit.

431
00:42:16,553 --> 00:42:18,467
We can solve that right away!

432
00:42:18,622 --> 00:42:19,772
I said let me go!

433
00:42:19,916 --> 00:42:21,857
Let go!

434
00:42:22,954 --> 00:42:24,248
Let me go.

435
00:42:24,379 --> 00:42:25,481
Let go!

436
00:42:25,745 --> 00:42:27,302
I ought to...

437
00:42:29,142 --> 00:42:31,423
I'm glad you came on time.

438
00:42:33,903 --> 00:42:35,209
Here.

439
00:42:37,278 --> 00:42:39,053
If you don't have your seal with you,

440
00:42:39,132 --> 00:42:41,178
your fingerprint would do.

441
00:42:45,084 --> 00:42:46,917
Go ahead.

442
00:42:47,719 --> 00:42:52,129
I solved the landfill issue.

443
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:54,933
So you're telling me
you found enough sand?

444
00:42:56,309 --> 00:42:57,520
Yes.

445
00:42:59,476 --> 00:43:00,863
He's just lying.

446
00:43:00,994 --> 00:43:04,273
With his company filing for bankruptcy,
what money could he have?

447
00:43:04,393 --> 00:43:10,527
I found another material to use 
instead of construction sand.

448
00:43:11,464 --> 00:43:13,462
<i>That makes no sense!</i>

449
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:18,537
And what on earth are you going to use?

450
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,561
Go ahead and say it.

451
00:43:20,993 --> 00:43:24,970
What is this replacement
material you're suggesting?

452
00:43:26,827 --> 00:43:30,161
It's... briquette ash.

453
00:43:32,678 --> 00:43:33,888
Briquette ash?!

454
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:35,170
Yes.

455
00:43:35,554 --> 00:43:42,395
We can use the same briquette ash 
you see piling up in every dump.

456
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:48,137
<i>Briquette ash?!</i>

457
00:43:48,528 --> 00:43:51,235
<i>Listen to that nonsense...</i>

458
00:43:56,081 --> 00:43:58,562
And Director Hwang Taeseop?

459
00:43:58,657 --> 00:44:00,961
He was busy, so we came instead.

460
00:44:01,081 --> 00:44:02,722
How about the results of your research?

461
00:44:02,877 --> 00:44:05,513
Who are you, to ask me that?

462
00:44:05,868 --> 00:44:06,807
I...

463
00:44:06,903 --> 00:44:10,945
He was the one who brought up 
the idea of using briquette ash.

464
00:44:12,759 --> 00:44:13,932
You?!

465
00:44:14,134 --> 00:44:17,910
Yes... I told the director.

466
00:44:19,807 --> 00:44:21,972
So we can use it to fill that land, right?

467
00:44:22,128 --> 00:44:22,883
Right?

468
00:44:22,979 --> 00:44:27,243
You could fill land with whatever you want.

469
00:44:27,435 --> 00:44:31,496
The issue is whether you can build over it.

470
00:44:33,784 --> 00:44:36,172
If we can only get past this hurdle,

471
00:44:36,281 --> 00:44:40,839
then we won't have to worry about 
construction sand ever again.

472
00:44:40,948 --> 00:44:44,848
Also, since we can even deal with
waste disposal at the same time,

473
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:48,669
how beneficial would this be 
to the entire country?!

474
00:44:49,624 --> 00:44:51,553
Listen, Director Hwang.

475
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:53,757
I can understand how
difficult your situation is,

476
00:44:53,877 --> 00:44:56,201
but can an entrepreneur
sell his dignity for this?

477
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,411
Sell my dignity?!

478
00:44:57,530 --> 00:45:00,142
I mean, what if you build
housing over briquette ash,

479
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,315
and then the whole thing collapses?

480
00:45:02,447 --> 00:45:05,358
How are you going to deal with 
all those casualties?

481
00:45:05,538 --> 00:45:09,905
That is why I told you the result of 
that research will be published today!

482
00:45:10,003 --> 00:45:13,408
I think it would be foolish 
to go on with this farce.

483
00:45:13,564 --> 00:45:15,665
Have him sign.

484
00:45:15,809 --> 00:45:19,706
By now, the results should be out.

485
00:45:19,812 --> 00:45:23,344
If it truly has no efficacy,

486
00:45:25,704 --> 00:45:28,962
then I'll give everything up,
and sign that document.

487
00:45:29,106 --> 00:45:31,250
<i>All the people gathered here 
have busy schedules.</i>

488
00:45:31,358 --> 00:45:34,101
Make some sense, will you?

489
00:45:34,389 --> 00:45:38,379
I can find out with a single phone call.

490
00:45:45,357 --> 00:45:47,154
Go ahead, then.

491
00:46:16,005 --> 00:46:17,328
Hello?

492
00:46:17,627 --> 00:46:20,407
It's the Geological
Research Center, right?

493
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:23,008
Is the chief in?

494
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:25,368
What?

495
00:46:25,723 --> 00:46:27,752
He's not?

496
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:32,040
Wait, I...

497
00:46:32,215 --> 00:46:34,459
I'm in a little bit of a rush here.

498
00:46:34,554 --> 00:46:37,801
If you could only tell me where he is...

499
00:46:38,046 --> 00:46:39,371
Listen!

500
00:46:39,514 --> 00:46:41,886
<i>Someone's life depends on this!</i>

501
00:46:41,994 --> 00:46:42,953
<i>Hello?</i>

502
00:46:43,084 --> 00:46:45,287
He...Hello...

503
00:46:48,469 --> 00:46:49,891
You disappoint me.

504
00:46:50,047 --> 00:46:53,413
I didn't think you'd be
capable of stooping so low.

505
00:46:53,638 --> 00:46:54,942
Just a little...

506
00:46:55,186 --> 00:46:57,774
If you give me just a little more time...

507
00:46:59,231 --> 00:47:00,697
Sign.

508
00:47:08,554 --> 00:47:10,471
<i>Sign.</i>

509
00:47:24,731 --> 00:47:27,171
Get off of me!

510
00:47:27,350 --> 00:47:28,701
You fools, let go!

511
00:47:28,881 --> 00:47:30,282
Let go!

512
00:47:30,486 --> 00:47:31,672
You little fools...

513
00:47:31,804 --> 00:47:33,241
Let go!

514
00:47:33,318 --> 00:47:34,727
<i>It hurts! Let go!</i>

515
00:47:34,822 --> 00:47:36,140
Dad!

516
00:47:36,284 --> 00:47:38,066
What are you doing?

517
00:47:38,641 --> 00:47:41,351
What did he ever do wrong?

518
00:47:42,747 --> 00:47:44,894
Jeongyeon?!

519
00:47:45,032 --> 00:47:46,823
What are you doing here?

520
00:47:46,931 --> 00:47:48,871
Dad...

521
00:47:49,307 --> 00:47:51,694
Stop embarrassing yourself,

522
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:54,076
and just sign that document.

523
00:47:59,213 --> 00:48:00,881
Don't sign it.

524
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:03,324
He said to endure at all cost.

525
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:05,351
Who?

526
00:48:06,812 --> 00:48:07,962
Gangmo.

527
00:48:08,094 --> 00:48:09,603
Gangmo?!

528
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,712
The shoeshine boy?

529
00:48:12,910 --> 00:48:15,929
Said to buy time, one way or another.

530
00:48:16,222 --> 00:48:17,791
He did?

531
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:19,289
There!

532
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:21,229
Listen to me.

533
00:48:23,565 --> 00:48:25,003
Just an hour.

534
00:48:25,183 --> 00:48:27,902
Wait just one more hour.

535
00:48:35,436 --> 00:48:39,605
I'll get sick, 
can't we go a little slower?

536
00:48:39,712 --> 00:48:40,695
No way.

537
00:48:40,815 --> 00:48:42,132
Go faster, faster!

538
00:48:42,228 --> 00:48:45,078
What am I supposed to do, fly there?

539
00:49:05,037 --> 00:49:06,858
It is time.

540
00:49:07,157 --> 00:49:10,440
We can no longer postpone this.

541
00:49:43,872 --> 00:49:46,052
Dad...

542
00:49:46,759 --> 00:49:48,891
Director...

543
00:50:05,792 --> 00:50:08,881
Don't worry about that Banpo lot.

544
00:50:09,304 --> 00:50:14,534
We'll succeed on your behalf as well.

545
00:50:25,342 --> 00:50:27,572
Let's just go.

546
00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:41,402
The results are out.

547
00:50:44,170 --> 00:50:45,873
Chief.

548
00:50:47,059 --> 00:50:49,048
How did it go?

549
00:50:52,909 --> 00:50:54,954
I'm the chief researcher at
the Geological Research Center.

550
00:50:55,086 --> 00:50:58,806
May I borrow the pedestal a moment?

551
00:50:59,144 --> 00:51:01,256
Yes, go ahead.

552
00:51:08,961 --> 00:51:13,475
A few days ago, Director Hwang, 
who is here with us,

553
00:51:13,619 --> 00:51:21,358
commissioned a research on whether
briquette ash could be used as landfill.

554
00:51:21,488 --> 00:51:24,727
Since all the construction
committee is present today,

555
00:51:24,811 --> 00:51:29,088
I will take this opportunity
to announce the results to everyone.

556
00:51:32,382 --> 00:51:34,467
Results of our experiments...

557
00:51:35,306 --> 00:51:41,233
indicate that, 
compared to sand and gravel,

558
00:51:41,351 --> 00:51:45,107
briquette ash's moisture
absorption rate is remarkably high.

559
00:51:45,299 --> 00:51:48,749
<i>Not to mention in terms of
viscosity and intensity as well.</i>

560
00:51:48,857 --> 00:51:51,084
<i>Briquette ash...</i>

561
00:51:52,881 --> 00:51:58,739
is an excellent alternative
to construction sand.

562
00:52:07,832 --> 00:52:11,090
Then, we no longer need 
to worry about sand.

563
00:52:11,198 --> 00:52:13,870
It's done, we're all safe now!

564
00:52:13,977 --> 00:52:15,587
Thank you, Director Hwang.

565
00:52:15,701 --> 00:52:17,979
<i>This is all thanks to you.</i>

566
00:52:18,957 --> 00:52:22,217
He already signed this document.

567
00:52:23,247 --> 00:52:28,219
So our Daeryuk Construction will be 
assigned the Banpo lot as expected.

568
00:52:28,327 --> 00:52:29,932
<i>How can you say that?</i>

569
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:32,941
It clearly has to remain in
Manbo Construction's hands!

570
00:52:33,122 --> 00:52:35,358
Contracts are contracts.

571
00:52:35,525 --> 00:52:36,543
Isn't that right, Commissioner?

572
00:52:36,663 --> 00:52:38,544
What does that 
piece of paper matter anyway?

573
00:52:38,664 --> 00:52:40,509
Or just sue him, Director Hwang.

574
00:52:40,628 --> 00:52:44,140
We will all support you,
and testify in court.

575
00:52:44,284 --> 00:52:47,770
- Indeed!
- We will help you in court!

576
00:52:48,455 --> 00:52:49,943
Commissioner Han.

577
00:52:58,327 --> 00:53:00,076
What are you doing?

578
00:53:08,175 --> 00:53:12,150
I'm afraid you'll have to compromise 
on this matter, Director Hong.

579
00:53:12,318 --> 00:53:13,588
What?

580
00:53:14,869 --> 00:53:18,939
We have now solved the sand issue,
so we truly owe you a lot.

581
00:53:19,073 --> 00:53:23,966
You may complete the
landfill project in Banpo.

582
00:53:57,366 --> 00:53:59,450
My own home feels unfamiliar...

583
00:53:59,546 --> 00:54:01,247
<i>Honey!
Honey!!</i>

584
00:54:01,355 --> 00:54:04,460
- Honey...
- Daddy.

585
00:54:05,041 --> 00:54:06,993
Aigoo... What is this?

586
00:54:07,053 --> 00:54:09,509
What did you have to go through 
to end up in this state?

587
00:54:09,629 --> 00:54:11,989
- Ohh Ohh... Listen to you...
- Let's go inside.

588
00:54:12,085 --> 00:54:14,996
I've prepared your favorite, 
beef rib stew.

589
00:54:16,035 --> 00:54:18,411
What are you waiting for? 
Come on in.

590
00:54:19,393 --> 00:54:20,759
Yes...

591
00:54:22,573 --> 00:54:25,095
- Come in.
- What is this little beggar doing here?

592
00:54:25,239 --> 00:54:27,311
<i>Ehh... You really...</i>

593
00:54:27,783 --> 00:54:28,821
Come on, follow me.

594
00:54:29,025 --> 00:54:30,824
Come on.

595
00:54:33,865 --> 00:54:34,879
Hey!

596
00:54:34,974 --> 00:54:37,961
Where are you going
without taking a bath?

597
00:54:41,722 --> 00:54:43,985
<i>Here.
Go ahead and eat.</i>

598
00:54:47,252 --> 00:54:49,568
Why are you drinking again?

599
00:54:49,688 --> 00:54:53,006
Have something to eat first.

600
00:54:53,497 --> 00:54:56,439
Aigoo... And I asked him 
to get a housemaid...

601
00:54:56,530 --> 00:54:59,135
As if he was some servant, 
why bring a boy?!

602
00:54:59,267 --> 00:55:02,166
<i>Enough with that.</i>

603
00:55:02,575 --> 00:55:05,461
I have no intention of 
living here as your servant.

604
00:55:05,941 --> 00:55:07,940
Start with settling your tab.

605
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:09,436
How much is it?

606
00:55:09,541 --> 00:55:11,523
A little over three thousand won.

607
00:55:11,621 --> 00:55:13,521
And if you consider that I
couldn't work because of you,

608
00:55:13,628 --> 00:55:15,952
should make it five thousand 
with interests.

609
00:55:16,284 --> 00:55:17,809
No can do.

610
00:55:17,983 --> 00:55:18,803
What?

611
00:55:19,043 --> 00:55:19,989
Dad...

612
00:55:20,109 --> 00:55:22,302
Even the worst of all loan sharks...

613
00:55:22,385 --> 00:55:25,611
wouldn't add so much interest
in a matter of days, you fool.

614
00:55:25,829 --> 00:55:28,486
- Still...
- Instead.

615
00:55:29,234 --> 00:55:32,163
Go to school.

616
00:55:32,367 --> 00:55:33,745
What?

617
00:55:34,988 --> 00:55:38,792
I'll send you to middle school,

618
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:40,834
so live here with us and study.

619
00:55:40,978 --> 00:55:41,853
Honey!

620
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:43,290
Are you out of your mind?

621
00:55:43,398 --> 00:55:48,226
<i>It's not like he's your son,
why should we look after him?</i>

622
00:55:48,370 --> 00:55:50,523
Just give him whatever he's asking.

623
00:55:50,615 --> 00:55:53,128
Don't question my decisions.

624
00:55:53,228 --> 00:55:53,946
Honey!

625
00:55:54,030 --> 00:55:55,910
Ohh Ohh! You brat...

626
00:55:56,054 --> 00:55:57,264
Forget it.

627
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:59,516
I'll earn money for school on my own.

628
00:55:59,672 --> 00:56:02,236
Don't question me, either.

629
00:56:05,261 --> 00:56:07,293
Eat your dinner,

630
00:56:07,416 --> 00:56:10,029
pack your bags and come live here.

631
00:56:36,809 --> 00:56:37,899
Let's go in.

632
00:56:38,055 --> 00:56:40,067
Everyone is waiting for you.

633
00:56:46,316 --> 00:56:49,077
<i>Fella looks quite fierce?!</i>

634
00:56:49,244 --> 00:56:50,478
Who's translating?

635
00:56:50,586 --> 00:56:53,018
He's quite fluent in Korean.

636
00:56:53,138 --> 00:56:54,659
Ohh, is that so?

637
00:56:54,803 --> 00:56:58,048
Hampton.
I'm General Hampton.

638
00:56:59,018 --> 00:57:02,043
I'm Congressman Oh Byeongtak
of the Republican Party.

639
00:57:02,135 --> 00:57:03,960
Well, I trust we can
spare the introductions,

640
00:57:04,086 --> 00:57:06,846
so let's get straight to the point.

641
00:57:07,363 --> 00:57:10,287
Concerning that secret document 
we just acquired.

642
00:57:10,417 --> 00:57:13,449
It's quite the shocking material?!

643
00:57:13,699 --> 00:57:19,625
The reality of that Gulf of Tonkin incident
you used to justify deployment in Vietnam...

644
00:57:19,870 --> 00:57:22,626
seems to be a little different
from what was reported by the press?!

645
00:57:22,781 --> 00:57:23,620
That's enough.

646
00:57:23,716 --> 00:57:27,093
Needless to say, 
should the world press learn of this,

647
00:57:27,177 --> 00:57:30,172
the American government would be on 
the receiving end of severe criticism.

648
00:57:30,303 --> 00:57:31,501
I said that's quite enough!

649
00:57:31,597 --> 00:57:36,288
And when they learn someone distorted
the truth about this Vietnam war,

650
00:57:36,509 --> 00:57:39,863
the Nixon government will
certainly not spare you.

651
00:57:40,258 --> 00:57:43,660
What is it that you want from me?

652
00:57:48,208 --> 00:57:51,393
There must be a reason
why you're doing this to me.

653
00:57:53,569 --> 00:57:59,265
Give us the namesake account list 
in your brigade's possesion.

654
00:58:01,713 --> 00:58:04,878
The South Seoul redevelopment plan 
is a project our government...

655
00:58:04,974 --> 00:58:06,842
is pouring its heart and soul into.

656
00:58:06,938 --> 00:58:11,994
Whether we buy land under namesakes or not, 
it's none of your business.

657
00:58:12,248 --> 00:58:16,283
If you plan to use that list to create
difficulties for us at the upcoming elections,

658
00:58:16,393 --> 00:58:18,233
you better give up, is that clear?

659
00:58:18,332 --> 00:58:20,671
You give me the document,
and I'll give you the list.

660
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:23,446
Ahh... That's not how
you deal with people.

661
00:58:23,577 --> 00:58:26,225
You'll get it back once
the elections are over.

662
00:58:26,333 --> 00:58:31,512
All you need to do is
keeping quiet until then.

663
00:58:32,685 --> 00:58:33,631
Fine.

664
00:58:33,759 --> 00:58:36,997
Just make sure that no one
knows about this document.

665
00:58:37,129 --> 00:58:39,309
If we're done talking,
you'll probably be busy...

666
00:58:39,465 --> 00:58:42,065
So I won't rob any more of your time.

667
00:58:54,755 --> 00:58:57,533
Good job.
Have a drink.

668
00:59:05,439 --> 00:59:08,248
Meet the KCIA director tomorrow.

669
00:59:08,524 --> 00:59:11,174
He'll have a position ready for you.

670
00:59:14,193 --> 00:59:16,469
<i>{\a6}*deferential for older colleague</i>

671
00:59:14,193 --> 00:59:16,469
Thank you, Seonbaenim*.

672
00:59:34,811 --> 00:59:36,685
Changing the briquettes when it's needed,

673
00:59:36,827 --> 00:59:40,303
mopping the yard and throwing 
away the trash is your job.

674
00:59:41,084 --> 00:59:43,370
Remember to lock the door 
before you go to sleep.

675
00:59:43,502 --> 00:59:46,613
You'll have to work hard,
if you want to earn your keep.

676
00:59:46,698 --> 00:59:48,233
Is that clear?

677
00:59:48,545 --> 00:59:49,647
Yes.

678
00:59:54,033 --> 00:59:55,363
Nice to meet you.

679
00:59:55,483 --> 00:59:57,003
I'm Lee Gangmo.

680
00:59:57,812 --> 00:59:58,741
Forget it.

681
00:59:58,837 --> 01:00:01,377
You dirty little servant...

682
01:00:45,483 --> 01:00:48,046
Why are you seeing things again?

683
01:00:48,764 --> 01:00:51,281
I'm sure I had enough to eat?!

684
01:00:51,424 --> 01:00:53,401
Even had ribs...

685
01:01:27,675 --> 01:01:31,266
Congratulations for being promoted
to Chief of the Inspection Department.

686
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:35,062
But, what is this Inspection Department?

687
01:01:35,257 --> 01:01:38,182
It's the scariest place in the KCIA.

688
01:01:38,385 --> 01:01:41,033
Oh my! Then... 
Is it dangerous, or something?

689
01:01:41,164 --> 01:01:42,869
You don't need to know.

690
01:01:43,081 --> 01:01:45,741
- Here, have a drink yourself.
- Yes.

691
01:01:50,562 --> 01:01:53,172
- I'm back.
- Minwoo, it's you?

692
01:01:53,485 --> 01:01:58,313
Ahh... Right. He will share
the second floor with you...

693
01:01:58,510 --> 01:02:00,589
What was your name again?

694
01:02:00,829 --> 01:02:02,146
Lee Seongmo.

695
01:02:02,278 --> 01:02:04,572
Right, Lee Seongmo.

696
01:02:04,683 --> 01:02:07,843
Treat him like a brother, understood?

697
01:02:08,023 --> 01:02:09,473
Yes, Dad.

698
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:11,821
Nice to meet you.

699
01:02:13,055 --> 01:02:14,869
I'll go study now.

700
01:02:15,011 --> 01:02:16,397
All right.

701
01:03:10,964 --> 01:03:13,561
I said I don't want to!

702
01:03:13,681 --> 01:03:16,427
I don't want to!

703
01:03:16,798 --> 01:03:17,577
Miju.

704
01:03:17,685 --> 01:03:20,165
You have a mom and dad now.

705
01:03:20,284 --> 01:03:24,314
You'll get to eat tasty food
and they'll even send you to school.

706
01:03:24,458 --> 01:03:27,537
I said no!

707
01:03:30,017 --> 01:03:31,937
You don't like us?

708
01:03:32,029 --> 01:03:37,082
My brothers will come for me!

709
01:03:37,202 --> 01:03:39,595
<i>Brothers?!</i>

710
01:03:39,692 --> 01:03:41,407
Where are your brothers?

711
01:03:41,563 --> 01:03:44,007
Director...

712
01:03:44,293 --> 01:03:47,493
Please, find my brothers.

713
01:03:47,672 --> 01:03:48,906
Uh?

714
01:03:49,110 --> 01:03:55,196
Let me stay together with my brothers.

715
01:03:55,364 --> 01:03:58,586
<i>Director...</i>

716
01:03:58,986 --> 01:04:02,180
Oppa...

717
01:04:02,564 --> 01:04:06,004
Where have you gone?

718
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:10,641
Oppa...

719
01:04:10,952 --> 01:04:15,301
Oppa...

720
01:04:18,635 --> 01:04:21,845
Where have you gone, Oppa?

721
01:04:22,109 --> 01:04:26,285
Oppa...

722
01:04:40,406 --> 01:04:43,185
Hey! Want to be late on your first day?

723
01:04:43,497 --> 01:04:46,339
All right.

724
01:04:55,926 --> 01:04:59,578
- All right!
- Wait... Wait a moment!

725
01:05:00,047 --> 01:05:02,029
Quick!

726
01:05:04,196 --> 01:05:05,864
All right.

727
01:05:08,085 --> 01:05:09,838
We made it.

728
01:05:17,864 --> 01:05:20,212
Jeongyeon, are you okay?

729
01:05:22,884 --> 01:05:25,476
Girls with no prudence...

730
01:05:26,691 --> 01:05:27,812
What?

731
01:05:28,824 --> 01:05:30,532
What did you just say?

732
01:05:30,651 --> 01:05:32,712
Girls without what?!

733
01:05:32,832 --> 01:05:35,333
When you wear a skirt,
you should be careful.

734
01:05:35,635 --> 01:05:39,629
I bet all the boys here saw your panties.

735
01:05:42,422 --> 01:05:44,255
You saw them too, didn't you?

736
01:05:46,458 --> 01:05:49,969
Seeing you get all red, must be right.

737
01:05:52,761 --> 01:05:53,821
You.

738
01:05:53,989 --> 01:05:56,720
If you don't want a beating,
keep your mouth shut.

739
01:05:58,969 --> 01:06:01,448
A beating from who, you?

<i>Aren't you Min Honggi?!
You worked under me a decade ago, right?</i>

748
01:06:29,815 --> 01:06:32,313
Whether your superior will shake
your hand or not, it's up to him.

749
01:06:32,397 --> 01:06:34,256
You're dead last!

750
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:37,632
<i>If you don't end up within the
school's top ten, you'll have to quit.</i>

751
01:06:37,823 --> 01:06:40,183
<i>Director Min will put you 
through a few tests.</i>

752
01:06:40,291 --> 01:06:44,372
<i>You must pass them to enter the KCIA.</i>

753
01:06:44,492 --> 01:06:46,385
<i>Are you interested in Jo Minwoo?</i>

754
01:06:46,516 --> 01:06:49,667
<i>Then, try to beat Jo Minwoo 
at the next midterms.</i>

755
01:06:49,775 --> 01:06:51,452
<i>I'll go with you to the movies.</i>

756
01:06:51,620 --> 01:06:53,524
You son of a bitch!

757
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:55,142
What are you, some gangster?

758
01:06:55,261 --> 01:06:57,606
Chief Jo, do you know him?

759
01:06:57,714 --> 01:07:00,505
No. Not really.
