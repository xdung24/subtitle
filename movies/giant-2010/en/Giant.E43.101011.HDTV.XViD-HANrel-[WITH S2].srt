- Episode 43 -

4
00:00:20,691 --> 00:00:21,530
So it was you?

5
00:00:21,656 --> 00:00:23,080
I'm sure they treated you well enough?!

6
00:00:23,259 --> 00:00:25,139
Who did you do this for?

7
00:00:25,228 --> 00:00:27,728
That's none of your business.

8
00:00:27,885 --> 00:00:31,802
Just stay here quietly,
and be glad if you're sold to a brothel...

9
00:00:33,513 --> 00:00:37,005
I knew it the moment 
I saw you punch that sandbag,

10
00:00:37,403 --> 00:00:38,566
but you sure can hit?

11
00:00:38,722 --> 00:00:41,660
If you don't set me free 
right this moment,

12
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:43,902
you will all...

13
00:00:46,926 --> 00:00:49,549
<i>You insolent little bitch...</i>

14
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:52,730
<i>Director Yoo Gyeongok?</i>

15
00:00:53,516 --> 00:00:54,446
That'd be me.

16
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:57,929
We have your daughter.

17
00:00:58,639 --> 00:01:00,455
Who are you people?

18
00:01:04,358 --> 00:01:06,259
<i>I asked you a question!</i>

19
00:01:07,168 --> 00:01:09,206
<i>What are you asking?</i>

20
00:01:10,156 --> 00:01:11,378
Hello?

21
00:01:11,618 --> 00:01:13,250
Hello?!

22
00:01:19,054 --> 00:01:21,267
<i>Listen well.</i>

23
00:01:25,137 --> 00:01:27,308
Whomever you are,

24
00:01:28,571 --> 00:01:30,544
and whatever you're asking,

25
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:33,708
it doesn't matter.

26
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,285
Because I...

27
00:01:38,344 --> 00:01:40,765
will kill you all.

28
00:01:42,184 --> 00:01:44,569
<i>You will regret abducting Jeongyeon...</i>

29
00:01:45,236 --> 00:01:47,833
even from six feet under.

30
00:01:49,947 --> 00:01:52,771
Because I'll follow you into
the pits of hell if I have to,

31
00:01:54,431 --> 00:01:59,380
and tear you apart limb from limb!

32
00:02:09,257 --> 00:02:11,376
The moment you 
report this to the police,

33
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,124
you know that 
Hwang Jeongyeon will die, right?

34
00:02:14,371 --> 00:02:18,245
<i>Wait quietly until we call you back.</i>

35
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:29,575
Those people know that
Jeongyeon is my daughter.

36
00:02:38,046 --> 00:02:40,610
Tell me everything
that happened earlier on.

37
00:02:40,813 --> 00:02:45,196
This guy came asking for a loan.

38
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:47,765
Looked like she knew him really well...

39
00:02:47,985 --> 00:02:51,462
His name was... Hwang Jeong...

40
00:02:51,632 --> 00:02:52,924
Hwang Jeongshik?

41
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,187
Yes! That's the one.
Hwang Jeongshik.

42
00:02:56,642 --> 00:02:58,838
If it was Hwang Jeongshik...

43
00:03:22,126 --> 00:03:25,737
This has something 
to do with Cha Bucheol.

44
00:03:27,121 --> 00:03:28,867
What's that supposed to mean?

45
00:03:29,051 --> 00:03:33,743
Those two have been 
hanging out together for a while.

46
00:03:36,336 --> 00:03:38,011
Director...

47
00:03:38,687 --> 00:03:41,572
<i>They'll soon tell you their conditions.</i>

48
00:03:41,682 --> 00:03:44,454
But never let them get any leverage.

49
00:03:44,614 --> 00:03:46,497
You know what I mean?

50
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,794
Are you telling me 
to ignore their requests?

51
00:03:49,943 --> 00:03:54,200
If you do, Jeongyeon could be in danger.

52
00:03:54,598 --> 00:03:59,777
If only to buy time, 
we must play hardball with them.

53
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:04,598
But what if something
happens to Jeongyeon...

54
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:08,561
Before that can happen,
I'll find Jeongyeon and rescue her.

55
00:04:10,176 --> 00:04:12,634
You can bet on it.

56
00:04:15,682 --> 00:04:20,016
To people like us, intel means money.

57
00:04:20,223 --> 00:04:21,296
If we only wanted to,

58
00:04:21,424 --> 00:04:24,739
we could hear the whispers people
in the slums make under their bedcovers.

59
00:04:24,915 --> 00:04:26,434
Is that so?

60
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:28,752
I bet.

61
00:04:29,045 --> 00:04:34,551
And we're also perfectly aware
that you launched this tax investigation.

62
00:04:36,226 --> 00:04:38,328
Please overturn that order.

63
00:04:39,052 --> 00:04:41,043
Sounds like a favor to me?!

64
00:04:41,308 --> 00:04:43,790
But the way you're asking it 
seems a little coarse.

65
00:04:43,897 --> 00:04:46,221
If that is the case, 
I can only apologize,

66
00:04:46,299 --> 00:04:50,149
but honestly, that is
how I feel at the moment.

67
00:04:50,745 --> 00:04:52,914
When it comes to taxes,

68
00:04:53,027 --> 00:04:56,222
I can open the dances, 
but I can't change the tune on my own.

69
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,954
Congressman Jo.

70
00:04:58,185 --> 00:05:04,524
So I hear you'll be forced to give back
all the principal that Baekpa lent you?

71
00:05:06,426 --> 00:05:09,760
Intel is money on this side 
of the pond as well.

72
00:05:13,421 --> 00:05:15,672
And once that principal is retrieved,

73
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,497
I'm sure the balance of power 
will go through significant changes?

74
00:05:18,589 --> 00:05:22,696
Will Yoo Gyeongok 
become your new kingpin?

75
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:26,657
I better get up.

76
00:05:26,955 --> 00:05:29,353
I'm not done talking.

77
00:05:31,113 --> 00:05:36,775
We will devote our most earnest efforts
to pay the taxes you so cordially asked.

78
00:05:42,528 --> 00:05:44,294
Just sit.

79
00:05:45,969 --> 00:05:51,389
He's going to fight with Yoo Gyeongok
over the underground market.

80
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:55,236
Still, how dare he...

81
00:05:55,434 --> 00:05:59,533
In the end, 
he'll be groveling at my feet.

82
00:05:59,641 --> 00:06:01,275
Although it will be easier 
said than done,

83
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:03,716
we need to make that happen.

84
00:06:29,421 --> 00:06:32,648
Hey... That way!

85
00:06:32,884 --> 00:06:34,464
Shoot!

86
00:07:13,555 --> 00:07:14,497
<i>Gangmo.</i>

87
00:07:14,597 --> 00:07:15,540
How did it go?

88
00:07:15,631 --> 00:07:17,023
How about Hwang Jeongshik?

89
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:20,158
He didn't show up at home and
not even at the gambling house.

90
00:07:20,417 --> 00:07:22,673
Looks like he fled already.

91
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,562
That rat bastard...

92
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:33,407
First he gets obsessed with gambling,
and now he even gets his sister involved?!

93
00:07:35,749 --> 00:07:37,626
How are things proceeding
with our boiler issues?

94
00:07:37,739 --> 00:07:40,902
Youngchul Hyungnim is trying to
find out the accident's causes,

95
00:07:41,012 --> 00:07:43,767
so you just focus on Jeongyeon.

96
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:52,586
We can't take it anymore. And it's not
like we can always leave the doors open.

97
00:07:52,684 --> 00:07:54,307
Please find a solution.

98
00:07:54,397 --> 00:07:56,595
Yes, yes. Don't you worry.

99
00:07:56,723 --> 00:07:59,668
We will deal with it right away.

100
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,321
Go back in.

101
00:08:01,505 --> 00:08:03,152
See you.

102
00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:07,450
So there were no problems 
with the boiler?

103
00:08:07,592 --> 00:08:08,472
None.

104
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,979
It's not a technical defect for sure.

105
00:08:11,076 --> 00:08:12,857
I'll be damned...

106
00:08:12,956 --> 00:08:16,035
I could smell gas from a mile away...

107
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:31,311
Were you looking for me, Chairman?

108
00:08:31,737 --> 00:08:37,107
So I hear Hangang Construction
is checking boilers door by door?

109
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:38,370
Yes.

110
00:08:39,094 --> 00:08:40,925
And did they find what the problem was?

111
00:08:41,067 --> 00:08:45,636
Even the Beaute engineers 
haven't been able to find the answer.

112
00:08:49,893 --> 00:08:53,056
Maybe it's exactly because they're
engineers that they can't find it.

113
00:08:53,129 --> 00:08:54,749
What?

114
00:08:55,231 --> 00:08:57,416
<i>This is not a defect.</i>

115
00:08:57,785 --> 00:09:00,212
What are you trying to say?

116
00:09:00,638 --> 00:09:02,740
I've examined that data all night,

117
00:09:02,835 --> 00:09:06,626
and there was only one difference between
the European boiler system and Korea's.

118
00:09:06,768 --> 00:09:08,850
And what is that, Chairman?

119
00:09:09,035 --> 00:09:10,173
Gas.

120
00:09:10,275 --> 00:09:12,178
What?! Gas?

121
00:09:12,287 --> 00:09:15,336
The gas we use is different 
from the Europeans'.

122
00:09:15,506 --> 00:09:17,449
<i>Contact the research lab.</i>

123
00:09:17,592 --> 00:09:18,899
<i>If my guess is right,</i>

124
00:09:19,008 --> 00:09:24,346
we will able to make new inroads into
the development of our ondol-styled boiler.

125
00:09:24,588 --> 00:09:25,966
All right, Chairman.

126
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,456
Ahh...

127
00:09:27,698 --> 00:09:29,632
How did it go with the ads about Lee Miju?

128
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:31,983
We started with the evening
edition of the four major dailies,

129
00:09:32,097 --> 00:09:34,125
and leaflets will be distributed as well.

130
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:04,261
<i>- Kang Wooju -</i>

131
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:10,984
Aren't you playing with your buddies?

132
00:10:15,771 --> 00:10:17,744
<i>What is this called?</i>

133
00:10:25,464 --> 00:10:26,836
So you don't know.

134
00:10:27,011 --> 00:10:28,509
- Lion.
- Ohh!

135
00:10:28,643 --> 00:10:30,595
You know the lion!

136
00:10:31,158 --> 00:10:32,857
Let's see what's next...

137
00:10:32,952 --> 00:10:34,324
<i>So what is this one?</i>

138
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,622
Elephant.

139
00:10:35,717 --> 00:10:39,027
Wow... Even the elephant?!
You're good.

140
00:10:39,242 --> 00:10:40,603
Then...

141
00:10:44,292 --> 00:10:46,561
Should your uncl... No.

142
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:50,152
Should this ajeosshi buy you ice cream?

143
00:10:50,265 --> 00:10:52,706
Wooju doesn't like ice cream.

144
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,551
You don't...

145
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,148
How about chocolate?

146
00:10:59,262 --> 00:11:00,497
You like it?

147
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:02,498
<i>Wooju...</i>

148
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:05,739
Wooju.

149
00:11:06,902 --> 00:11:09,982
Let's stop reading and go back in, uh?

150
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,655
<i>Lee Miju.</i>

151
00:11:43,734 --> 00:11:45,337
Big Oppa...

152
00:11:45,848 --> 00:11:48,204
Thanks for the invites.

153
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:53,260
I just couldn't wait until the concert.

154
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:55,437
Missed you too much.

155
00:11:56,785 --> 00:11:58,704
Seongmo Oppa...

156
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,801
Had lunch?

157
00:12:07,603 --> 00:12:09,121
Here.

158
00:12:09,618 --> 00:12:12,199
It's been hard practicing, uh?

159
00:12:12,308 --> 00:12:14,277
<i>Here...</i>

160
00:12:17,707 --> 00:12:20,276
Why aren't you asking me anything?

161
00:12:22,465 --> 00:12:25,988
I got rid of the baby.

162
00:12:28,638 --> 00:12:32,044
- The reason I haven't come looking for you...
- I know.

163
00:12:33,293 --> 00:12:36,269
That you wanted to show us 
that you could succeed.

164
00:12:36,486 --> 00:12:37,878
Sorry, Oppa.

165
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,841
You were worried, weren't you?

166
00:12:39,921 --> 00:12:41,539
Nah.

167
00:12:42,731 --> 00:12:45,161
We felt sorry, on the contrary.

168
00:12:45,385 --> 00:12:47,372
And Gangmo Oppa?

169
00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:50,996
Gangmo really misses you.

170
00:12:51,147 --> 00:12:55,461
Actually, we planned to meet you 
after your performance.

171
00:12:55,604 --> 00:13:02,231
But I missed you so much...
Guess I cheated a little.

172
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:05,098
I know that Little Oppa's 
business is doing well.

173
00:13:05,268 --> 00:13:07,368
I've heard the news.

174
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:11,106
But, Miju.

175
00:13:13,987 --> 00:13:18,951
Minwoo is still looking for you.

176
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:26,642
If you get more popular 
after that concert,

177
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,805
you will no longer be able to avoid him.

178
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:36,794
That man is no longer part of my life.

179
00:13:37,674 --> 00:13:39,698
I can't do anything about the past,

180
00:13:39,873 --> 00:13:43,648
but he and I are through for good.

181
00:13:44,022 --> 00:13:48,903
I won't ever meet Minwoo again.

182
00:13:50,805 --> 00:13:52,959
Stop worrying, Big Oppa.

183
00:13:53,147 --> 00:13:57,234
From now on, 
I'll only focus on succeeding.

184
00:14:12,432 --> 00:14:14,301
<i>Come on in.</i>

185
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,397
Are you out of your mind?

186
00:14:26,051 --> 00:14:28,341
Didn't I tell you to keep a low profile?

187
00:14:28,606 --> 00:14:30,395
Hey, Cha Bucheol.

188
00:14:31,473 --> 00:14:34,411
Looks like you underestimated me.

189
00:14:34,638 --> 00:14:35,944
What?!

190
00:14:36,256 --> 00:14:41,719
So while I was "keeping a low profile,"
you'd frame me for abduction?

191
00:14:43,479 --> 00:14:46,038
I see we've got some brains up there.

192
00:14:46,141 --> 00:14:48,854
Let's renegotiate.

193
00:14:50,738 --> 00:14:51,524
What's that supposed to mean?

194
00:14:51,616 --> 00:14:57,096
I'm afraid a few months'
worth of interests won't do.

195
00:14:58,827 --> 00:15:00,091
So?

196
00:15:00,431 --> 00:15:02,727
Cancel all my debts.

197
00:15:02,914 --> 00:15:05,240
Hey... Hwang Jeongshik!

198
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:09,598
I could also get rid of you?!

199
00:15:10,052 --> 00:15:11,044
Go ahead.

200
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,543
I've got nothing to lose anyway.

201
00:15:13,742 --> 00:15:16,147
- You little son of a...
- If you lay a finger on me,

202
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:19,299
you'll be reported 
to the police right away.

203
00:15:22,776 --> 00:15:26,153
So you said that Yoo Gyeongok
is Jeongyeon's mother?

204
00:15:26,466 --> 00:15:29,731
She might not report you, but I can?!

205
00:15:29,928 --> 00:15:31,119
Should I try?

206
00:15:31,319 --> 00:15:35,658
Shall we see whether I die first,
or the report gets to them faster?

207
00:15:37,817 --> 00:15:40,045
I guess negotiations are over?!

208
00:15:40,292 --> 00:15:45,041
Stop trying to use my
gambling debts to blackmail me.

209
00:16:13,368 --> 00:16:16,704
<i>- Congressman Oh Byeongtak -
Autobiography Publication Party</i>

210
00:16:33,301 --> 00:16:35,703
<i>- On The Path to History -</i>

211
00:16:38,307 --> 00:16:42,649
I should thank you
for this publication party.

212
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:44,662
I'm glad you liked it.

213
00:16:44,821 --> 00:16:50,215
I hear there's no ruling party member 
who doesn't owe you big time?!

214
00:16:50,477 --> 00:16:53,908
I really haven't done anything special.

215
00:16:54,185 --> 00:16:55,984
Director Hwang.

216
00:16:56,966 --> 00:16:58,828
You wanted to meet him, right?
Here's Congressman Park.

217
00:16:58,921 --> 00:17:01,820
Congressman, I've heard a lot about you.

218
00:17:03,068 --> 00:17:06,943
I'm Hwang Taeseop.

219
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:13,908
These days, that Hwang Taeseop
is making his ambitions pretty clear.

220
00:17:14,002 --> 00:17:16,233
I've heard that not only Congressman Oh,

221
00:17:16,417 --> 00:17:21,469
but just about every congressman
capable of recommending him is being helped.

222
00:17:21,753 --> 00:17:26,595
<i>I really don't know where he would find 
the money to help all those congressmen.</i>

223
00:17:26,733 --> 00:17:29,307
<i>There's no way the money would be his,</i>

224
00:17:29,429 --> 00:17:33,471
so I guess Yoo Gyeongok is
backing him from behind the curtains.

225
00:17:43,927 --> 00:17:48,298
If you'll excuse me a moment,
I will be right back.

226
00:18:04,423 --> 00:18:06,154
That way.

227
00:18:08,964 --> 00:18:11,678
What is that supposed to mean?

228
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,938
Jeongyeon was abducted?!

229
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:19,227
So I hear Director 
Yoo Gyeongok is her mother?

230
00:18:20,575 --> 00:18:21,598
What...

231
00:18:21,796 --> 00:18:24,907
Where did you hear that?

232
00:18:26,649 --> 00:18:29,306
I've heard it from the
people who abducted her.

233
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:30,868
And who are they?

234
00:18:30,957 --> 00:18:33,363
Who abducted my daughter?

235
00:18:33,468 --> 00:18:35,450
I don't know them, either.

236
00:18:35,545 --> 00:18:39,291
But after being with Jeongyeon,
they suddenly showed up...

237
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:41,943
Shouldn't we report this to the police?

238
00:18:42,043 --> 00:18:47,624
It looked like they'd kill her
right away, in case we did.

239
00:18:50,434 --> 00:18:52,321
Gyeongok...

240
00:18:55,004 --> 00:18:57,501
I'll have to head to the Royal Club.

241
00:19:04,986 --> 00:19:10,294
Yoo Gyeongok is her mother?

242
00:19:11,585 --> 00:19:17,788
So you abandoned Mom just as she said?!

243
00:19:33,484 --> 00:19:34,434
What?

244
00:19:34,676 --> 00:19:36,431
Hwang Jeongyeon was abducted?

245
00:19:36,648 --> 00:19:37,368
Yes.

246
00:19:37,542 --> 00:19:39,020
Who's behind this?

247
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,645
I don't think they had any idea.

248
00:19:40,849 --> 00:19:42,001
Did they report it to the police?

249
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,434
They're holding back, 
fearing for her life.

250
00:19:45,527 --> 00:19:47,631
Something is up for sure.

251
00:19:47,745 --> 00:19:51,568
There must be some internal struggle
within the private lending organization.

252
00:19:51,658 --> 00:19:54,239
Doesn't this benefit you?

253
00:19:55,417 --> 00:20:00,267
I don't think turning that 
organization against us would be wise.

254
00:20:00,512 --> 00:20:05,342
We could actually gain control of the
whole operation, if things go our way.

255
00:20:05,531 --> 00:20:08,596
Is that so? I see...

256
00:20:09,192 --> 00:20:12,872
- Find out what's going on in detail.
- Yes, Congressman.

257
00:20:13,364 --> 00:20:15,119
Jeongshik is still outside, right?

258
00:20:15,351 --> 00:20:17,849
If you hurry up, 
you might be able to meet him.

259
00:20:19,715 --> 00:20:25,831
Just like Minwoo said, if we play
our cards well, the whole pot is ours.

260
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,628
Aigoo... Congressman Jo.

261
00:20:29,819 --> 00:20:34,713
I really enjoyed your book.
It was truly touching.

262
00:20:48,929 --> 00:20:50,767
Gangmo!

263
00:20:51,661 --> 00:20:53,691
Hwang Jeongshik has shown up!

264
00:20:54,258 --> 00:20:55,280
Where is he now?

265
00:20:55,408 --> 00:20:58,035
He went to a saloon with Jo Minwoo.

266
00:20:58,175 --> 00:21:00,318
Sotae went after him.

267
00:21:07,236 --> 00:21:08,052
What's that?

268
00:21:08,143 --> 00:21:10,300
I hear Jeongyeon was abducted.

269
00:21:10,571 --> 00:21:12,771
It has something to do with you, right?

270
00:21:16,021 --> 00:21:17,787
Doesn't it?

271
00:21:19,313 --> 00:21:22,698
And why would you 
show any interest in this?

272
00:21:25,662 --> 00:21:26,840
Ahh...

273
00:21:27,407 --> 00:21:30,671
By any chance, 
were you aware of it as well?

274
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:34,602
That Jeongyeon was
Yoo Gyeongok's daughter.

275
00:21:37,057 --> 00:21:42,511
This whole thing was 
orchestrated by Cha Bucheol, right?

276
00:21:44,409 --> 00:21:45,388
Wh...What?!

277
00:21:45,474 --> 00:21:51,477
The only one who knew Yoo Gyeongok 
was Jeongyeon's mother is him.

278
00:21:58,171 --> 00:22:01,048
G...G...Gangmo...

279
00:22:01,932 --> 00:22:03,165
What's with you?

280
00:22:03,294 --> 00:22:05,005
Get the hell out!

281
00:22:06,061 --> 00:22:08,545
Are you involved 
with Jeongyeon's abduction?

282
00:22:08,715 --> 00:22:10,357
What's that bullshit supposed to mean?

283
00:22:10,435 --> 00:22:16,779
If that's not the case, 
stay put and don't get in the way.

284
00:22:18,567 --> 00:22:19,968
Take him out.

285
00:22:20,099 --> 00:22:23,122
- Come...
- Let go.

286
00:22:35,664 --> 00:22:37,226
Director Moon.

287
00:22:37,409 --> 00:22:38,906
You have Cha Bucheol's number, right?

288
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:44,629
I wonder if he's moved his office or 
something, but I can't reach him as of late.

289
00:22:44,887 --> 00:22:47,896
Cha Bucheol, that third-rate thug...

290
00:22:48,234 --> 00:22:50,246
How can he handle it this way...

291
00:22:50,947 --> 00:22:53,161
I do remember his car phone number.

292
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,938
I'm sure he hasn't changed that.

293
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:06,799
Gangmo... I don't know.

294
00:23:09,283 --> 00:23:12,206
Speak! I said speak!

295
00:23:15,315 --> 00:23:17,047
Where is Jeongyeon?

296
00:23:17,142 --> 00:23:18,997
Where is that bastard Cha Bucheol?

297
00:23:19,108 --> 00:23:22,226
I don't know... I really don't!

298
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:24,985
And I told you it wasn't Bucheol!

299
00:23:25,141 --> 00:23:27,392
You piece of shit!

300
00:23:27,548 --> 00:23:29,578
And you call yourself a man?

301
00:23:29,764 --> 00:23:31,935
Do you?!

302
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,759
Stop him or he'll kill him!

303
00:23:34,858 --> 00:23:36,267
Don't kill me, Gangmo.

304
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:39,951
I was just talking with her, 
and suddenly...

305
00:23:40,042 --> 00:23:43,046
Spare that bullshit 
for who will believe it!

306
00:23:43,365 --> 00:23:45,472
Believe me or not...

307
00:23:45,595 --> 00:23:48,335
I don't know a thing, so just kill me!

308
00:23:48,406 --> 00:23:49,952
Hey... Gangmo!

309
00:23:50,038 --> 00:23:51,797
Looks like he really doesn't know!

310
00:23:51,925 --> 00:23:54,755
Fine... Kill me!

311
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:59,432
Let's see you become a murderer!

312
00:24:32,709 --> 00:24:33,753
Hey...

313
00:24:33,976 --> 00:24:36,411
If anything happens to Jeongyeon,

314
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:39,046
then we won't even try 
to stop Gangmo! Is that clear?

315
00:24:39,136 --> 00:24:42,478
I don't know...
I don't know a damned thing!

316
00:24:42,567 --> 00:24:44,428
Sorry-ass son of a cunt.

317
00:24:44,576 --> 00:24:49,435
Even in my prime, 
I never stooped this low.

318
00:24:51,527 --> 00:24:54,771
Pathetic asswipe... Ehh...

319
00:25:03,158 --> 00:25:09,149
You better stop looking down on me.

320
00:25:09,611 --> 00:25:15,330
Because you will soon regret 
everything you did to me.

321
00:25:37,387 --> 00:25:41,673
You look so quiet and
obedient when you sleep...

322
00:25:45,292 --> 00:25:50,088
So let's start doing as I say, shall we?

323
00:25:53,323 --> 00:25:55,966
It's precious goods we're dealing with.

324
00:25:57,095 --> 00:26:01,387
I'm doing my best
to handle them with care...

325
00:26:14,082 --> 00:26:15,673
What's with the surprise?

326
00:26:15,898 --> 00:26:18,396
Afraid I'll bite you?

327
00:26:20,383 --> 00:26:23,287
You rat bastard...

328
00:26:23,647 --> 00:26:26,328
- You crazy...
- Hyungnim.

329
00:26:28,018 --> 00:26:29,353
What is it?

330
00:26:29,707 --> 00:26:33,240
Chairman Jo Minwoo
wants to meet you urgently.

331
00:26:34,588 --> 00:26:38,803
Who the hell does he think he is?
Always bossing me around.

332
00:26:53,081 --> 00:26:55,403
Gangmo...

333
00:27:17,971 --> 00:27:21,103
How have you been, Congressman?

334
00:27:21,334 --> 00:27:24,172
Is Noh Gapsoo behind this?

335
00:27:24,939 --> 00:27:27,592
Hwang Jeongyeon's abduction.

336
00:27:33,049 --> 00:27:35,532
I really don't know
what you're talking about...

337
00:27:35,716 --> 00:27:40,499
I'm sure President Noh would have asked
for a pledge giving up on that principal.

338
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:43,054
Or maybe that IOU list.

339
00:27:43,394 --> 00:27:47,141
I'm afraid I have no idea 
what you're telling me.

340
00:27:48,744 --> 00:27:51,554
You really don't know anything about this?

341
00:27:52,377 --> 00:27:55,407
How could I ever try to deceive you?

342
00:27:55,755 --> 00:27:57,369
You mean it?

343
00:27:57,699 --> 00:27:59,241
I swear to God.

344
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:01,518
Please believe me, Congressman.

345
00:28:07,103 --> 00:28:09,998
All right. You can go.

346
00:28:20,564 --> 00:28:21,847
Are you just letting him go?

347
00:28:21,954 --> 00:28:24,047
Jaechun, you go after him.

348
00:28:24,143 --> 00:28:26,028
Find where their hideout is.

349
00:28:26,212 --> 00:28:27,660
All right.

350
00:28:31,784 --> 00:28:34,216
It's President Noh, all right.

351
00:28:34,313 --> 00:28:38,922
I'll have to get my hands
on that pledge and the IOU list.

352
00:29:10,087 --> 00:29:12,498
Just because I wag my tail around you,

353
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:16,274
you bastards seem to think 
I'm just your little pet.

354
00:29:17,556 --> 00:29:19,003
Let's go.

355
00:29:40,377 --> 00:29:44,234
They said it brings good luck,
so I even wore my wife's panties...

356
00:29:44,336 --> 00:29:47,394
Keeps bothering me...
The hell is this?

357
00:29:47,572 --> 00:29:50,983
I told her to give me
those with flower patterns,

358
00:29:51,092 --> 00:29:53,494
what is with the damned little drums?

359
00:29:53,657 --> 00:29:55,881
Today's not my day, all right.

360
00:29:55,979 --> 00:29:58,893
Hurry up and just give us the cards.

361
00:30:02,143 --> 00:30:04,208
May I join in?

362
00:30:04,463 --> 00:30:07,798
Why the hell not?
Aren't we all here to play?

363
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:10,055
Have a seat.

364
00:30:13,461 --> 00:30:15,786
But, who introduced you to...

365
00:30:15,884 --> 00:30:19,817
If you tell Director Cha that I
come from Myeong-Dong, he should know.

366
00:30:19,906 --> 00:30:23,261
Ahh... Is that so?

367
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:28,529
But Director Cha left
the business to us and quit?

368
00:30:28,883 --> 00:30:29,650
Really?

369
00:30:29,735 --> 00:30:32,604
What's this, a neighborhood meeting?

370
00:30:32,757 --> 00:30:34,872
Let's see the cards.

371
00:31:01,261 --> 00:31:04,291
Here... Let's up the ante a little.

372
00:31:30,708 --> 00:31:34,313
Looks like that Bucheol
really got out of this?

373
00:31:34,441 --> 00:31:40,324
- Should we just look elsewhere?
- That guy is Cha Bucheol's underling.

374
00:31:42,254 --> 00:31:47,292
Judging by how he kept staring at me 
throughout the entire game.

375
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,262
<i>Yes, Hyungnim.</i>

376
00:31:50,371 --> 00:31:53,536
<i>Looks like he came from
the Myeong-Dong lending market.</i>

377
00:31:55,843 --> 00:31:56,600
Yes.

378
00:31:56,765 --> 00:31:58,752
Never really seen him before.

379
00:32:02,073 --> 00:32:03,565
It's obvious.

380
00:32:03,761 --> 00:32:06,817
Must be one of their minions.

381
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:09,656
If he asks for money, refuse.

382
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:10,998
Yes, Hyungnim.

383
00:32:11,109 --> 00:32:12,614
All right.

384
00:32:26,918 --> 00:32:28,504
Must be hungry?

385
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:30,807
Help yourself.

386
00:32:39,548 --> 00:32:42,043
Ahh... So here you were!

387
00:32:42,152 --> 00:32:43,400
Lend me some money, will you?

388
00:32:43,493 --> 00:32:46,184
Looks like it's really not my day.

389
00:32:46,425 --> 00:32:47,915
Just call it a night.

390
00:32:48,071 --> 00:32:50,058
What's wrong with you?
Don't you know me?

391
00:32:50,172 --> 00:32:53,592
<i>I've been a regular ever
since Director Cha's days.</i>

392
00:32:56,898 --> 00:32:58,431
<i>Ahh... You really...</i>

393
00:33:06,893 --> 00:33:08,656
<i>- Redial Last Number -</i>

394
00:33:14,662 --> 00:33:16,690
Just try me!

395
00:33:17,698 --> 00:33:19,222
Try to get any closer!

396
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:21,373
Do you really have a death wish?

397
00:33:21,714 --> 00:33:22,698
Put that down!

398
00:33:22,795 --> 00:33:25,769
What is it that you want?

399
00:33:25,849 --> 00:33:28,238
Why did you abduct me?

400
00:33:28,483 --> 00:33:31,432
Answer the goddamned phone!

401
00:33:32,165 --> 00:33:33,556
What is it?

402
00:33:33,664 --> 00:33:36,905
<i>Catch that brat. Do it!</i>

403
00:33:38,381 --> 00:33:40,793
Let go... Let me go!

404
00:33:43,745 --> 00:33:45,516
<i>- Let go!
- Speak!</i>

405
00:33:45,616 --> 00:33:47,344
<i>The hell are you?</i>

406
00:33:47,638 --> 00:33:52,289
- Is that the dry cleaner's?
- What?

407
00:33:52,537 --> 00:33:53,962
<i>Dry cleaner's?!</i>

408
00:33:54,084 --> 00:33:57,277
<i>You really... I better not 
meet you on the street!</i>

409
00:34:00,087 --> 00:34:01,492
I am sorry.

410
00:34:01,678 --> 00:34:03,550
Looks like I dialed the wrong number.

411
00:34:03,772 --> 00:34:06,859
Don't ever do anything you'll
have to feel sorry about again.

412
00:34:22,015 --> 00:34:25,067
You... What are you doing here?

413
00:34:28,061 --> 00:34:30,303
Where is Cha Bucheol?

414
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:39,929
Tell me!

415
00:34:40,071 --> 00:34:42,540
Where is Cha Bucheol now?

416
00:34:42,923 --> 00:34:44,876
- I don't know...
- You don't?!

417
00:34:45,009 --> 00:34:47,124
Should I encourage you to tell me?

418
00:34:50,793 --> 00:34:52,184
My boys...

419
00:34:52,301 --> 00:34:54,347
are waiting out there.

420
00:34:54,439 --> 00:34:55,734
Speak!

421
00:34:55,825 --> 00:34:58,130
Where is Cha Bucheol?

422
00:35:00,301 --> 00:35:02,628
Hyungnim! It's me.

423
00:35:03,064 --> 00:35:06,795
Go tell Bucheol.

424
00:35:07,497 --> 00:35:11,769
If he doesn't set Jeongyeon
free before I find her,

425
00:35:13,032 --> 00:35:15,572
I will kill him with my own hands.

426
00:35:28,461 --> 00:35:34,176
Ahh... You people.
Can't even lend us some money...

427
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:36,716
Hyungnim!

428
00:35:51,264 --> 00:35:52,624
Turn it off.

429
00:35:55,341 --> 00:35:57,837
Did you close up shop
and send out all the boys?

430
00:35:57,945 --> 00:35:59,555
Yes, Hyungnim.

431
00:36:15,238 --> 00:36:16,643
Hey.

432
00:36:17,281 --> 00:36:20,276
What is going on 
between you and Lee Gangmo?

433
00:36:20,702 --> 00:36:22,901
<i>What the hell do you mean to him,</i>

434
00:36:22,986 --> 00:36:27,038
to frantically prance around
looking for you like a rabid dog?

435
00:36:27,272 --> 00:36:28,071
Are you lovers?

436
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:34,140
I suggest you shut your mouth,
and let me go while you still can.

437
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,269
Or else...

438
00:36:36,766 --> 00:36:38,667
Or else?

439
00:36:39,732 --> 00:36:45,135
Gangmo will beat you to a pulp.

440
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,606
<i>Hey.</i>

441
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:53,848
<i>Hey.</i>

442
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,197
Acting all tough 
just because of Lee Gangmo?

443
00:37:02,916 --> 00:37:05,207
You've been abducted.

444
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:07,747
You might die.

445
00:37:07,954 --> 00:37:09,799
Know that?

446
00:37:11,871 --> 00:37:14,564
What the hell is all this about?

447
00:37:14,819 --> 00:37:17,359
Jeongyeon was abducted?!

448
00:37:32,301 --> 00:37:33,363
Yes?

449
00:37:33,507 --> 00:37:36,133
<i>How have you been?</i>

450
00:37:40,929 --> 00:37:43,526
What do I owe this call to, Director Cha?

451
00:37:43,726 --> 00:37:47,826
<i>Make a wild guess... I'm sure 
you already have a vague idea?!</i>

452
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:51,260
<i>I know that Lee Gangmo is listening.</i>

453
00:37:54,964 --> 00:37:56,862
What are your conditions?

454
00:37:57,604 --> 00:37:59,761
<i>Tell us what you want.</i>

455
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:02,227
Hey, Lee Gangmo.

456
00:38:02,568 --> 00:38:04,824
<i>Will you please 
stay the hell out of this?</i>

457
00:38:05,051 --> 00:38:07,856
This is between me and Director Yoo.

458
00:38:08,074 --> 00:38:10,989
Why are you always getting in the way?

459
00:38:11,281 --> 00:38:15,368
I can see a reservoir from here!
A three-hour drive from Seoul...

460
00:38:18,018 --> 00:38:19,929
Jeongyeon! Jeongyeon!!

461
00:38:20,913 --> 00:38:22,490
Gangmo!

462
00:38:22,729 --> 00:38:24,125
Jeongyeon... What's going on?

463
00:38:24,262 --> 00:38:25,170
Hwang Jeongyeon!

464
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:29,357
- You dare bite me?
- Get her out of here, you idiot!

465
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,667
I'll make things simple, so listen well.

466
00:38:42,163 --> 00:38:44,803
You know the principal which
was supposed to be retrieved?

467
00:38:44,983 --> 00:38:47,740
Write a pledge renouncing it.

468
00:38:49,352 --> 00:38:53,453
<i>Give us the IOU list you're carrying,
or else your daughter is dead.</i>

469
00:38:53,638 --> 00:38:55,994
<i>Are we listening, Director Yoo?</i>

470
00:39:02,763 --> 00:39:06,123
And who said Hwang Jeongyeon 
is my daughter?

471
00:39:06,328 --> 00:39:07,860
<i>What?</i>

472
00:39:09,095 --> 00:39:12,103
I don't know where 
you heard that nonsense,

473
00:39:12,543 --> 00:39:14,119
but I'm afraid you're wrong.

474
00:39:14,615 --> 00:39:18,838
If she was my daughter,
why would I hide it?

475
00:39:18,944 --> 00:39:20,053
Don't you think?

476
00:39:20,147 --> 00:39:24,359
I've heard what you and
Baekpa said loud and clear!

477
00:39:24,604 --> 00:39:26,746
Hwang Jeongyeon is your daughter!!

478
00:39:26,832 --> 00:39:32,522
To me, Hwang Jeongyeon is not
as important as Baekpa's last wishes.

479
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:38,428
You made a wrong guess.
Check your sources and call us again.

480
00:39:39,518 --> 00:39:42,428
Gyeongok. What are you...

481
00:39:44,414 --> 00:39:46,302
Well done.

482
00:39:47,806 --> 00:39:52,314
But will anything happen to Jeongyeon?

483
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:54,954
We at least bought some time,

484
00:39:55,147 --> 00:39:58,638
so the key is how long it
will take for us to find her.

485
00:40:05,805 --> 00:40:10,636
Just as I thought,
the organization was behind this.

486
00:40:11,019 --> 00:40:16,681
Any idea who might
have orchestrated this all?

487
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:20,002
I do have someone in mind,

488
00:40:20,601 --> 00:40:23,555
but I can't let
speculations cloud my judgment.

489
00:40:26,635 --> 00:40:28,110
Gyeongok...

490
00:40:28,257 --> 00:40:30,026
Are you all right?

491
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:57,535
This all happened because of me.

492
00:40:59,465 --> 00:41:01,821
I even thought that,
when the time would come,

493
00:41:02,331 --> 00:41:07,483
I'd give her everything I have.

494
00:41:08,689 --> 00:41:11,952
Because that was the only way...

495
00:41:12,049 --> 00:41:14,634
to make it up to her.

496
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:23,461
That was the only thing that helped me
endure all this over the years...

497
00:41:27,364 --> 00:41:31,779
Yeah... I know what you're feeling.

498
00:41:32,019 --> 00:41:33,879
I know.

499
00:41:38,774 --> 00:41:45,087
But it's exactly in times like these
that we need to get a hold of ourselves.

500
00:41:45,224 --> 00:41:48,346
It's the only way to save Jeongyeon.

501
00:41:49,595 --> 00:41:53,895
First, let's do what Gangmo suggested.

502
00:41:54,519 --> 00:42:00,799
I'm sure he'll be able to rescue her.

503
00:42:23,192 --> 00:42:24,337
Why?

504
00:42:24,569 --> 00:42:25,846
Raise a ruckus again, will you?

505
00:42:25,959 --> 00:42:27,818
How about...

506
00:42:29,067 --> 00:42:31,621
you set me free and we see if
you can really handle me in a fight?

507
00:42:31,714 --> 00:42:32,728
What?

508
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:34,713
A fight?!

509
00:42:38,062 --> 00:42:40,582
Ahh... Look at this crazy brat...

510
00:42:40,772 --> 00:42:43,152
You never fail to amaze me.

511
00:42:43,369 --> 00:42:46,080
You act just like your moth...

512
00:42:47,328 --> 00:42:48,506
What?

513
00:42:49,741 --> 00:42:51,544
Forget it.

514
00:42:52,594 --> 00:42:55,694
Even that info means money to me.

515
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:57,579
Can't let it out of the oven so easily.

516
00:42:57,679 --> 00:42:59,953
What are you trying to say?

517
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:03,884
All you need to do is follow my orders.

518
00:43:04,117 --> 00:43:04,870
Are we clear?

519
00:43:04,926 --> 00:43:07,845
Spare me all that bullshit.

520
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:11,407
Think Director Yoo will do as you say?

521
00:43:11,762 --> 00:43:13,550
Dream on.

522
00:43:14,231 --> 00:43:18,077
She has no reason 
to exchange me with money.

523
00:43:20,915 --> 00:43:23,381
Miss Hwang Jeongyeon...

524
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,951
There is something you don't...

525
00:43:26,205 --> 00:43:29,194
No, something you shouldn't know.

526
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:31,073
And what the hell is that?

527
00:43:31,328 --> 00:43:33,001
You really...

528
00:43:34,081 --> 00:43:36,495
Who are you screaming at?

529
00:43:36,635 --> 00:43:38,150
Hey.

530
00:43:38,973 --> 00:43:41,581
I'm much scarier than you think.

531
00:43:41,694 --> 00:43:45,605
If I sell you off to Japan, you'll be rotting 
in a room saloon for the rest of your life.

532
00:43:45,731 --> 00:43:47,842
Think I couldn't?

533
00:43:48,864 --> 00:43:53,640
I'll go get the phone,
so don't make another scene,

534
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,128
and just beg them to save you.

535
00:44:03,025 --> 00:44:07,864
Think that it's the only way
you'll get out of here alive,

536
00:44:08,008 --> 00:44:11,429
and give it your best.

537
00:44:18,709 --> 00:44:21,391
You fuc...

538
00:44:30,848 --> 00:44:34,717
<i>A reservoir three hours from Seoul.</i>

539
00:44:34,973 --> 00:44:38,294
A reservoir three hours from Seoul...

540
00:44:43,254 --> 00:44:45,027
Jeongyeon.

541
00:44:46,461 --> 00:44:48,944
Hang in there a little longer.

542
00:44:49,384 --> 00:44:51,271
Whatever it takes,

543
00:44:51,499 --> 00:44:53,570
I'll come get you.

544
00:45:21,891 --> 00:45:24,156
Gangmo...

545
00:45:28,739 --> 00:45:31,935
Are you asking me to arrest Cha Bucheol?

546
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:35,623
He abducted Hwang Jeongyeon.

547
00:45:36,687 --> 00:45:40,657
He'll soon get a pledge and
that IOU list from Yoo Gyeongok.

548
00:45:40,768 --> 00:45:42,782
You just need to get your hands on that.

549
00:45:42,876 --> 00:45:46,663
What would you do with
that pledge and the IOU list?

550
00:45:46,848 --> 00:45:49,587
There's this private lender 
called Noh Gapsoo.

551
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:52,012
With Baekpa out of the picture,

552
00:45:52,198 --> 00:45:56,313
he's virtually fighting Yoo Gyeongok
with the entire organization at stake.

553
00:45:56,782 --> 00:46:00,593
I'm just trying to tread in his path.

554
00:46:00,704 --> 00:46:06,443
So you'll try to gain control 
of the private lending...

555
00:46:06,552 --> 00:46:07,989
<i>That's exactly it.</i>

556
00:46:08,112 --> 00:46:11,435
The more you learn about the underground
market, the more alluring it becomes.

557
00:46:11,533 --> 00:46:13,329
It's even a little intimidating.

558
00:46:13,432 --> 00:46:19,783
And if we lose this opportunity, 
it will be hard to get another one.

559
00:46:19,906 --> 00:46:21,599
I understand what you mean.

560
00:46:21,685 --> 00:46:24,492
But there's a problem.

561
00:46:25,112 --> 00:46:31,072
Lee Gangmo is on a rampage
trying to find Cha Bucheol.

562
00:46:31,654 --> 00:46:35,116
We can't allow him to
rescue Hwang Jeongyeon.

563
00:46:35,212 --> 00:46:36,521
Is that clear?

564
00:46:36,619 --> 00:46:40,440
You must find Cha Bucheol first, 
and bring him to me.

565
00:46:40,610 --> 00:46:41,873
All right.

566
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:46,017
Jaechun will help you.

567
00:46:47,322 --> 00:46:48,878
I can handle it by myself.

568
00:46:49,076 --> 00:46:50,904
I know how busy you are these days.

569
00:46:51,016 --> 00:46:54,014
If you join forces with Jaechun, 
it'll be much easier.

570
00:46:54,199 --> 00:46:59,422
Let's join forces like
back in the KCIA days, Seongmo.

571
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:10,576
So this heat exchanger helps the
gas combustion, and turns it into heat?

572
00:47:10,718 --> 00:47:13,133
Didn't I explain it to you already?

573
00:47:13,228 --> 00:47:16,305
Ahh... How could telling me 
only once do it?

574
00:47:16,425 --> 00:47:18,816
So let's hear it in detail, 
while you're at it.

575
00:47:18,928 --> 00:47:20,064
Let's just forget it.

576
00:47:20,172 --> 00:47:23,260
It's not like it'd help us find
the cause of those accidents.

577
00:47:23,473 --> 00:47:25,693
Wait... What...

578
00:47:25,894 --> 00:47:28,425
Ahh... Look at him.

579
00:47:28,837 --> 00:47:32,074
It's just his temper...
He's not a bad person.

580
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:33,523
I'll explain it to you one more time.

581
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,943
Aigoo... Like I don't have a temper?

582
00:47:38,124 --> 00:47:40,811
But, where is everyone?

583
00:47:40,976 --> 00:47:43,897
- Where did the president go?
- Don't even get me started.

584
00:47:44,023 --> 00:47:47,192
Those boilers aren't the only
thing that's about to explode.

585
00:47:48,004 --> 00:47:51,123
And what is that supposed to mean?

586
00:47:51,634 --> 00:47:53,085
We got a call from the research lab,

587
00:47:53,198 --> 00:47:56,601
and right as you suggested, 
gas was the problem.

588
00:47:57,494 --> 00:47:59,737
When will you be able to get your
hands on Beaute's core technology?

589
00:47:59,856 --> 00:48:03,288
He said it would take until
about the end of next week.

590
00:48:03,402 --> 00:48:05,441
Tell him to hurry up.

591
00:48:05,824 --> 00:48:07,286
Now that they're running around aimlessly,

592
00:48:07,428 --> 00:48:10,660
it's the perfect opportunity to beat
them to it and develop our own boilers.

593
00:48:10,958 --> 00:48:13,781
Generously fund the boiler
research team from Hanguk University.

594
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:15,622
All right, Chairman.

595
00:48:21,261 --> 00:48:22,486
Yes.

596
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:26,511
<i>Your mother is in the hospital,
and you don't even pay her a visit?</i>

597
00:48:27,732 --> 00:48:29,602
Of all places, why that hospital?

598
00:48:29,774 --> 00:48:30,826
<i>Uh?!</i>

599
00:48:30,939 --> 00:48:34,700
<i>Because I heard this place 
is best when it comes to joints.</i>

600
00:48:34,969 --> 00:48:39,071
You can do whatever you want,
but I won't marry that woman.

601
00:48:39,534 --> 00:48:41,473
And who ever asked you to marry her?

602
00:48:41,565 --> 00:48:43,718
I just want to see you, that's all.

603
00:48:43,862 --> 00:48:44,763
<i>Mom.</i>

604
00:48:44,861 --> 00:48:48,020
Ehh... No excuses.
Just come visit me.

605
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:51,004
Always talking so much...

606
00:48:52,419 --> 00:48:54,809
Aigoo... Come on in, Doctor Yoo.

607
00:48:56,590 --> 00:49:02,708
So how about that meeting,
was my Minwoo all right?

608
00:49:04,736 --> 00:49:09,057
While I'm hospitalized here,
I'll tell Minwoo to come,

609
00:49:09,235 --> 00:49:11,626
so give it a try.

610
00:49:12,070 --> 00:49:13,265
Thank you.

611
00:49:13,423 --> 00:49:15,930
Ahh... Right. Mother.

612
00:49:16,143 --> 00:49:21,664
I told my father to entrust his new
heart center to Manbo Construction.

613
00:49:21,767 --> 00:49:26,815
Aigoo... How considerate of you.

614
00:49:29,347 --> 00:49:33,490
It's just that Minwoo is
not too interested in women,

615
00:49:33,647 --> 00:49:39,749
but right after you had that meeting,
he seemed to like you.

616
00:49:45,654 --> 00:49:48,914
Are you all right?

617
00:49:50,021 --> 00:49:52,533
Be careful.

618
00:49:56,989 --> 00:49:58,862
Wooju's mother will soon be here.

619
00:49:58,990 --> 00:50:02,301
Why bother her when she's so busy?

620
00:50:02,868 --> 00:50:07,537
It's not like I'm not used
to joint inflammation by now...

621
00:50:07,763 --> 00:50:09,893
Grandma.

622
00:50:11,326 --> 00:50:13,361
Where have you been?

623
00:50:13,441 --> 00:50:15,756
Grandma, here...

624
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:19,942
Are you helping Grandma get better?

625
00:50:21,645 --> 00:50:24,000
Aigoo, my boy...

626
00:50:24,285 --> 00:50:26,339
Don't you worry.

627
00:50:26,697 --> 00:50:29,694
Grandma is all right.

628
00:51:05,968 --> 00:51:06,795
What?

629
00:51:06,975 --> 00:51:09,053
Help me up, please.

630
00:51:09,203 --> 00:51:10,138
What?

631
00:51:10,296 --> 00:51:13,162
I need to wash my hands.

632
00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:18,073
Please...

633
00:51:32,902 --> 00:51:34,451
Done?

634
00:51:38,765 --> 00:51:40,128
Mom...

635
00:51:40,369 --> 00:51:42,242
You're so busy, why bother...

636
00:51:42,398 --> 00:51:43,763
Again with the inflammation?

637
00:51:43,931 --> 00:51:45,604
They said it's nothing serious.

638
00:51:45,804 --> 00:51:48,443
A little treatment and
I'll get better in no time.

639
00:51:51,815 --> 00:51:53,424
Where is Wooju?

640
00:51:54,298 --> 00:51:55,744
The men's room.

641
00:51:55,959 --> 00:52:00,557
He said he's a man, so there's no way
he's coming to the ladies' room with me.

642
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:33,420
Hey... Kiddo.

643
00:52:34,456 --> 00:52:36,136
You should thank me.

644
00:52:36,343 --> 00:52:38,847
Thank you.

645
00:52:52,264 --> 00:52:53,665
Hi.

646
00:52:54,403 --> 00:52:55,555
Hi.

647
00:52:55,836 --> 00:52:57,349
Is my mother all right?

648
00:52:57,490 --> 00:53:00,255
Yes, she's fine.

649
00:53:01,343 --> 00:53:03,911
I was about to get off...

650
00:53:04,152 --> 00:53:05,262
What?

651
00:53:05,756 --> 00:53:08,594
If you're not busy, 
would you have dinner...

652
00:53:10,625 --> 00:53:14,525
- Then, I'll go see my mother, and...
- Chairman.

653
00:53:14,656 --> 00:53:19,338
We found someone who saw Miju.

654
00:53:21,822 --> 00:53:25,057
I'm sorry.
Let's save it for another day.

655
00:53:27,257 --> 00:53:28,903
Wooju...

656
00:53:29,048 --> 00:53:31,751
Wooju. Kang Wooju!

657
00:53:31,857 --> 00:53:33,771
Wooju?

658
00:53:57,643 --> 00:54:00,415
<i>- Chowon Coffeehouse -</i>

659
00:54:03,083 --> 00:54:05,623
I'll be shooting,
so let's do it in one take.

660
00:54:05,765 --> 00:54:07,411
Are we clear?

661
00:54:13,845 --> 00:54:16,712
Hey... Tie her up again.

662
00:54:17,223 --> 00:54:20,487
Let go... I'll do as he said!

663
00:54:24,602 --> 00:54:26,177
Happy now?

664
00:54:26,291 --> 00:54:27,413
Do you mean it?

665
00:54:27,501 --> 00:54:32,618
I can't allow you 
to sell me off like that.

666
00:54:34,307 --> 00:54:36,771
So we finally start to get it?!

667
00:54:36,868 --> 00:54:38,581
So you'll be shooting a video?

668
00:54:38,676 --> 00:54:41,743
Just do as I say. Sit there.

669
00:54:49,004 --> 00:54:50,892
<i>- Chowon Coffeehouse -</i>

670
00:54:55,944 --> 00:54:58,683
Hey... Go get a pen and some paper.

671
00:54:58,867 --> 00:55:00,277
Yes.

672
00:55:18,354 --> 00:55:22,299
<i>Since you said you'd cooperate,
go ahead and read this.</i>

673
00:55:25,052 --> 00:55:27,067
Here... Let's begin.

674
00:55:28,387 --> 00:55:32,558
Before that, will you give me a cigarette?

675
00:55:33,321 --> 00:55:34,456
You smoke?!

676
00:55:34,598 --> 00:55:37,039
Before I change my mind, do it.

677
00:55:38,625 --> 00:55:40,573
Aigoo...

678
00:55:50,715 --> 00:55:51,760
Hey... Hey.

679
00:55:51,903 --> 00:55:54,691
It's upside down.

680
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:28,082
You're here, Hyung?

681
00:56:28,763 --> 00:56:30,920
Why didn't you tell me?

682
00:56:31,990 --> 00:56:34,042
If I knew you were going
after those abductors,

683
00:56:34,198 --> 00:56:36,345
I would have helped you.

684
00:56:37,069 --> 00:56:39,995
Bucheol knows your face, so I couldn't.

685
00:56:40,744 --> 00:56:42,348
It would get you in danger as well.

686
00:56:42,476 --> 00:56:45,782
I need to catch him as well from now on.

687
00:56:46,662 --> 00:56:48,904
Jo Pilyeon told me.

688
00:56:49,294 --> 00:56:53,867
To catch Cha Bucheol
before you find Hwang Jeongyeon.

689
00:56:54,024 --> 00:56:55,820
What is he scheming?

690
00:56:55,927 --> 00:56:59,005
He wants to gain control
of the private lending market.

691
00:56:59,799 --> 00:57:04,340
In other words, stop Yoo Gyeongok 
and Hwang Jeongyeon...

692
00:57:04,525 --> 00:57:05,965
from gaining any more influence.

693
00:57:06,068 --> 00:57:12,878
Then, can I rest assured 
and work with you on this now?

694
00:57:14,652 --> 00:57:17,036
Go Jaechun will be with me.

695
00:57:17,419 --> 00:57:22,201
He could find out we're brothers, 
if things go wrong.

696
00:57:23,776 --> 00:57:25,633
Jo Pilyeon...

697
00:57:26,024 --> 00:57:27,365
He sure is tenacious.

698
00:57:27,538 --> 00:57:31,324
I'll lead Jaechun astray,

699
00:57:31,537 --> 00:57:36,291
so take the opportunity 
to save Hwang Jeongyeon.

700
00:57:36,830 --> 00:57:38,848
He still hasn't made his move.

701
00:57:39,016 --> 00:57:40,924
He will soon.

702
00:57:42,116 --> 00:57:44,146
That's how abductions work.

703
00:57:44,586 --> 00:57:47,963
In the end, they'll be the ones 
to make the first move.

704
00:57:50,404 --> 00:57:52,794
Miju's live performance is this weekend.

705
00:57:52,958 --> 00:57:53,897
You'll come, right?

706
00:57:53,975 --> 00:57:55,615
Of course.

707
00:57:55,811 --> 00:57:58,167
We'll need to cheer her on.

708
00:58:02,339 --> 00:58:04,567
Don't you worry about this.

709
00:58:05,730 --> 00:58:12,182
Until he gains what he wants,
he won't touch Jeongyeon.

710
00:58:15,787 --> 00:58:17,036
<i>Gangmo.</i>

711
00:58:17,135 --> 00:58:18,623
Gangmo.

712
00:58:21,236 --> 00:58:23,151
Gangmo...

713
00:58:23,691 --> 00:58:25,948
They...

714
00:58:27,097 --> 00:58:32,674
sent us a tape with Jeongyeon in it.

715
00:58:53,098 --> 00:58:55,213
<i>If you don't listen to these people,</i>

716
00:58:55,392 --> 00:58:58,207
they might kill me.

717
00:58:59,385 --> 00:59:01,228
Please help me.

718
00:59:01,526 --> 00:59:04,549
Give them what they ask.

719
00:59:17,103 --> 00:59:19,316
You have three days.

720
00:59:19,615 --> 00:59:24,922
If you don't send them that pledge
and the IOU list within three days,

721
00:59:26,355 --> 00:59:28,739
<i>I might die.</i>

722
00:59:34,756 --> 00:59:37,098
Jeongyeon doesn't smoke.

723
00:59:38,999 --> 00:59:43,905
She tried to send us some kind of signal.

724
00:59:44,015 --> 00:59:45,371
Rewind the tape.

725
00:59:49,429 --> 00:59:51,015
Stop!

726
00:59:57,051 --> 00:59:59,080
<i>That matchbox.</i>

727
00:59:59,632 --> 01:00:02,047
Chowon... Coffeehouse. Right?

728
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:04,603
Ohh... Yeah... Looks like it.

729
01:00:04,698 --> 01:00:06,580
How about the phone number?

730
01:00:06,765 --> 01:00:09,901
I can only see the area code?

731
01:00:10,185 --> 01:00:11,393
What's the area code?

732
01:00:11,604 --> 01:00:14,002
Starts with 0443.

733
01:00:18,330 --> 01:00:21,222
<i>{\a6}*national phone directory</i>

734
01:00:18,330 --> 01:00:21,222
<i>Yes, 114* speaking.
How may I help you?</i>

735
01:00:21,705 --> 01:00:26,134
Yes... Could you please tell me
the number for Chowon Coffeehouse?

736
01:00:26,258 --> 01:00:29,169
<i>Just a moment, please.</i>

737
01:00:34,733 --> 01:00:37,261
You will meet an important
person coming from the east,

738
01:00:37,354 --> 01:00:39,849
but the sun will set
and the path is still long.

739
01:00:39,955 --> 01:00:43,717
Hey... Must be east, then.
That reservoir is there.

740
01:00:43,915 --> 01:00:47,846
East or west, let's first check
the reservoir nearby.

741
01:00:47,988 --> 01:00:49,657
There must be some
kind of villa around here.

742
01:00:49,767 --> 01:00:54,503
If we react carelessly,
they could spot us.

743
01:00:55,866 --> 01:00:58,425
And we don't even know how
many people we'll be dealing with.

744
01:00:58,535 --> 01:01:01,139
So, what, are we just going to sit here?

745
01:01:01,329 --> 01:01:04,543
They'll come here for sure.

746
01:01:04,634 --> 01:01:07,087
Even if they do,
how will we recognize them?

747
01:01:07,194 --> 01:01:09,407
We only know Bucheol's face.

748
01:01:14,328 --> 01:01:16,556
<i>Coffee for three.</i>

749
01:01:33,211 --> 01:01:33,948
Gangmo!

750
01:01:34,019 --> 01:01:36,570
You dare bite me?

751
01:01:42,867 --> 01:01:44,523
Listen.

752
01:01:44,967 --> 01:01:46,964
Are those people regulars?

753
01:01:47,068 --> 01:01:49,286
They come pretty often these days.

754
01:01:49,551 --> 01:01:51,481
What kind of people are they?

755
01:01:52,729 --> 01:01:54,618
Gangsters.

756
01:01:54,783 --> 01:01:57,338
You can't imagine how annoying they are.

757
01:02:00,403 --> 01:02:02,815
Wait here just a moment.

758
01:02:12,422 --> 01:02:14,854
Ahh... I'm sorry.

759
01:02:15,090 --> 01:02:19,673
Hey... Did you leave your eyes at home?

760
01:02:20,284 --> 01:02:21,451
I apologize.

761
01:02:21,589 --> 01:02:22,526
I should have been more careful.

762
01:02:22,639 --> 01:02:24,294
- I ought to...
- Hey.

763
01:02:24,384 --> 01:02:26,363
Stop.

764
01:02:28,114 --> 01:02:33,742
Pay for the dry cleaner's,
and get the fuck out.

765
01:02:47,164 --> 01:02:50,485
Don't ever do anything you'll
have to feel sorry about again.

766
