5
00:00:12,864 --> 00:00:15,998
- All right!
- Wait! Wait a moment.

6
00:00:17,062 --> 00:00:18,868
Jeongyeon, quick.

7
00:00:21,177 --> 00:00:22,582
All right.

8
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,798
We made it.

9
00:00:34,942 --> 00:00:36,950
Jeongyeon, are you okay?

10
00:00:39,867 --> 00:00:42,398
Girls with no prudence...

11
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:44,832
What?

12
00:00:45,761 --> 00:00:47,575
What did you just say?

13
00:00:47,683 --> 00:00:49,713
Girls with no what?!

14
00:00:49,822 --> 00:00:52,426
When you wear a skirt,
you should be careful.

15
00:00:52,607 --> 00:00:56,065
I bet all the boys here 
saw your panties.

16
00:00:59,401 --> 00:01:01,244
You saw them too, didn't you?

17
00:01:03,443 --> 00:01:06,649
Seeing you get all red, 
must be right.

18
00:01:09,691 --> 00:01:10,885
You.

19
00:01:11,103 --> 00:01:13,528
If you don't want a beating,
keep your mouth shut.

20
00:01:15,924 --> 00:01:18,336
A beating from who, you?

21
00:01:31,347 --> 00:01:32,849
<i>Teacher's coming!</i>

22
00:01:40,828 --> 00:01:42,392
Attention.

23
00:01:43,861 --> 00:01:44,887
Salute your professor.

24
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,594
Good morning, Professor.

25
00:01:46,715 --> 00:01:47,958
Right.

26
00:01:48,057 --> 00:01:49,222
He's in our class?!

27
00:01:49,343 --> 00:01:51,444
<i>Before we go ahead 
with the monthly finals,</i>

28
00:01:51,577 --> 00:01:53,720
I have a new friend to introduce.

29
00:01:54,338 --> 00:01:56,499
- Introduce yourself.
- Yes.

30
00:01:59,775 --> 00:02:01,653
I'm Lee Gangmo.

31
00:02:01,983 --> 00:02:04,090
Nice to meet you all.

32
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:13,948
Let's see...
Right.

33
00:02:14,057 --> 00:02:16,426
There's an empty seat 
right next to Sideok.

34
00:02:16,585 --> 00:02:19,050
- Go and have a seat.
- Yes.

35
00:02:30,237 --> 00:02:32,278
Put your schoolbags down.

36
00:02:32,545 --> 00:02:36,317
Didn't I tell you not to put your
schoolbags on your desk during my tests?

37
00:02:36,607 --> 00:02:38,509
Put them down.

38
00:02:39,066 --> 00:02:41,209
Don't do it.

39
00:02:45,742 --> 00:02:49,927
To ensure this test is fair, I believe 
we should keep schoolbags on our desk.

40
00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:52,155
We're also testing one's honesty today.

41
00:02:52,266 --> 00:02:56,108
What the finals do is not testing
our honesty, but rating our performance.

42
00:02:56,356 --> 00:03:02,925
In the interest of fairness, I'd like you 
to keep this rule for all other classes.

43
00:03:05,335 --> 00:03:09,283
<i>Everyone with a clean conscience
can put their schoolbag down,</i>

44
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,168
while the rest can go on as usual.

45
00:03:25,886 --> 00:03:27,048
Other than Lee Gangmo,

46
00:03:27,182 --> 00:03:30,807
is there no one else who
doesn't doubt his honesty?

47
00:03:33,152 --> 00:03:34,207
Fine.

48
00:03:34,302 --> 00:03:37,242
Here...
Front row, pass down the test.

49
00:04:46,322 --> 00:04:47,981
Director, a call for you.

50
00:04:48,102 --> 00:04:48,866
Who is it?

51
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:50,367
A certain Jo Pilyeon.

52
00:04:50,461 --> 00:04:51,470
Who did you say?

53
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:53,559
Jo Pilyeon.

54
00:04:56,712 --> 00:04:57,813
Tell him I'm away.

55
00:04:57,884 --> 00:05:00,005
- What?
- Tell him I'm away.

56
00:05:00,098 --> 00:05:02,126
But I said you were here?!

57
00:05:02,221 --> 00:05:05,510
- Tell him I just left, then.
- Yes, Director.

58
00:05:05,765 --> 00:05:07,274
Wait... Wait.

59
00:05:07,368 --> 00:05:08,356
Yes.

60
00:05:08,477 --> 00:05:11,533
From now on, 
whenever Jo Pilyeon calls,

61
00:05:11,691 --> 00:05:13,172
always tell him I'm away.

62
00:05:13,277 --> 00:05:14,149
Is that clear?

63
00:05:14,246 --> 00:05:15,687
Yes, I will.

64
00:05:17,289 --> 00:05:18,319
Listen.

65
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:21,089
Start with a dike behind that area,

66
00:05:21,194 --> 00:05:23,451
and then begin filling from there.

67
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:26,092
Also, about that 
drainage there on the west,

68
00:05:26,182 --> 00:05:28,227
we need to rush with that.

69
00:05:29,776 --> 00:05:31,390
<i>He's not in?</i>

70
00:05:33,969 --> 00:05:36,113
Didn't you just tell me he was?

71
00:05:37,965 --> 00:05:38,834
Look...

72
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:41,232
Are you trying to fool around with me?

73
00:05:44,102 --> 00:05:45,262
All right.

74
00:05:45,376 --> 00:05:48,801
When he comes back, tell him I called.

75
00:06:05,504 --> 00:06:09,816
While I'm away at the meeting,
start by reading this.

76
00:06:10,736 --> 00:06:14,150
It is required knowledge
for every KCIA employee.

77
00:06:24,373 --> 00:06:26,400
<i>A treat is in order, I guess.</i>

78
00:06:26,521 --> 00:06:29,549
We won't make you wait.

79
00:06:32,371 --> 00:06:34,272
Aren't you Min Honggi?

80
00:06:34,443 --> 00:06:39,031
How long has it been since you
enrolled as my aide, about a decade?

81
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:43,258
Anyhow, I'm happy 
to meet you again here.

82
00:06:43,495 --> 00:06:47,389
Only your superiors decide
when to shake hands.

83
00:06:49,926 --> 00:06:52,100
Now that you're a KCIA agent,

84
00:06:52,247 --> 00:06:56,109
shouldn't you at least know
who's your direct superior?

85
00:06:58,882 --> 00:07:00,165
Whatever the case...

86
00:07:00,307 --> 00:07:03,544
Welcome to the Inspection Department.

87
00:07:04,129 --> 00:07:07,637
I apologize for my negligence.

88
00:07:09,502 --> 00:07:11,658
- Let's go.
- Yes.

89
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,682
You petty privy council prick.

90
00:07:28,827 --> 00:07:31,467
I had to write a letter 
of apology because of you!

91
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,896
I will rectify my mistakes!

92
00:07:32,977 --> 00:07:34,817
Rectify?!

93
00:07:40,564 --> 00:07:42,301
<i>Unless you want to die under my watch,</i>

94
00:07:42,422 --> 00:07:44,316
ask for a transfer immediately.

95
00:07:44,394 --> 00:07:45,644
Uh?

96
00:07:45,837 --> 00:07:50,669
I want no hindrances like you 
on my way to a promotion!

97
00:07:51,945 --> 00:07:55,615
You prick...

98
00:08:10,193 --> 00:08:12,469
The presidential elections
are right around the corner.

99
00:08:12,736 --> 00:08:15,596
While all those students and
opposition forces keep prancing around...

100
00:08:15,751 --> 00:08:18,900
prattling about military dictatorship,
what are you people doing to stop them?

101
00:08:19,094 --> 00:08:22,476
The situation is too delicate to do anything
without risking serious repercussions.

102
00:08:22,553 --> 00:08:25,179
That's something the police or
the prosecutor's office could say.

103
00:08:25,252 --> 00:08:26,486
But who are we?

104
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:27,956
We're the KCIA.

105
00:08:28,043 --> 00:08:29,790
The same intelligence agency
working in the shadows,

106
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:31,960
influencing what goes on in the open.

107
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:35,807
Anyhow, if this election fails,

108
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:38,916
we will bear the grunt as well.

109
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:40,196
Got it?

110
00:08:41,591 --> 00:08:43,795
Control the press thoroughly,

111
00:08:43,887 --> 00:08:46,197
and arrest all those demonstrators!

112
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,017
Director.

113
00:08:49,251 --> 00:08:51,455
I have something to tell you.

114
00:08:54,178 --> 00:08:55,398
<i>What is it?</i>

115
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:58,916
Our most recent acquisition, 
Chief Jo Pilyeon,

116
00:08:59,048 --> 00:09:01,747
requested special employment
for two of his collaborators.

117
00:09:03,945 --> 00:09:04,944
And?

118
00:09:05,218 --> 00:09:07,601
<i>{\a6}*table of organization</i>

119
00:09:05,218 --> 00:09:07,601
As our department's TO* 
is already complete,

120
00:09:07,688 --> 00:09:08,953
we cannot accept them.

121
00:09:09,047 --> 00:09:12,558
I already received the
director's consent on the matter.

122
00:09:12,696 --> 00:09:14,401
The Inspection Department
is under my jurisdiction.

123
00:09:14,491 --> 00:09:17,112
Just give them two posts 
and get it over with!

124
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:25,614
If you insist, I will first verify
their abilities and disposition.

125
00:09:26,115 --> 00:09:28,408
You want them to go through a test?

126
00:09:28,515 --> 00:09:29,973
I cannot assent to that.

127
00:09:30,134 --> 00:09:31,947
I believe the director's 
consent is more than...

128
00:09:32,042 --> 00:09:34,021
<i>Listen, Chief Jo!</i>

129
00:09:34,242 --> 00:09:37,898
Where do you think you are, 
some neighborhood council accepting everyone?

130
00:09:38,418 --> 00:09:41,009
If we end up employing people who don't 
have what it takes and then they fail,

131
00:09:41,132 --> 00:09:42,796
will you take responsibility for that?

132
00:09:42,909 --> 00:09:45,236
- But...
- Give it a rest!

133
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:50,616
What he says is right.

134
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:53,052
Have them go through a test first.

135
00:10:08,832 --> 00:10:12,246
You've worked hard on your test today.

136
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:13,850
Dismissed.

137
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,039
Attention.

138
00:10:16,132 --> 00:10:17,443
No need.

139
00:10:25,064 --> 00:10:26,143
Just sit.

140
00:10:26,223 --> 00:10:28,204
It's not over yet.

141
00:10:32,033 --> 00:10:37,389
As usual, we will assign cleaning
and other chores based on test grades.

142
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:40,637
<i>The last ten from the bottom 
will clean the toilets,</i>

143
00:10:40,736 --> 00:10:42,760
the next ten will 
take care of schoolrooms,

144
00:10:42,883 --> 00:10:44,623
and the next ten the garden.

145
00:10:44,755 --> 00:10:46,125
Everyone else who 
didn't make the Top 10...

146
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,809
will be on duty in turns.

147
00:10:47,884 --> 00:10:51,982
I totally flunked the test...
Guess it's the toilets, again.

148
00:10:52,055 --> 00:10:55,869
Why is he deciding that
instead of our teachers?

149
00:10:55,975 --> 00:10:59,453
The class president is
scarier than any teacher.

150
00:10:59,543 --> 00:11:01,213
<i>Over there.</i>

151
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:06,257
You're new, so help out with the
cleaning until grades are announced.

152
00:11:06,928 --> 00:11:09,718
Jeongshik will be in charge
of inspecting your work.

153
00:11:09,939 --> 00:11:12,914
Does the teacher even
know you're doing this?

154
00:11:15,401 --> 00:11:18,720
You're basically forcing those
with bad grades to clean all year long.

155
00:11:18,809 --> 00:11:23,646
So, what, the rest can go on doing nothing 
and focusing only on studying?

156
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:25,285
This is unfair.

157
00:11:25,379 --> 00:11:27,297
That little...

158
00:11:27,795 --> 00:11:29,251
These are class rules.

159
00:11:29,374 --> 00:11:31,246
And who made them?

160
00:11:31,388 --> 00:11:34,178
You did, so that you and a few
other people could have it easy.

161
00:11:34,254 --> 00:11:36,362
Won't you shut that trap?

162
00:11:37,062 --> 00:11:39,177
Stop, Gangmo.

163
00:11:41,011 --> 00:11:43,404
We're the top-ranked freshman

164
00:11:43,688 --> 00:11:46,165
Who do you think made that possible?

165
00:11:46,453 --> 00:11:48,117
If we helped raise their average,

166
00:11:48,183 --> 00:11:49,933
those who are hopeless at studying...

167
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:51,663
should at least show some courtesy 
and do the cleaning.

168
00:11:51,767 --> 00:11:55,815
We don't come to school
to look after people like you.

169
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,896
That little prick...

170
00:11:57,981 --> 00:11:59,261
You fools!

171
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:01,666
Are you going to start cleaning or what?

172
00:12:09,544 --> 00:12:11,086
<i>So?!</i>

173
00:12:14,774 --> 00:12:17,004
Are your parents doing well?

174
00:12:17,093 --> 00:12:20,275
They still talk about you.

175
00:12:24,306 --> 00:12:27,360
But why are you so scared
of the class president?

176
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,511
He's top of the entire school.

177
00:12:30,662 --> 00:12:32,724
His father is a big shot,

178
00:12:32,837 --> 00:12:37,358
<i>not to mention that all the good
fighters in school are Minwoo's lackeys.</i>

179
00:12:37,455 --> 00:12:41,307
Make just a wrong step, and they
might take you to a quiet place...

180
00:12:52,175 --> 00:12:55,851
You seem to love yapping non-stop?

181
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:01,099
You dare question the class president?

00:14:10,195 --> 00:14:11,264
Here...

185
00:14:11,485 --> 00:14:13,004
Give me one as well.

186
00:14:13,175 --> 00:14:14,659
Go ahead.

187
00:14:16,211 --> 00:14:17,021
Why?

188
00:14:17,119 --> 00:14:19,540
Afraid my parents will kick you out?

189
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,951
<i>Do you know what he used to do 
before joining our school?</i>

190
00:14:22,112 --> 00:14:23,528
Ever heard this on the street?

191
00:14:23,606 --> 00:14:26,896
"Shoe shine! Shoe shine!"

192
00:14:27,911 --> 00:14:30,455
He can't move a finger against me.

193
00:14:30,552 --> 00:14:31,913
Wanna see?

194
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,760
<i>See?</i>

195
00:14:36,869 --> 00:14:38,982
He's our little servant.

196
00:14:39,143 --> 00:14:40,287
Tell them yourself.

197
00:14:40,394 --> 00:14:42,660
You're our servant, right?

198
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:47,194
Ohh! Do I see a fist?!

199
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,415
You want to hit me back?

200
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:51,317
Here... Be my guest.

201
00:14:51,449 --> 00:14:53,010
Go ahead.

202
00:15:20,226 --> 00:15:23,885
From 11 to 13, they're all wrong?!

203
00:15:24,093 --> 00:15:25,133
What?

204
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:29,110
Still, you got the last
and most difficult one right.

205
00:15:29,427 --> 00:15:31,232
It's correct.

206
00:15:54,018 --> 00:15:56,080
Nuna, wait a moment.

207
00:16:07,064 --> 00:16:09,190
What are you waiting for?

208
00:16:09,932 --> 00:16:11,657
<i>All right.</i>

209
00:16:24,489 --> 00:16:26,020
What are you doing?

210
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,867

213
00:17:06,338 --> 00:17:07,564
Remember Min Honggi?

214
00:17:07,668 --> 00:17:10,363
He was under my command back
in my tactical division days.

215
00:17:10,909 --> 00:17:11,980
Yes.

216
00:17:12,387 --> 00:17:15,005
He's become our superior now.

217
00:17:15,771 --> 00:17:19,402
You and him have never
seen eye to eye, if I recall?

218
00:17:19,724 --> 00:17:24,336
He's interfering with my work 
every step of the way.

219
00:17:25,649 --> 00:17:27,447
Before your transfer is accepted,

220
00:17:27,636 --> 00:17:30,558
Chief Min will put you through a few tests.

221
00:17:30,691 --> 00:17:32,525
<i>You must pass them at all cost.</i>

222
00:17:32,658 --> 00:17:36,140
Only then will you 
be accepted by the KCIA.

223
00:17:36,709 --> 00:17:39,090
By tests, what is he talking about?

224
00:17:39,222 --> 00:17:43,856
They'll test your aptitude,
skills and temperament.

225
00:17:44,008 --> 00:17:45,719
It won't be easy.

226
00:17:48,075 --> 00:17:50,910
Did Director Hwang call me?

227
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:56,958
No, I think he's trying 
to avoid you on purpose.

228
00:18:00,096 --> 00:18:04,124
Seems like they're all
messing with me, in and out.

229
00:18:06,327 --> 00:18:11,258
So I hear that ever since 
briquette ash was used,

230
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:15,457
the landfill operations have been
proceeding at a much faster pace?

231
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:16,544
Yes.

232
00:18:16,667 --> 00:18:18,810
It is all thanks to you.

233
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:22,102
The mayor expressed 
his satisfaction as well.

234
00:18:22,317 --> 00:18:28,961
And about that favor I asked you, 
how did it go?

235
00:18:29,869 --> 00:18:34,749
About the new government building,

236
00:18:34,862 --> 00:18:38,307
and using lots from 
Manbo Construction for the project.

237
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,275
Well...

238
00:18:42,895 --> 00:18:45,330
I did give it a try,

239
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:47,372
but nothing is certain as of yet.

240
00:18:47,476 --> 00:18:48,620
Commissioner.

241
00:18:48,989 --> 00:18:51,275
You must make it happen.

242
00:18:51,577 --> 00:18:54,499
It might sound like I'm
singing my own praises,

243
00:18:54,613 --> 00:18:59,341
but the fact that I am responsible for
solving the landfill issue is hard to deny.

244
00:19:00,167 --> 00:19:01,803
Yes, I certainly would agree, but...

245
00:19:01,879 --> 00:19:02,598
Commissioner.

246
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:05,293
If you just consider the
best position for that building,

247
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:07,723
there is no place like Banpo.

248
00:19:07,827 --> 00:19:10,631
The final decision is not up to me,

249
00:19:10,778 --> 00:19:14,404
but to Congressman Oh Byeongtak 
of the Republican Party.

250
00:19:14,858 --> 00:19:15,757
Commissioner.

251
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:17,440
Set up a meeting with him.

252
00:19:17,544 --> 00:19:20,982
I will ask him firsthand.

253
00:19:21,814 --> 00:19:24,396
I don't have the power to do so, yet.

254
00:19:24,783 --> 00:19:27,377
I'll make a suggestion
when the opportunity arises,

255
00:19:27,472 --> 00:19:29,158
so let's be a little more patient.

256
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:34,926
But if the contract ends up 
going to someone else...

257
00:19:42,433 --> 00:19:43,426
Congressman.

258
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,222
Have a drink.

259
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:51,128
Director Hong has been generously
funding our National Development plan.

260
00:19:51,242 --> 00:19:53,246
Is that so?

261
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,613
I just feel sorry it's
not as much as I wished.

262
00:19:56,774 --> 00:19:58,031
Nah, don't say that.

263
00:19:58,154 --> 00:20:02,904
It's exactly that patriotic fervor
of yours which matters the most.

264
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:04,852
I agree.

265
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:08,351
I know how hard it must be
for the president and his confidants,

266
00:20:08,446 --> 00:20:13,400
as the elections 
are rapidly approaching us.

267
00:20:13,532 --> 00:20:15,433
<i>Once the landfill project is complete,</i>

268
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:18,317
I plan to devote as much of that land 
as the country requires,

269
00:20:18,412 --> 00:20:20,691
through cost substitution.

270
00:20:21,731 --> 00:20:22,989
Cost substitution?!

271
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,319
Do you mean that?

272
00:20:24,394 --> 00:20:27,950
How could I dare lie to you?

273
00:20:28,793 --> 00:20:30,985
<i>If you put that land to good use,</i>

274
00:20:31,099 --> 00:20:37,028
then you will secure enough funds
to make my donations seem insignificant.

275
00:20:37,217 --> 00:20:43,203
I've never seen an entrepreneur
with such patriotic mindset before.

276
00:20:43,326 --> 00:20:44,749
I really appreciate it, Director Hong.

277
00:20:44,862 --> 00:20:47,283
Here, let me pour you a drink.

278
00:20:48,592 --> 00:20:51,732
If you'll excuse me, I'll get going.

279
00:20:51,855 --> 00:20:53,978
Why? Let's have another few drinks.

280
00:20:54,084 --> 00:20:57,558
No. Go ahead and enjoy yourselves.

281
00:21:18,728 --> 00:21:20,591
It's Goryeo celadon.

282
00:21:20,913 --> 00:21:24,768
You'd be able to buy three-four good
houses within the four major gates...

283
00:21:24,865 --> 00:21:27,089
by selling this kind of item.

284
00:21:27,496 --> 00:21:31,543
I believe treasures should be 
in the custody of people who deserve them.

285
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:35,145
I'd like you to have it.

286
00:21:37,216 --> 00:21:41,870
I still eat with brass bowls.

287
00:21:42,031 --> 00:21:44,896
You never know when 
my temper might explode,

288
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:46,362
<i>so take this back.</i>

289
00:21:46,447 --> 00:21:47,430
Congressman.

290
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:48,490
I actually...

291
00:21:48,556 --> 00:21:51,446
Ohh Ohh! Keep up with this 
and you'll ruin the mood.

292
00:21:51,552 --> 00:21:54,007
Let's wrap things up for today.

293
00:21:58,935 --> 00:22:01,911
He wouldn't bleed 
even if you stabbed him...

294
00:22:02,021 --> 00:22:03,974
If we want to have them choose us 
for the government building project,

295
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,620
we need to change our plans.

296
00:22:05,743 --> 00:22:07,227
What should I do with the celadon?

297
00:22:07,313 --> 00:22:08,868
Change it with cash.

298
00:22:08,962 --> 00:22:10,513
If Oh is such an impregnable fortress,

299
00:22:10,645 --> 00:22:13,652
we need to first win over
all the confidants around him.

300

You call these grades?

307

Still, he gained one spot
compared to last time.

308
00:22:46,042 --> 00:22:48,898
Is that something to be proud of?

309
00:22:49,391 --> 00:22:52,906
Who on earth does he take after, 
with those grades?

310
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:54,282
Who else?

311
00:22:54,381 --> 00:22:57,559
When he was born, you were all ecstatic
saying he was your spitting image.

312
00:22:57,672 --> 00:23:01,313
He should resemble my brains.

You took the test as well.

325
00:23:33,881 --> 00:23:38,130

- Just a waste of money educating him, I guess.

326
00:23:38,272 --> 00:23:42,007
Even on my worst day, 
I never went below 300th place...

327
00:23:42,121 --> 00:23:43,960
<i>Shut your mouth!</i>

328
00:23:45,611 --> 00:23:46,935
You!

329
00:23:47,048 --> 00:23:50,303
Next time, end within the top 10.

330
00:23:50,476 --> 00:23:51,333
What?

331
00:23:51,425 --> 00:23:52,235
Dad!

332
00:23:52,329 --> 00:23:55,478
How can one who's dead last 
end up in the top 10?

333
00:23:56,595 --> 00:23:59,008
- Jeongshik, you too!
- What? Me too?!

334
00:23:59,102 --> 00:24:00,887
The both of you,

335
00:24:01,029 --> 00:24:03,166
<i>if you're not in the top 10 next time,</i>

336
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:04,851
I won't send you to school.

337
00:24:04,937 --> 00:24:07,326
You'll just work at the construction site,

338
00:24:07,432 --> 00:24:09,591
so you're warned, you runts.

339
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,720
Hey... You!

340
00:24:23,812 --> 00:24:24,711
What are you doing?

341
00:24:24,815 --> 00:24:26,954
You brat... Not even knocking...

342
00:24:30,623 --> 00:24:32,344
Can't you even sharpen a pencil?

343
00:24:32,458 --> 00:24:34,607
How could you get them all wrong?

344
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,329
If you don't know the answer,
don't write anything.

345
00:24:36,452 --> 00:24:37,653
Why bother sharpening the pencil?

346
00:24:37,786 --> 00:24:40,102
You said you wanted to be friends?

347
00:24:40,263 --> 00:24:43,270
I'm not going to be friends
with someone who's dead last.

348
00:24:43,489 --> 00:24:46,249
I'll give you all these reference books,

349
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:48,496
so start studying.

350
00:24:49,379 --> 00:24:50,979
Your grades got worse, too.

351
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:53,484
I can end on top whenever I want.

352
00:24:53,562 --> 00:24:54,312
You know, don't you?

353
00:24:54,378 --> 00:24:56,714
That I couldn't study
because of my father.

354
00:24:56,865 --> 00:24:58,647
Putting on airs...

355
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,475
You still have the test questions, right?

356
00:25:01,635 --> 00:25:03,101
Solve them all by helping 
yourself with those books,

357
00:25:03,224 --> 00:25:04,813
and write the answers by tomorrow.

358
00:25:04,907 --> 00:25:07,073
What are you, giving me homework?

359
00:25:07,186 --> 00:25:09,178
If you don't get them right,
forget about being friends.

360
00:25:09,329 --> 00:25:11,372
I'll treat you as a servant,
like everyone else does.

361
00:25:11,485 --> 00:25:12,951
So make your choice.

362
00:25:14,747 --> 00:25:16,497
That brat...

363
00:26:19,929 --> 00:26:21,152
Hey.

364
00:26:22,155 --> 00:26:25,360
Keep coming in as you please, will you?

365
00:26:25,805 --> 00:26:27,772
Know how to ride a bicycle?

366
00:26:27,959 --> 00:26:29,205
Uh?!

367
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:39,689
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

368
00:26:40,251 --> 00:26:42,949
- Can't you go a little faster?
- What?

369
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:45,304
Go faster!

370
00:26:45,605 --> 00:26:48,472
- If you fall, then don't complain.
- Faster!

371
00:26:48,566 --> 00:26:50,978
Let's have some fun!

372
00:27:17,106 --> 00:27:18,129
You idiot.

373
00:27:18,226 --> 00:27:20,160
This is wrong.

374
00:27:21,418 --> 00:27:23,354
You still can't do it, 
even with the book?

375
00:27:23,467 --> 00:27:25,198
What are you, blind?

376
00:27:30,739 --> 00:27:32,624
Why didn't you solve the math problems?

377
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:36,654
That wasn't on your reference books.

378
00:27:36,885 --> 00:27:38,299
You dolt...

379
00:27:38,485 --> 00:27:41,328
It's applied math, so just use formulas.

380
00:27:41,417 --> 00:27:43,018
Look.

381
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:50,013
It's asking you to find a common
number between this and this.

382
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:52,093
You then use the 
greatest common denominator,

383
00:27:52,197 --> 00:27:55,124
so 20, 70, 90.

384
00:28:18,144 --> 00:28:19,685
Got it?

385
00:28:23,165 --> 00:28:24,782
Got it or not?

386
00:28:25,675 --> 00:28:26,873
Yeah.

387
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:28,609
So what's the answer?

388
00:28:28,702 --> 00:28:29,218
Uh?!

389
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,199
What's the answer.

390
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:32,206
Answer?

391
00:28:32,934 --> 00:28:36,242
The answer... is...

392
00:28:37,398 --> 00:28:40,167
I explained in detail...
Did you listen or what?

393
00:28:40,266 --> 00:28:41,632
Why do you keep hitting my head?

394
00:28:41,698 --> 00:28:44,856
Why do you keep getting distracted?

395
00:28:45,134 --> 00:28:46,209
<i>Tell me.</i>

396
00:28:46,388 --> 00:28:48,412
What were you thinking about?

397
00:28:52,304 --> 00:28:54,010
This is trouble, really.

398
00:28:54,306 --> 00:28:57,310
How are you going to enter the
Top 10 with that brain of yours?

399
00:28:57,528 --> 00:28:58,489
Don't worry.

400
00:28:58,583 --> 00:29:00,654
I'll end up first.

401
00:29:01,127 --> 00:29:02,668
Really?

402
00:29:03,009 --> 00:29:04,626
You promised.

403
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:06,451
To end up first.

404
00:29:06,895 --> 00:29:08,518
A...All right.

405
00:29:08,641 --> 00:29:11,091
I can just do it and get it over with.

406
00:29:11,197 --> 00:29:13,993
Fine.
I'll believe you.

407
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:16,565
First, solve this one again.

408
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:34,485
You're top of the class again,
so I can't just ignore it.

409
00:29:34,655 --> 00:29:35,814
Tell me.

410
00:29:35,923 --> 00:29:38,362
What present should I get you?

411
00:29:38,523 --> 00:29:40,655
How about raising my allowance?

412
00:29:40,872 --> 00:29:43,558
Why would you need more money?

413
00:29:43,738 --> 00:29:47,265
Know how many kids are following me?

414
00:29:47,405 --> 00:29:48,968
Fine... All right.

415
00:29:49,075 --> 00:29:51,884
A man needs to show leadership.

416
00:29:51,991 --> 00:29:55,173
Still, don't neglect your studies.

417
00:29:55,285 --> 00:29:57,348
Ehh... Don't worry.

418
00:29:57,437 --> 00:30:00,831
I'm confident I'll be first 
the whole three years.

419
00:30:01,417 --> 00:30:04,543
And me? Where is my gift?

420
00:30:04,647 --> 00:30:05,959
And why?

421
00:30:06,222 --> 00:30:09,711
Think looking after Minwoo is that simple?

422
00:30:09,815 --> 00:30:11,745
There are weekly PTA meetings to attend,

423
00:30:11,853 --> 00:30:14,367
his tutor to take care of,
not to mention...

424
00:30:14,463 --> 00:30:15,654
All right, fine.

425
00:30:15,777 --> 00:30:17,602
What do you want?

426
00:30:18,746 --> 00:30:22,364
How about a nice dress?
And shoes to fit.

427
00:30:23,168 --> 00:30:26,128
Listen to you... Why don't you 
just sell me off, then?

428
00:30:26,251 --> 00:30:30,686
Ahh... Really, and how
much would that get me?

429
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:31,884
Isn't that right, Minwoo?

430
00:30:32,016 --> 00:30:34,305
<i>What? What did you just say?</i>

431
00:30:34,409 --> 00:30:36,537
<i>Honey...</i>

432
00:30:54,037 --> 00:30:56,335
You went in my room today, right?

433
00:30:57,545 --> 00:30:59,635
Yeah... Was looking for a book.

434
00:30:59,739 --> 00:31:02,131
Don't enter my room when I'm not home.

435
00:31:03,241 --> 00:31:04,649
Yeah... All right.

436
00:31:04,762 --> 00:31:09,346
Also, I study every evening
from eight till midnight.

437
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:13,065
I'd prefer if you didn't wander
in and out of my room all evening.

438
00:31:14,628 --> 00:31:15,743
And?

439
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:19,970
What else should I do?

440
00:31:20,131 --> 00:31:22,883
At seven in the morning,
for about a half hour,

441
00:31:22,962 --> 00:31:27,496
I need to get ready for school, so limit
your use of the bathroom to the essential.

442
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:30,683
All right.
I'll be careful.

443
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:32,867
Thank you for telling me in advance.

444
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,505
Anything left to say?

445
00:31:43,852 --> 00:31:46,226
You seem like a decent person.

446
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:50,075
I think we'll become closer.

447
00:32:06,992 --> 00:32:08,997
You didn't even have breakfast.

448
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:11,279
Thank you.

449
00:32:13,233 --> 00:32:17,770
No way, I'm not eating.
Send me back to my Mommy.

450
00:32:17,893 --> 00:32:21,430
Mommy...

451
00:32:22,243 --> 00:32:25,118
Fine. Do as you wish.

452
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:29,839
There will be nothing to eat until
the evening, so don't complain later.

453
00:32:36,127 --> 00:32:40,867
Did your mother bring you here?

454
00:32:42,485 --> 00:32:45,946
My mother passed away.
Daddy, too.

455
00:32:46,031 --> 00:32:50,094
Then, you don't have any parents left?

456
00:32:50,189 --> 00:32:52,903
Yeah... But I have brothers.

457
00:32:53,035 --> 00:32:54,444
Brothers?

458
00:32:54,596 --> 00:32:59,198
When I was first brought here,
I refused to eat like you,

459
00:32:59,322 --> 00:33:01,278
and kept crying all the time.

460
00:33:01,448 --> 00:33:03,492
<i>But now I don't cry anymore.</i>

461
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:08,001
I believe my brothers
will come looking for me.

462
00:33:08,304 --> 00:33:10,990
So I eat a lot on purpose?!

463
00:33:11,086 --> 00:33:15,645
So I can brag to them 
about how much I've grown up.

464
00:33:15,805 --> 00:33:18,065
<i>You still have a mother, at least.</i>

465
00:33:18,179 --> 00:33:23,662
If she learns you're 
skipping meals and always cry,

466
00:33:23,766 --> 00:33:26,366
think of how sad she would be.

467
00:33:26,593 --> 00:33:31,615
And if you never eat and don't grow,
she'll probably leave you here?

468
00:33:59,116 --> 00:34:03,116
There is no way to know
how and what he'll be rating.

469
00:34:03,362 --> 00:34:06,341
<i>I can only give you 
two pieces of advice.</i>

470
00:34:06,633 --> 00:34:10,861
One is to never contest an order, 
no matter what it is.

471
00:34:11,657 --> 00:34:14,781
You must follow his
instructions at all cost.

472
00:34:14,913 --> 00:34:17,883
Obedience above everything else.

473
00:34:19,741 --> 00:34:21,900
The other...

474
00:34:22,751 --> 00:34:27,413
is that you must never reveal your identity,
no matter how desperate the situation is.

475
00:34:27,592 --> 00:34:30,448
Keep them in mind, is that clear?

476
00:34:31,744 --> 00:34:33,227
Yes.

477
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,282
Yes, Sir.

478
00:34:38,551 --> 00:34:42,523
I believe in you.

479
00:34:42,735 --> 00:34:46,991
Pass that test at all cost,
and remain by my side.

480
00:35:06,995 --> 00:35:10,873
You can write down your thoughts here.

481
00:35:11,015 --> 00:35:12,869
You have forty-five minutes,

482
00:35:13,029 --> 00:35:15,613
so you won't have too much time 
to waste reflecting.

483
00:35:16,057 --> 00:35:17,797
Begin.

484
00:36:39,454 --> 00:36:41,561
<i>"The grass is lying flat."</i>

485
00:36:42,293 --> 00:36:45,577
"Lying flat quicker than the gentle breeze."

486
00:36:46,336 --> 00:36:49,237
"It weeps louder than the wind,"

487
00:36:49,517 --> 00:36:53,104
"And faster than the wind it rises."

488
00:36:53,738 --> 00:36:57,331
<i>"Clouds caress the sky,
as the grass is lying flat."</i>

489
00:36:57,892 --> 00:36:59,553
<i>"Lying low,"</i>

490
00:37:00,029 --> 00:37:02,040
<i>"Low down to my ankles."</i>

491
00:37:03,184 --> 00:37:05,596
<i>"It might lie after the breeze,"</i>

492
00:37:05,804 --> 00:37:08,319
<i>"Rise before the wind,"</i>

493
00:37:08,471 --> 00:37:11,043
<i>"And might even weep much later,"</i>

494
00:37:11,213 --> 00:37:14,494
"But it is the first to smile."

495
00:37:16,135 --> 00:37:22,083
"Clouds caress the sky,
as the grass is lying flat."

496
00:37:23,066 --> 00:37:27,014
We just read the 
late Kim Suyoung's "Grass."

497
00:37:27,206 --> 00:37:29,548
Anyone cares to share his feelings?

498
00:37:30,483 --> 00:37:34,411
It reminds me of when my father
bought me a sickle to cut the forage.

499
00:37:37,069 --> 00:37:40,745
Resistance against 
oppression and violence,

500
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:44,152
and the poet's love for
freedom dominate this poem.

501
00:37:45,441 --> 00:37:50,548
<i>The world you live in today
is not as fair as you think.</i>

502
00:37:51,068 --> 00:37:53,820
So the reason you study...

503
00:37:54,246 --> 00:37:56,392
<i>is to learn about the world.</i>

504
00:37:56,685 --> 00:37:59,209
<i>Learning what injustice is and
gaining the knowledge to contend with it...</i>

505
00:37:59,351 --> 00:38:01,195
<i>is something you must practice.</i>

506
00:38:01,384 --> 00:38:06,235
<i>That will help you find freedom 
and protect your rights.</i>

507
00:38:07,965 --> 00:38:09,117
It might be a complicated concept,

508
00:38:09,231 --> 00:38:13,940
but one day you will understand
the meaning of today's class.

509
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:18,261
<i>Here... What does the poet
refer to with the word "grass"?</i>

510
00:38:18,942 --> 00:38:21,942
Aigoo... Again here? Again?!

511
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:24,757
- How are you?
- Ohh... It's you.

512
00:38:30,662 --> 00:38:32,475
Seonsaengnim, 
can you help me out with this?

513
00:38:32,589 --> 00:38:34,064
You're here again?

514
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:35,577
Let me have a look.

515
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:38,508
Let your teachers rest
during recess, will you?

516
00:38:38,584 --> 00:38:41,291
You're always here...

517
00:38:41,423 --> 00:38:45,282
If this keeps up, what if Lee Gangmo 
beats Jo Minwoo at the upcoming midterms?

518
00:38:45,414 --> 00:38:47,315
Ehh... What kind of
nonsense are you saying?

519
00:38:47,419 --> 00:38:49,149
He was dead last...

520
00:38:49,253 --> 00:38:51,085
Who could ever know?

521
00:38:51,176 --> 00:38:55,930
During today's class, Gangmo got them
all right, and Minwoo got two wrong.

522
00:38:57,475 --> 00:39:00,881
Remember to tell your mother.

523
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:02,909
I will.

524
00:39:06,039 --> 00:39:09,348
<i>Then, shall we bet on who will
end up first at the next midterms?</i>

525
00:39:09,471 --> 00:39:12,172
<i>I'm banking on Lee Gangmo.</i>

526
00:39:12,333 --> 00:39:13,496
Really?

527
00:39:13,638 --> 00:39:15,709
<i>Then, I'll go with Jo Minwoo.</i>

528
00:39:15,794 --> 00:39:19,075
Whoever loses will treat everyone else.

529
00:39:19,179 --> 00:39:21,099
Fine with me.

530
00:39:21,532 --> 00:39:23,935
- Right, Gangmo.
- Yes.

531
00:39:24,042 --> 00:39:27,188
I enrolled you into a labor scholarship, 
is it all right with you?

532
00:39:27,311 --> 00:39:28,446
Labor scholarship?

533
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:32,440
Ohh... You can just stay after school
and do some cleaning, that's all.

534
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:33,701
It's not big money,

535
00:39:33,814 --> 00:39:36,651
but it'll at least cover school expenses
and a little extra for you.

536
00:39:36,793 --> 00:39:38,003
Thank you, Seonsaengnim.

537
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:40,320
- I will do my best.
- All right.

538
00:40:09,665 --> 00:40:11,853
You must be hungry, so have it.

539
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:15,809
No, thanks.

540
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,296
Jeongshik.

541
00:40:18,485 --> 00:40:19,686
Ohh, what is it?

542
00:40:19,799 --> 00:40:21,643
<i>You said he lives with you?</i>

543
00:40:22,598 --> 00:40:25,990
Why don't you tell your mother
to prepare him a lunchbox?

544
00:40:26,141 --> 00:40:28,674
Why? He always eats so much 
during breakfast.

545
00:40:28,768 --> 00:40:31,446
It's got to be enough
to cover lunch as well.

546
00:40:31,541 --> 00:40:32,716
Right?

547
00:40:32,809 --> 00:40:35,463
<i>You ruminate like cows, don't you?</i>

548
00:40:39,237 --> 00:40:42,689
I hear you're still complaining
about cleaning the toilets?

549
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:46,420
All those who are fed and given the same 
education as us but keep failing...

550
00:40:46,514 --> 00:40:48,396
are all trash.

551
00:40:48,632 --> 00:40:52,500
<i>The reason our country's so poor
is because it's filled with such trash.</i>

552
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:56,349
I believe the rules I've set are right.

553
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:58,266
Because awarding the best students...

554
00:40:58,370 --> 00:41:00,262
and punishing those with
poor grades is only natural.

555
00:41:00,356 --> 00:41:03,672
You might be class president,
but still have no right to make such rules.

556
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:05,444
It's not as class president 
that I made them,

557
00:41:05,557 --> 00:41:09,326
but as the very top of the class,
helping raise everyone's average.

558
00:41:09,478 --> 00:41:13,657
Then, if I become top of the class,
then maybe I can change the rules?

559
00:41:13,809 --> 00:41:16,683
Why? Is that what you're aiming for?

560
00:41:16,797 --> 00:41:19,137
- Yeah.
- Go ahead.

561
00:41:19,478 --> 00:41:24,641
Nobody will ever surpass me.

562
00:42:38,838 --> 00:42:41,627
You passed the aptitude test, 
for starters.

563
00:42:43,159 --> 00:42:44,681
Starting now,

564
00:42:45,636 --> 00:42:49,428
your skills as a potential
recruit will be tested.

565
00:42:49,655 --> 00:42:53,828
There's a man named Eom,
selling ironware in Dongdaemun.

566
00:42:55,502 --> 00:42:57,630
Bring this to him.

567
00:43:02,065 --> 00:43:04,521
<i>You can't look at what's 
inside the envelope.</i>

568
00:43:04,644 --> 00:43:07,614
All you need to do is bringing him that.

569
00:43:10,242 --> 00:43:11,576
Yes, Sir.

570
00:43:11,784 --> 00:43:18,196
That Eom fella,
he's a resident spy from up north.

571
00:43:25,964 --> 00:43:30,286
The man you see was 
supposed to deliver this envelope.

572
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:35,189
<i>You'll take his place, just for today.</i>

573
00:43:36,121 --> 00:43:37,917
If you manage to complete your task,

574
00:43:38,028 --> 00:43:43,877
you will not only capture a northern spy 
plotting against our government,

575
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:50,058
you'll be accepted into
the KCIA as an elite recruit.

576
00:44:20,501 --> 00:44:24,256
<i>One is to never contest an order, 
no matter what it is.</i>

577
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:26,355
<i>You must follow his
instructions at all cost.</i>

578
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:29,582
<i>Obedience above everything else.</i>

579
00:44:52,702 --> 00:44:54,763
What are you looking for?

580
00:44:55,752 --> 00:44:57,710
I came to meet a Mister Eom.

581
00:44:57,866 --> 00:44:59,912
That'd be me.

582
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:02,881
What brings you here?

583
00:45:03,045 --> 00:45:05,538
I came to bring you this.

584
00:45:19,122 --> 00:45:22,091
<i>~ Get rid of him ~</i>

585
00:45:27,878 --> 00:45:30,621
Good job.
You may leave.

586
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:17,946
Come on in, Minwoo.
This is my house.

587
00:46:20,377 --> 00:46:21,663
See? I was right.

588
00:46:21,767 --> 00:46:24,208
<i>Told you he's our servant.</i>

589
00:46:24,322 --> 00:46:29,277
As busy as you are, 
think you'll find the time to beat me?

590
00:46:31,257 --> 00:46:34,377
By the way, with all the noise 
that piano's making,

591
00:46:34,453 --> 00:46:36,997
can one even study?

592
00:47:32,116 --> 00:47:33,993
Told you to stop playing.

593
00:47:34,144 --> 00:47:35,059
Who?

594
00:47:35,213 --> 00:47:36,778
Your mother.

595
00:47:38,106 --> 00:47:41,009
I'm playing at home,
what's wrong with her?

596
00:47:41,132 --> 00:47:43,939
Don't know. 
Just said Jeongshik needs to study.

597
00:47:44,044 --> 00:47:48,138
He must have a death wish...
How dare he tries to order me around?

598
00:47:56,843 --> 00:47:59,332
Hey, and when have you ever stu...

599
00:48:00,701 --> 00:48:03,330
Don't you people knock around here?

600
00:48:05,453 --> 00:48:07,836
Stop interfering with our studies and leave.

601
00:48:08,507 --> 00:48:10,539
Or sit here and learn.

602
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:12,063
What?

603
00:48:12,489 --> 00:48:16,743
After some of my special tutoring,
your grades will go up right away.

604
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:19,576
Worry about teaching that meathead.

605
00:48:27,103 --> 00:48:28,872
Where were we?

606
00:48:34,935 --> 00:48:39,190
<i>Awww... Why is our Minwoo so handsome?!</i>

607
00:48:39,284 --> 00:48:41,932
<i>Look who's talking...</i>

608
00:48:42,107 --> 00:48:45,052
Listen to you...

609
00:48:51,811 --> 00:48:53,808
Jeongyeon, are you going out?

610
00:48:53,921 --> 00:48:56,993
<i>Why did you wear that?</i>

611
00:49:01,793 --> 00:49:04,970
Minwoo.
Have some more ribs.

612
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:06,944
It's all right,
I've had a lot already.

613
00:49:07,024 --> 00:49:10,861
Minwoo, teach some of your secrets 
to Jeongshik, will you?

614
00:49:10,993 --> 00:49:14,057
I'll cook you all your favorite dishes.

615
00:49:14,218 --> 00:49:17,738
Other than studying hard,
I really have no secrets.

616
00:49:20,124 --> 00:49:21,680
I bought the fruits you asked.

617
00:49:21,831 --> 00:49:24,347
You did? Put them over there.

618
00:49:25,283 --> 00:49:29,113
Gangmo, go wash your hands and join us.

619
00:49:29,434 --> 00:49:31,501
You can eat later,

620
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:35,382
<i>but how many times do I have to tell you 
to throw out those briquettes?</i>

621
00:49:35,475 --> 00:49:36,948
<i>Take a look outside the gates!</i>

622
00:49:37,071 --> 00:49:39,161
<i>It's filled with trash.</i>

623
00:49:39,797 --> 00:49:42,927
All right, I'll go do it now.

624
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:47,380
Minwoo, come on... have some more.

625
00:49:48,043 --> 00:49:49,764
<i>Jeongshik, you too.</i>

626
00:50:54,466 --> 00:50:55,318
Hey.

627
00:50:55,429 --> 00:50:56,914
What are you doing?

628
00:50:57,218 --> 00:50:59,735
Leave.
I need to study.

629
00:51:02,231 --> 00:51:06,938
Go ahead and try to beat
Jo Minwoo at the next midterms.

630
00:51:07,042 --> 00:51:08,092
Why?

631
00:51:09,246 --> 00:51:11,648
Are you interested in him?

632
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:16,412
Am I what?! Hey... I haven't 
the slightest interest in him!

633
00:51:21,112 --> 00:51:22,559
It's just...

634
00:51:22,937 --> 00:51:27,774
You promised me 
you'd end on top, last time.

635
00:51:28,297 --> 00:51:31,462
If you win, 
I'll take you to the movies.

636
00:51:31,937 --> 00:51:35,150
Think I'm only studying so that
I can go to the movies with you?

637
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:37,694
If you think you can't win, 
just be honest,

638
00:51:37,791 --> 00:51:39,682
why are you getting angry?

639
00:51:51,862 --> 00:51:54,308
Let's wake up, Gangmo.

640
00:51:54,822 --> 00:51:56,701
Wake up.

641
00:52:05,932 --> 00:52:07,561
<i>Daeryuk Construction?!</i>

642
00:52:07,725 --> 00:52:11,892
Are you suggesting that government
building will be constructed...

643
00:52:11,983 --> 00:52:14,390
on Director Hong's land?

644
00:52:14,495 --> 00:52:17,988
He gained the upper hand, I guess.

645
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:19,840
Commissioner.

646
00:52:19,972 --> 00:52:24,341
Their progress is much slower than ours.

647
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:26,912
Who on earth made that decision, anyway?

648
00:52:27,005 --> 00:52:31,380
Don't you know how many people are 
trying to run the ship in this business?

649
00:52:31,468 --> 00:52:32,471
Commissioner.

650
00:52:32,613 --> 00:52:37,559
Whatever the case, we must make sure
that building is erected in Banpo.

651
00:52:37,758 --> 00:52:42,001
Don't you know better than anyone
how desperate our situation is?

652
00:52:42,190 --> 00:52:45,027
All that is in my power
to do at the moment...

653
00:52:45,169 --> 00:52:46,445
is being done.

654
00:52:46,587 --> 00:52:52,553
However, Director Hong
has really strong backing.

655
00:52:54,207 --> 00:52:56,713
If you need any lobbying funds,

656
00:52:56,914 --> 00:52:59,947
I will satisfy your requests,
whatever it takes.

657
00:53:00,113 --> 00:53:05,525
Just tell me what I
need to help you with.

658
00:53:06,215 --> 00:53:10,159
I believe it's a bit late
for that kind of strategy.

659
00:53:10,366 --> 00:53:14,840
Then, are you telling me to just give up?

660
00:53:15,219 --> 00:53:17,071
Nothing is set in stone yet,

661
00:53:17,233 --> 00:53:20,864
so I'll continue looking into it.

662
00:53:23,997 --> 00:53:30,276
So one man sows and another man reaps?

663
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:35,134
Director Hong...
He's getting in my way again?

664
00:53:35,645 --> 00:53:37,914
I ought to just...

665
00:53:39,238 --> 00:53:41,869
I just gathered you here so
that you could speak your mind.

666
00:53:41,984 --> 00:53:44,475
So let's enjoy the evening.

667
00:53:45,395 --> 00:53:50,669
I wonder if we really deserve any free drinks
from someone in the construction business?

668
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:53,023
<i>What are you saying, Director Min?</i>

669
00:53:53,137 --> 00:53:57,447
Who is making life easier for
businessmen like me, after all?

670
00:53:58,112 --> 00:54:00,628
Ohh... Right, let me introduce him.

671
00:54:00,761 --> 00:54:04,849
Here's our Inspection Department's
new acquisition, Chief Jo Pilyeon.

672
00:54:04,982 --> 00:54:07,611
I didn't introduce myself.

673
00:54:08,972 --> 00:54:11,715
I'm Director Hong Gipyo 
of Daeryuk Construction.

674
00:54:12,824 --> 00:54:16,277
Hope I can count on your patronage.

675
00:54:17,714 --> 00:54:21,629
I was in Jeonju for business,
so I bought a few bottles of quality liquor.

676
00:54:21,733 --> 00:54:24,220
What is it called, Igangju or something?

677
00:54:24,334 --> 00:54:25,417
Secretary Kim.

678
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:27,706
<i>You put this liquor in these
gentlemen's trunk, I hope?</i>

679
00:54:27,857 --> 00:54:29,436
<i>Yes, Director.</i>

680
00:54:29,824 --> 00:54:32,650
I guess the introductions 
went on too long.

681
00:54:38,943 --> 00:54:40,751
Come on in.

682
00:54:43,853 --> 00:54:47,190
You must reserve special
treatment for them tonight.

683
00:54:47,267 --> 00:54:48,715
Yes.

684
00:54:49,178 --> 00:54:50,824
Let's have a drink.

685
00:54:54,010 --> 00:54:57,206
- Here, have some.
- Yes, yes.

686
00:55:00,933 --> 00:55:02,719
Go ahead.

687
00:55:10,014 --> 00:55:11,794
I'm sorry.

688
00:55:11,995 --> 00:55:15,841
If I knew this would happen,
I would have aimed higher from the start.

689
00:55:30,581 --> 00:55:33,105
What are you doing here?

690
00:55:33,384 --> 00:55:35,772
What could I have come
to a place like this for?

691
00:55:36,718 --> 00:55:39,421
I hear you're quite busy as of late?!

692
00:55:39,535 --> 00:55:40,821
Enough that you can't be reached.

693
00:55:40,934 --> 00:55:42,305
My apologies.

694
00:55:42,457 --> 00:55:45,379
I will contact you soon.

695
00:55:45,570 --> 00:55:48,490
If you'll excuse me...

696
00:55:49,379 --> 00:55:50,545
<i>Chief.</i>

697
00:55:50,718 --> 00:55:52,569
<i>You were here.</i>

698
00:55:56,575 --> 00:55:58,744
Isn't this Director Hwang?

699
00:56:02,231 --> 00:56:03,479
Hey!

700
00:56:03,727 --> 00:56:06,117
What else are you scheming here?

701
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:08,614
What are you doing, 
embarrassing yourself?

702
00:56:08,831 --> 00:56:13,042
Want to advertise to the whole world
you were an ignorant construction worker?

703
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:15,307
You son of a bitch!

704
00:56:15,884 --> 00:56:19,090
Sure! I used to work
at a construction site.

705
00:56:19,270 --> 00:56:23,198
But at least I'm not a wolf
in sheep's clothing like you!

706
00:56:23,311 --> 00:56:25,999
That is how it might look
to an ignorant fool like you,

707
00:56:26,302 --> 00:56:27,427
but this is how you do business.

708
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:29,952
You bastard...

709
00:56:30,366 --> 00:56:32,332
<i>What is going on?</i>

710
00:56:36,644 --> 00:56:37,784
Who are you?

711
00:56:37,875 --> 00:56:38,938
Some gangster?

712
00:56:39,030 --> 00:56:42,558
Don't get yourself 
in trouble for barging in,

713
00:56:42,662 --> 00:56:43,728
and get the hell out of my face.

714
00:56:43,804 --> 00:56:45,593
You little...

715
00:56:45,895 --> 00:56:47,343
Are you out of your mind?

716
00:56:47,418 --> 00:56:49,517
<i>- Stop it, Director Hwang.
- Let me go!</i>

717
00:56:49,609 --> 00:56:51,316
Who the hell are you?

718
00:56:51,405 --> 00:56:53,990
Why don't you come get some?

719
00:56:54,477 --> 00:56:56,131
I apologize, Director.

720
00:56:57,346 --> 00:57:01,166
Director?

721
00:57:01,994 --> 00:57:03,450
Chief Jo.

722
00:57:03,647 --> 00:57:05,502
Do you know this man?

723
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:13,958
No. Not really.

724
00:57:16,182 --> 00:57:17,350
<i>Let's go back in, Director.</i>

725
00:57:17,482 --> 00:57:19,932
No need to let this break the mood.

726
00:57:20,315 --> 00:57:21,464
You!

727
00:57:21,966 --> 00:57:25,085
I'll remember that face of yours, 
so be careful.

728
00:57:25,821 --> 00:57:27,438
Let's go.

729
00:57:29,503 --> 00:57:32,908
What... Director?!

730
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:42,624
Just a moment.

731
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:50,905
Who is Hong Gipyo drinking with inside?

732
00:57:53,241 --> 00:57:55,675
No... Forget that,

733
00:57:55,830 --> 00:57:59,807
- let's just have a drink, and...
- Look, Hwang Taeseop.

734
00:57:59,984 --> 00:58:03,949
I'm just as busy with work
as you are with yours.

735
00:58:04,110 --> 00:58:08,256
I'm not the kind of man who
could meet you all the time anymore.

736
00:58:08,379 --> 00:58:09,826
Is that clear?

737
00:58:09,968 --> 00:58:11,414
What I was saying...

738
00:58:11,493 --> 00:58:15,689
I have a lot of thoughts
in my head, these days.

739
00:58:16,001 --> 00:58:20,232
For instance, how I should
repay a certain Hwang Taeseop...

740
00:58:20,337 --> 00:58:22,630
for betraying my trust.

741
00:58:24,089 --> 00:58:31,039
The KCIA's Inspection Department tends to 
wield its knife before it starts talking.

742
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:37,148
You'll have to start waking up
and hope I won't have to visit you.

743
00:58:45,192 --> 00:58:50,151
The KCIA's Ins...Inspection Department?

744
00:58:50,344 --> 00:58:52,789
He's a chief there.

745
00:58:53,936 --> 00:58:57,342
Then, that man earlier on...

746
00:58:57,777 --> 00:59:00,633
He surely must be some higher-up 
in the KCIA hierarchy.

747
00:59:03,281 --> 00:59:08,621
I sure ended up getting my hands dirty...

748
00:59:20,582 --> 00:59:22,550
It's the liquor 
Director Hong Gipyo brought you.

749
00:59:22,701 --> 00:59:24,243
Open it.

750
00:59:30,271 --> 00:59:35,604
Seems like Director Hong's ties with KCIA
higher-ups are deeper than we thought.

751
00:59:36,321 --> 00:59:38,734
Just save it as it is.

752
00:59:38,857 --> 00:59:40,581
All right.

753
00:59:40,957 --> 00:59:42,120
Right...

754
00:59:42,407 --> 00:59:45,306
Is Lee Seongmo still unaccounted for?

755
00:59:46,167 --> 00:59:47,529
Yes.

756
00:59:48,758 --> 00:59:50,989
He was going to test him...

757
00:59:51,689 --> 00:59:54,346
But something doesn't feel right.

758
01:00:35,342 --> 01:00:36,717
Still not done?

759
01:00:36,839 --> 01:00:39,210
Ahh... Just the principal's office is left.

760
01:00:39,323 --> 01:00:41,972
You have a test tomorrow,
so just rush it and go home.

761
01:00:42,086 --> 01:00:43,674
Yes, Seonsaengnim.

762
01:00:49,331 --> 01:00:50,428
Minwoo's mother?

763
01:00:50,589 --> 01:00:52,584
Seonsaengnim...

764
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:55,618
Yoon Seonsaeng, still haven't left?

765
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:57,585
I was just about to.

766
01:00:57,736 --> 01:01:00,526
But, what brings you here so late?

767
01:01:00,668 --> 01:01:02,457
Yes...

768
01:01:02,583 --> 01:01:05,708
I had something to discuss with the
principal regarding the board of education.

769
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:07,933
Ahh... I see.

770
01:01:08,117 --> 01:01:10,298
I'll treat you to dinner, next time.

771
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:13,088
- Yes.
- Here... Let's go.

772
01:01:25,427 --> 01:01:26,933
By the way,

773
01:01:27,314 --> 01:01:31,192
I hear that this boy called Lee Gangmo 
is scoring first in drill tests?

774
01:01:31,344 --> 01:01:33,594
<i>He seems to be working hard,</i>

775
01:01:33,736 --> 01:01:36,274
<i>but both for the sake of
our school or anything else,</i>

776
01:01:36,349 --> 01:01:40,446
there is no doubt that
Minwoo needs to be on top.

777
01:01:40,654 --> 01:01:42,954
<i>So...</i>

778
01:01:46,179 --> 01:01:49,758
<i>Here's the list of questions
for the upcoming midterms.</i>

779
01:01:49,995 --> 01:01:51,583
<i>Yes.</i>

780
01:01:52,918 --> 01:01:56,680
<i>I hear that the Ministry of Education
will award meritorious schools...</i>

781
01:01:56,787 --> 01:01:59,501
<i>with a development fund.</i>

782
01:01:59,626 --> 01:02:00,644
<i>Yes.</i>

783
01:02:00,735 --> 01:02:03,027
I've heard it at the last PTA meeting.

784
01:02:03,812 --> 01:02:07,138
I'd really love to receive that fund,

785
01:02:07,525 --> 01:02:11,975
<i>and since Minwoo's father is
chairman of the board of education...</i>

786
01:02:12,170 --> 01:02:14,541
I'll talk to him.

787
01:02:14,674 --> 01:02:17,410
<i>I appreciate it.</i>

788
01:02:29,966 --> 01:02:32,378
<i>You're back?</i>

789
01:02:33,815 --> 01:02:35,129
Here.

790
01:02:37,381 --> 01:02:39,137
I told you not to do this again.

791
01:02:39,268 --> 01:02:41,264
Solve them all tonight.

792
01:02:41,517 --> 01:02:44,479
I can be top of the class 
even without this.

793
01:02:44,593 --> 01:02:46,507
But if you end up losing that spot?

794
01:02:46,615 --> 01:02:48,232
Don't you know your father?

795
01:02:48,365 --> 01:02:49,235
Mom!

796
01:02:49,348 --> 01:02:51,263
Think I'm enjoying this?

797
01:02:51,358 --> 01:02:55,197
Your father only accepts excellence.

798
01:02:55,287 --> 01:02:57,764
Do you think you could cope
with that, should you fail?

799
01:03:00,529 --> 01:03:03,447
Don't get yourself into trouble
just for a matter of excessive pride,

800
01:03:03,598 --> 01:03:06,208
and just solve these
before you take the test.

801
01:03:43,868 --> 01:03:45,466
Fine, Jo Minwoo.

802
01:03:45,598 --> 01:03:47,310
You asked for it.

803
01:03:47,486 --> 01:03:50,128
I'm never going to allow you to beat me.

804
01:04:04,142 --> 01:04:06,778
And Gangmo?

805
01:04:07,936 --> 01:04:09,386
I'll go wake him up.

806
01:04:09,482 --> 01:04:12,261
Just sit.
You'll spoil him.

807
01:04:12,488 --> 01:04:15,202
He's already annoying me enough
by keeping the lights on all night,

808
01:04:15,297 --> 01:04:18,337
do we even have to 
wake him up for breakfast?

809
01:04:20,750 --> 01:04:21,951
I said forget him!

810
01:04:22,055 --> 01:04:24,201
I'm done eating?!

811
01:04:27,456 --> 01:04:29,689
Little brat...

812
01:04:30,059 --> 01:04:31,759
<i>Jeongshik, you...</i>

813
01:04:32,102 --> 01:04:34,029
Have you studied?

814
01:04:34,441 --> 01:04:35,617
What?

815
01:04:36,830 --> 01:04:38,257
Yes...

816
01:04:38,965 --> 01:04:43,174
Gangmo seems to have really worked hard,

817
01:04:43,344 --> 01:04:46,612
you're not going to lose to him, are you?

818
01:04:46,725 --> 01:04:49,924
<i>Aigoo... At least Jeongshik
can land in the middle.</i>

819
01:04:50,028 --> 01:04:53,281
How can you compare him
with someone who's dead last?

820
01:04:53,432 --> 01:04:54,652
Eat.

821
01:04:55,503 --> 01:04:57,405
I'll go to school.

822
01:04:57,498 --> 01:04:58,841
You...

823
01:04:59,189 --> 01:05:01,043
If you don't want to work
at the construction site,

824
01:05:01,175 --> 01:05:03,899
you better do well.

825
01:05:13,913 --> 01:05:16,646
Hey! Aren't you coming to school?

826
01:05:17,894 --> 01:05:19,634
Miss the test and I'll show you...

827
01:05:19,728 --> 01:05:21,516
Consider yourself dead if you do.

828
01:05:21,820 --> 01:05:24,152
What... What time is it?

829
01:05:39,844 --> 01:05:42,272
I didn't study at all...

830
01:06:14,570 --> 01:06:16,140
Lee Gangmo?

831
01:06:17,502 --> 01:06:19,686
Is Lee Gangmo still not here?

832
01:06:27,894 --> 01:06:29,430
What's this?

833
01:06:29,727 --> 01:06:31,268
<i>What is it?</i>

834
01:06:36,676 --> 01:06:38,652
Open the door!

835
01:06:38,837 --> 01:06:40,269
Jeongyeon!

836
01:06:40,398 --> 01:06:41,848
Jeongshik!

837
01:06:41,988 --> 01:06:43,759
Ajumma!

838
01:06:43,995 --> 01:06:46,209
Open the door!

839
01:06:46,515 --> 01:06:48,161
Ajumma!

840
01:06:49,343 --> 01:06:50,809
Jeongyeon!

01:07:03,621 --> 01:07:06,049
<i>What kind of test 
did you put him through?</i>

847
01:07:06,137 --> 01:07:07,904
What kind of test could it possibly be?

848
01:07:07,993 --> 01:07:10,166
<i>What are you, complaining?</i>

849
01:07:10,854 --> 01:07:13,941
Wow! You're really great!

850
01:07:14,124 --> 01:07:16,574
<i>- Then, how about Minwoo?
- He's just a prick.</i>

851
01:07:16,689 --> 01:07:19,304
<i>Are you jealous?</i>

852
01:07:20,057 --> 01:07:24,095
I'm well aware of what you've done.

853
01:07:24,299 --> 01:07:27,090
He said he would contribute to
the national development fund.

854
01:07:27,213 --> 01:07:28,736
<i>And who's that?</i>

855
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:31,318
<i>Do you know why I like you?</i>

856
01:07:31,450 --> 01:07:33,625
<i>Because you don't lie to me.</i>

857
01:07:33,748 --> 01:07:36,141
<i>Whatever anyone says, I trust you.</i>

858
01:07:36,231 --> 01:07:37,521
<i>Jeongyeon!</i>

859
01:07:37,635 --> 01:07:38,819
<i>Agasshi (lady).</i>

860
01:07:40,224 --> 01:07:42,488
<i>I told you not to
call me that, didn't I?</i>
