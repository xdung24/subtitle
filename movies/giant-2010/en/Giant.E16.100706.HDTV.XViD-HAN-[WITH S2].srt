5
00:00:11,168 --> 00:00:14,523
What?! Did you follow me here?

6
00:00:16,537 --> 00:00:18,158
Miju...

7
00:00:21,414 --> 00:00:23,343
Oppa?

8
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:38,232
Ga...

9
00:00:38,976 --> 00:00:41,183
Gangmo Oppa?

10
00:00:45,514 --> 00:00:47,391
Oppa!

11
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:49,586
Miju.

12
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:53,792
Gangmo Oppa...

13
00:00:56,477 --> 00:00:58,367
Miju...

14
00:01:45,062 --> 00:01:47,648
Junmo?!

15
00:01:48,232 --> 00:01:49,973
Yeah.

16
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:53,598
I called him Junmo.

17
00:01:54,459 --> 00:01:56,459
I see.

18
00:01:56,739 --> 00:02:01,228
So our youngest has
gone far away, to the US.

19
00:02:06,482 --> 00:02:08,116
Still, that's a relief.

20
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,396
I saw you come alone,

21
00:02:10,524 --> 00:02:14,322
so I was worried he might
have ended up like Mom.

22
00:02:16,109 --> 00:02:19,518
I ran away from 
the orphanage in Daejeon.

23
00:02:19,871 --> 00:02:23,773
I worked hard to
come to Seoul right away,

24
00:02:23,932 --> 00:02:26,797
but finding enough money was not easy.

25
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,791
I'm sorry, Miju.

26
00:02:29,955 --> 00:02:31,445
Don't say that.

27
00:02:31,544 --> 00:02:33,948
I'm to be blamed for that, anyway.

28
00:02:34,206 --> 00:02:38,300
You told me to wait at that bakery.

29
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,653
Miju.

30
00:02:42,915 --> 00:02:44,968
Look at me.

31
00:02:46,285 --> 00:02:51,625
From here on in, 
I'll make you live in luxury.

32
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:56,282
We'll find our Junmo,

33
00:02:59,157 --> 00:03:04,741
and I'll make up for everything
you've been going through all this time.

34
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:10,764
I'll never separate from you again.

35
00:03:10,947 --> 00:03:14,295
I'll stick right beside you.

36
00:03:34,053 --> 00:03:36,235
I'm really foolish.

37
00:03:36,527 --> 00:03:39,478
You haven't changed a bit.

38
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:43,331
You look just like
the last time I met you.

39
00:03:45,721 --> 00:03:47,638
Same goes for me.

40
00:03:47,734 --> 00:03:50,354
I couldn't even recognize you.

41
00:03:54,183 --> 00:03:58,157
Any news of Big Oppa?

42
00:04:00,322 --> 00:04:05,085
Still, it's nice not having
to wait for him alone.

43
00:04:07,926 --> 00:04:09,669
Miju.

44
00:04:10,718 --> 00:04:12,156
I...

45
00:04:12,473 --> 00:04:14,656
don't think we'll find him.

46
00:04:16,424 --> 00:04:22,168
- He might even...
- Be dead?

47
00:04:25,484 --> 00:04:28,361
I'm not saying I never
considered the possibility,

48
00:04:28,593 --> 00:04:35,013
since there is no way he wouldn't
have known where to find us.

49
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,885
Still, I don't believe he's dead.

50
00:04:38,975 --> 00:04:41,007
Why, you do?

51
00:04:41,134 --> 00:04:42,252
Nah.

52
00:04:42,344 --> 00:04:43,945
See?

53
00:04:44,043 --> 00:04:47,814
We must wait for him even in old age, 
if that's what it takes.

54
00:04:48,261 --> 00:04:49,838
Right.

55
00:04:50,692 --> 00:04:52,752
Let's wait.

56
00:04:54,081 --> 00:04:59,677
Until he shows up before us, 
let's not give up.

57
00:05:20,562 --> 00:05:24,464
KCIA agents have already been here.

58
00:06:07,225 --> 00:06:09,757
Isn't that girl clever?

59
00:06:09,878 --> 00:06:13,073
She even thought of hiding it 
in a place like this.

60
00:06:17,694 --> 00:06:19,318
By the way, Oppa.

61
00:06:19,498 --> 00:06:23,435
If we do as you say, 
can the chairman really be safe?

62
00:06:23,528 --> 00:06:25,097
I told you.

63
00:06:25,263 --> 00:06:30,291
If that account is revealed, Chairman
Hong will only end up in more trouble.

64
00:06:30,532 --> 00:06:34,290
And if he asks me for it, 
what do I tell him?

65
00:06:34,912 --> 00:06:37,899
Just tell him the truth
and try to convince him.

66
00:06:38,545 --> 00:06:40,688
I'll take care of everything.

67
00:06:41,337 --> 00:06:44,575
All right, I'll count on you.

68
00:06:45,897 --> 00:06:47,568
Let's go.

69
00:07:15,343 --> 00:07:17,462
What happened here?

70
00:07:17,877 --> 00:07:19,618
Who took this...

71
00:07:19,704 --> 00:07:21,271
You hid it there?

72
00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:22,826
Yeah...

73
00:07:28,972 --> 00:07:32,075
Who else knows you put it here?

74
00:07:32,228 --> 00:07:33,313
The chairman.

75
00:07:33,435 --> 00:07:35,070
Chairman Hong?

76
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:41,458
This is my house! My house!
No trespassing!

77
00:07:41,574 --> 00:07:44,681
Nobody can enter my house!
Where do you think you're going?

78
00:07:44,915 --> 00:07:48,780
You bitches!
What were you trying to steal?

79
00:07:48,865 --> 00:07:51,779
Don't even think about it!
It's no use!

80
00:07:56,827 --> 00:07:58,829
This won't do it! Fall back!

81
00:07:59,037 --> 00:08:00,533
Quick!

82
00:08:07,644 --> 00:08:09,254
Seonbaenim.

83
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:10,704
What brings you here?

84
00:08:10,799 --> 00:08:12,885
We were out working nearby.

85
00:08:13,153 --> 00:08:14,726
Tough assignment, isn't it?

86
00:08:15,349 --> 00:08:17,018
It's killing me.

87
00:08:17,152 --> 00:08:19,566
I've had it with staring at him 
prancing around like a fool.

88
00:08:19,688 --> 00:08:21,578
It's even driving me crazy, now.

89
00:08:21,724 --> 00:08:22,992
Had lunch?

90
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:27,053
Can't you see I'm even losing weight?

91
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:28,808
You go have lunch.

92
00:08:28,943 --> 00:08:30,357
- I'll cover for you.
- Really?

93
00:08:30,442 --> 00:08:31,857
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

94
00:08:32,064 --> 00:08:33,588
Let's go, I'll buy you something nice.

95
00:08:33,685 --> 00:08:35,758
Eat all you want.

96
00:08:42,094 --> 00:08:43,808
What brings you...

97
00:08:44,289 --> 00:08:48,044
You keep this.

98
00:08:51,349 --> 00:08:54,495
Jo Pilyeon has started
suspecting your housemaid.

99
00:08:54,836 --> 00:08:56,604
It will be much safer here.

100
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:58,994
When will the surveillance be eased?

101
00:08:59,847 --> 00:09:02,847
Jo will soon enter the by-elections.

102
00:09:03,005 --> 00:09:04,563
That will be our chance.

103
00:09:04,712 --> 00:09:06,045
All right.

104
00:09:06,222 --> 00:09:08,283
We'll wait until then.

105
00:09:08,716 --> 00:09:10,355
Right...

106
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:14,562
I don't know if I 
should ask you this favor...

107
00:09:14,691 --> 00:09:16,025
Please, go ahead.

108
00:09:16,173 --> 00:09:21,902
My housemaid asked me 
to find her family.

109
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:24,364
I might not be able 
to do anything else for her,

110
00:09:24,547 --> 00:09:26,730
but I wanted to 
at least do that for her.

111
00:09:26,876 --> 00:09:29,266
So she's looking for someone?

112
00:09:29,497 --> 00:09:34,346
Here's the names and dates of birth 
of the people she's looking for.

113
00:09:35,565 --> 00:09:37,864
Sorry for troubling you with this.

114
00:09:37,979 --> 00:09:39,345
Don't mention it.

115
00:09:39,491 --> 00:09:42,266
I'll have the boys look for them 
whenever they have time.

116
00:09:42,412 --> 00:09:44,144
Yes.

117
00:10:15,212 --> 00:10:17,245
<i>To Manbo Construction
and our planning team!</i>

118
00:10:17,395 --> 00:10:19,211
Cheers!

119
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:28,724
How did you manage to hide
so well the fact you were dating?

120
00:10:28,817 --> 00:10:30,146
I apologize.

121
00:10:30,222 --> 00:10:33,078
If you felt betrayed in any way, 
try to be understanding.

122
00:10:33,164 --> 00:10:34,854
I was just curious,

123
00:10:34,949 --> 00:10:38,294
who was the first to propose?

124
00:10:39,343 --> 00:10:40,306
I did.

125
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,167
So what do you find so
charming about Jeongyeon?

126
00:10:44,618 --> 00:10:48,784
She's so beautiful when she smiles, 
I fell in love at first sight.

127
00:10:49,098 --> 00:10:53,365
And what do you like
about Chief Jo, Jeongyeon?

128
00:10:53,731 --> 00:10:55,121
What can I say...

129
00:10:55,242 --> 00:10:58,445
I was curious as well.
Go ahead and tell us.

130
00:11:00,741 --> 00:11:04,256
Just... He's a very capable
and good looking man.

131
00:11:04,317 --> 00:11:05,548
Ehh...

132
00:11:05,646 --> 00:11:07,548
That's so conventional.

133
00:11:07,645 --> 00:11:10,657
No, it actually doesn't sound too bad.

134
00:12:08,202 --> 00:12:09,217
Chief.

135
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:12,203
Why don't you have a dance together?

136
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:14,390
No, thanks.
I can't really dance.

137
00:12:14,524 --> 00:12:16,987
Ehh... You'll soon get married,

138
00:12:17,109 --> 00:12:18,487
let us have a look!

139
00:12:18,621 --> 00:12:21,887
What are you doing?
Men have to take the initiative!

140
00:12:21,998 --> 00:12:27,878
Dance for us! Dance for us!

141
00:12:29,234 --> 00:12:31,239
<i>Let's have a dance.</i>

142
00:12:34,543 --> 00:12:36,674
I told you I can't dance!

143
00:12:36,808 --> 00:12:43,369
Dance for us! Dance for us!

144
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:51,500
Blues! Blues!

145
00:13:12,649 --> 00:13:16,825
Did you tell them about our marriage?

146
00:13:17,118 --> 00:13:19,636
They would have found out anyway.

147
00:13:19,734 --> 00:13:20,995
Why does it bother you so much?

148
00:13:21,105 --> 00:13:25,750
Do you even realize the kind of stares 
I get from all the female colleagues?

149
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:27,871
It's as if I forced someone
to marry me against his will,

150
00:13:27,969 --> 00:13:31,346
just because I'm the chairman's daughter.

151
00:13:31,664 --> 00:13:34,955
It's not completely false, is it?

152
00:13:35,157 --> 00:13:36,479
What?

153
00:13:37,845 --> 00:13:42,319
Nothing seems to bother you, 
but when it's your colleagues, it does?

154
00:13:42,429 --> 00:13:45,599
Haven't you had enough 
of that sarcasm?

155
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,263
If you want them 
to stop misunderstanding,

156
00:13:52,553 --> 00:13:55,897
we'll have to at least
pretend we love each other.

157
00:13:56,214 --> 00:13:58,823
How about you lean on my shoulders?

158
00:13:59,115 --> 00:14:01,375
Think that would be just right?!

159
00:14:11,409 --> 00:14:13,377
Wipe that look off your face.

160
00:14:14,024 --> 00:14:17,035
You're dancing with the man you love.

161
00:14:17,996 --> 00:14:20,184
You should smile.

162
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,260
Oh my... I'm so sorry!

163
00:14:28,418 --> 00:14:31,344
Never really danced like this before.

164
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:40,716
Should smile, right?

165
00:14:41,012 --> 00:14:45,374
Can you look like that while
dancing with the woman you love?

166
00:15:15,268 --> 00:15:17,012
Drive slowly, please.

167
00:15:17,158 --> 00:15:18,752
<i>Yes.</i>

168
00:15:19,212 --> 00:15:23,007
It's okay if we're late, 
so you can drive around the block again.

169
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,434
<i>Yes, all right.</i>

170
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:01,172
Agasshi.

171
00:16:02,549 --> 00:16:04,208
<i>Don't touch her.</i>

172
00:16:15,827 --> 00:16:17,118
Jeongyeon.

173
00:16:17,301 --> 00:16:19,447
Get on my back.

174
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,384
Gangmo...

175
00:17:10,193 --> 00:17:12,753
Shall we go out and have a word?

176
00:17:19,483 --> 00:17:22,275
It's time you leave Jeongyeon alone.

177
00:17:23,031 --> 00:17:25,244
We'll soon get married.

178
00:17:25,671 --> 00:17:28,000
I can ask you that much, can't I?

179
00:17:28,243 --> 00:17:30,145
Done talking?

180
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:33,267
Good night.

181
00:17:34,231 --> 00:17:36,386
<i>Think I don't know?</i>

182
00:17:36,951 --> 00:17:40,161
I will no longer tolerate...

183
00:17:41,023 --> 00:17:43,327
you being in love with my future wife.

184
00:17:44,168 --> 00:17:48,082
Don't ever hang around Jeongyeon 
in my presence again.

185
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:54,057
Let's call it a last warning out of gratitude,
for protecting Jeongyeon all this time.

186
00:17:56,044 --> 00:17:58,105
Jo Minwoo.

187
00:18:01,689 --> 00:18:04,877
If you dare make my Agasshi unhappy,

188
00:18:06,434 --> 00:18:08,230
then,

189
00:18:10,351 --> 00:18:12,265
I will kill you with my own hands.

190
00:18:12,472 --> 00:18:14,509
"My Agasshi"?!

191
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:19,723
Without you around,
she'll only be happier.

192
00:18:34,067 --> 00:18:36,603
- What? You found your sister?!
- Yeah.

193
00:18:36,701 --> 00:18:41,651
- Congrats, man!
- Put me down.

194
00:18:43,151 --> 00:18:44,956
When all this is dealt with,

195
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,699
I'll ask the chairman if
he can get a house for us.

196
00:18:47,858 --> 00:18:50,370
You want to leave his house?

197
00:18:51,101 --> 00:18:52,613
I'll live with Miju from now on.

198
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:54,003
Then again,

199
00:18:55,100 --> 00:19:00,588
after Jeongyeon gets married,
why would you continue living there?

200
00:19:03,093 --> 00:19:04,978
<i>The account?</i>

201
00:19:05,265 --> 00:19:07,685
<i>Is your sister really keeping it?</i>

202
00:19:08,557 --> 00:19:11,699
<i>I think Chairman Hong has it, now.</i>

203
00:19:12,199 --> 00:19:14,890
Are you telling me he has the account?

204
00:19:14,998 --> 00:19:18,490
Yeah... We were one step too late.

205
00:19:18,868 --> 00:19:20,489
<i>Is that for real?</i>

206
00:19:20,892 --> 00:19:22,319
Young Master...

207
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:26,608
So Chairman Hong has that account?

208
00:19:27,244 --> 00:19:29,446
You, don't even think about it.

209
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:30,303
Young Master.

210
00:19:30,412 --> 00:19:33,501
I'll go get it myself,
so you forget about it.

211
00:19:33,593 --> 00:19:34,180
Got it?

212
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:35,593
I will.

213
00:19:35,699 --> 00:19:36,423
What?!

214
00:19:36,521 --> 00:19:39,279
Make a wrong move,
and you'll risk dearly.

215
00:19:39,413 --> 00:19:41,523
I will get it and later
give it to you, so...

216
00:19:41,584 --> 00:19:44,705
You little... Want trouble?

217
00:19:45,656 --> 00:19:48,053
What? I'll risk dearly?

218
00:19:48,192 --> 00:19:50,024
Do I look so foolish to you?

219
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:51,968
- Young Master.
- You!

220
00:19:52,431 --> 00:19:55,528
Hope I made myself clear
when I said get your hands off.

221
00:19:56,326 --> 00:19:58,917
You know what happens
if you disobey me, right?

222
00:20:03,075 --> 00:20:06,407
He's like damned pepper spray...

223
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:08,211
<i>What now?</i>

224
00:20:08,394 --> 00:20:13,298
<i>If he goes for it by himself,
he'll get into trouble.</i>

225
00:20:15,709 --> 00:20:18,301
Let me go!
What's wrong with you?

226
00:20:18,394 --> 00:20:20,377
Where are you taking me?

227
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:22,902
Let go... Let me go!

228
00:20:39,217 --> 00:20:41,015
Should we follow them?

229
00:20:42,399 --> 00:20:45,355
- Return to the office.
- Yes, all right.

230
00:21:01,628 --> 00:21:03,213
You remain here.

231
00:21:03,415 --> 00:21:05,029
Yes.

232
00:21:13,796 --> 00:21:15,624
Is there any place you can use to hide?

233
00:21:15,722 --> 00:21:16,722
Yes.

234
00:21:16,844 --> 00:21:20,079
There's a cottage I bought
under a friend's name.

235
00:21:20,331 --> 00:21:24,869
As troublesome as it might be,
hide there until I call you.

236
00:21:24,976 --> 00:21:27,084
Yes, I will.

237
00:21:27,683 --> 00:21:29,239
Let's go.

238
00:23:22,785 --> 00:23:25,365
- Miju.
- Oppa!

239
00:23:25,455 --> 00:23:26,359
What's this, did you just buy them?

240
00:23:26,432 --> 00:23:28,200
Yeah... I knew you'd come.

241
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:30,063
I'll cook you a nice dinner.

242
00:23:30,188 --> 00:23:33,038
- I already prepared it?!
- You did?

243
00:23:33,129 --> 00:23:36,526
Yeah. You must be hungry.
Here... Let's go.

244
00:23:40,245 --> 00:23:42,073
It's a TV set?!

245
00:23:42,244 --> 00:23:46,607
When you're alone and
feel bored, watch that.

246
00:23:47,731 --> 00:23:49,838
Must have been expensive...

247
00:23:50,383 --> 00:23:51,862
Here.

248
00:23:53,813 --> 00:23:54,879
What's all this?

249
00:23:54,996 --> 00:23:58,487
Bought you some clothes and shoes.

250
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:03,608
They're all your size, so try them out.

251
00:24:03,937 --> 00:24:06,439
Oppa, give me your wallet.

252
00:24:06,607 --> 00:24:07,253
My wallet?

253
00:24:07,351 --> 00:24:09,263
Do it.

254
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,774
Here.

255
00:24:16,395 --> 00:24:19,926
Sure... Take whatever you need.

256
00:24:21,138 --> 00:24:22,418
30,000 won are left.

257
00:24:22,515 --> 00:24:25,559
<i>That's your allowance for
the month. Spend it wisely.</i>

258
00:24:25,932 --> 00:24:27,741
Guess I'll be busy tomorrow.

259
00:24:27,895 --> 00:24:31,357
I have to go to the bank and
open an account in your name,

260
00:24:31,528 --> 00:24:34,979
<i>and return all these clothes and shoes.</i>

261
00:24:35,393 --> 00:24:36,198
Miju.

262
00:24:36,381 --> 00:24:37,856
Be careful with money.

263
00:24:37,929 --> 00:24:42,234
We must save, and find our brothers.

264
00:24:42,342 --> 00:24:45,850
My brother doesn't
seem to have matured yet.

265
00:24:50,337 --> 00:24:52,532
It's your birthday today.

266
00:24:56,218 --> 00:24:58,071
Today...

267
00:24:59,668 --> 00:25:02,314
is the day you were born, Miju.

268
00:25:12,275 --> 00:25:13,872
<i>Here.</i>

269
00:25:24,436 --> 00:25:30,434
So I had a birthday like the others...

270
00:25:36,664 --> 00:25:42,565
I completely forgot my birthday, 
all this time.

271
00:25:44,223 --> 00:25:54,226
<i>{\a6}*eaten during birthdays; symbolizes
health and gratitude towards one's mother</i>

272
00:25:44,223 --> 00:25:54,226
After Mom died, 
I never had seaweed soup*.

273
00:26:00,129 --> 00:26:01,921
Give me your hand.

274
00:26:02,752 --> 00:26:04,579
Go ahead and eat.

275
00:26:05,446 --> 00:26:07,140
<i>Quick.</i>

276
00:26:13,809 --> 00:26:16,784
Thanks, Oppa.

277
00:27:03,105 --> 00:27:04,592
<i>Miju.</i>

278
00:27:06,068 --> 00:27:08,438
Know what my dream is?

279
00:27:09,158 --> 00:27:10,548
What is it?

280
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:18,168
To erect the 
tallest building in Seoul,

281
00:27:19,033 --> 00:27:22,566
and on the very top,

282
00:27:22,883 --> 00:27:29,662
you and I, 
Hyung, and little Junmo...

283
00:27:30,442 --> 00:27:32,917
All living together.

284
00:27:34,364 --> 00:27:36,120
That's nice.

285
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,331
And what's yours?

286
00:27:38,485 --> 00:27:39,778
Me?

287
00:27:43,484 --> 00:27:49,439
Becoming our country's 
most famous singer.

288
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:52,780
You will make it.

289
00:27:55,245 --> 00:27:57,706
- Really?
- Sure.

290
00:27:59,876 --> 00:28:02,408
Hey, Seoul!

291
00:28:04,859 --> 00:28:07,261
Listen well!

292
00:28:08,221 --> 00:28:10,991
My little sister here, Miju!

293
00:28:11,577 --> 00:28:16,335
She's going to become
Korea's most famous singer!

294
00:28:21,724 --> 00:28:23,677
Seoul!

295
00:28:23,857 --> 00:28:26,198
Listen well!

296
00:28:26,564 --> 00:28:33,901
My brother is going to build
the tallest skyscraper in Seoul!

297
00:28:34,657 --> 00:28:37,278
We'll succeed for sure!

298
00:28:37,988 --> 00:28:42,927
We'll succeed and live together!

299
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:53,449
Dammit, what kind of rotten scoundrel
is making all this noise at this hour?

300
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,572
Where did he go?

301
00:29:00,999 --> 00:29:03,364
Those young twerps these days...

302
00:29:03,925 --> 00:29:08,461
They don't have 
any sense of community!

303
00:29:08,778 --> 00:29:12,092
Ehhh! You motherless little rascals!

304
00:29:51,367 --> 00:29:54,072
Oh my... I'm so sorry...

305
00:29:54,151 --> 00:29:57,243
It... It's all right, don't mind me.

306
00:29:58,914 --> 00:30:01,963
As if you were pretty enough 
to put on those airs...

307
00:30:04,493 --> 00:30:05,493
Are you Park Sotae?

308
00:30:05,603 --> 00:30:08,184
Of course I am.
Who else would I be?

309
00:30:10,663 --> 00:30:12,101
Sit.

310
00:30:15,393 --> 00:30:18,263
You know me, right?

311
00:30:18,495 --> 00:30:21,551
Yes... The son of 
Manbo Construction's...

312
00:30:21,661 --> 00:30:23,323
The heir.

313
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:29,383
- Yes... The heir, Hwang. Jeong. Shik.
- That's right.

314
00:30:32,306 --> 00:30:34,794
Where is Chairman Hong?

315
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:37,586
If you don't mind, 
why are you asking?

316
00:30:37,695 --> 00:30:42,605
I was looking for something 
Chairman Hong has.

317
00:30:43,206 --> 00:30:45,562
If you help me out,

318
00:30:50,371 --> 00:30:54,601
I'll pave your way to success.

319
00:30:56,125 --> 00:30:58,149
Where is Chairman Hong?

320
00:31:14,986 --> 00:31:17,936
<i>What's wrong with these pants?</i>

321
00:31:18,341 --> 00:31:19,982
Where is Gangmo?

322
00:31:20,204 --> 00:31:22,176
He said he had to go somewhere.

323
00:31:22,313 --> 00:31:23,374
Give me his car keys.

324
00:31:23,488 --> 00:31:24,955
Car keys?!

325
00:31:25,171 --> 00:31:26,268
You have your own car.

326
00:31:26,353 --> 00:31:29,413
You prick... Don't you know 
my father took that away from me?

327
00:31:29,743 --> 00:31:31,676
Just give me those keys.

328
00:31:34,681 --> 00:31:36,292
Let's go.

329
00:31:51,343 --> 00:31:52,514
Yes.

330
00:31:52,953 --> 00:31:54,440
<i>It's me.</i>

331
00:31:54,966 --> 00:31:56,561
As burdensome as it might be,

332
00:31:56,927 --> 00:32:02,719
you'll have to hide there
until the elections begin.

333
00:32:03,567 --> 00:32:05,603
No matter how powerful
Jo Pilyeon might be,

334
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:09,078
if that account is exposed
during his election campaign,

335
00:32:09,724 --> 00:32:11,297
he will never be able to stop that.

336
00:32:11,444 --> 00:32:13,090
All right.

337
00:32:34,061 --> 00:32:35,841
It's here.

338
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:39,552
Should I go see if he's inside?

339
00:32:39,649 --> 00:32:41,291
You stay here.

340
00:32:45,914 --> 00:32:48,975
His tongue keeps 
getting shorter, doesn't it?

341
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:54,863
He'll "pave my way to success"?

342
00:32:56,266 --> 00:32:59,595
He calls himself 
Manbo Construction's heir,

343
00:33:00,237 --> 00:33:03,607
so I guess it'll be better than 
waiting for Gangmo to make it.

344
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:05,368
Who are you?

345
00:34:13,322 --> 00:34:14,309
You...

346
00:34:15,004 --> 00:34:17,479
Chairman Hwang Taeseop's son?!

347
00:34:18,553 --> 00:34:21,056
That account... Give it back!

348
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:24,238
Chairman Hong.

349
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:28,310
Give it back!

350
00:34:28,457 --> 00:34:30,814
I'm trying to negotiate with you.

351
00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:31,875
Negotiate?!

352
00:34:31,949 --> 00:34:33,062
Yes.

353
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:35,695
Give this account to me.

354
00:34:35,806 --> 00:34:38,911
Then, I'll tell my father 
to help you out.

355
00:34:39,008 --> 00:34:40,237
Help me?!

356
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:41,178
And how?

357
00:34:41,264 --> 00:34:43,232
We'll help you avoid bankruptcy,

358
00:34:43,378 --> 00:34:45,597
anyhow... 
We'll do everything you ask.

359
00:34:45,682 --> 00:34:47,280
Start by giving that back.

360
00:34:48,243 --> 00:34:49,035
Give it back!

361
00:34:49,133 --> 00:34:50,267
No way!

362
00:34:50,523 --> 00:34:52,766
That's out of the question.

363
00:35:44,137 --> 00:35:45,625
Chairman Hong.

364
00:36:06,182 --> 00:36:09,937
So you found the account?!

365
00:36:13,351 --> 00:36:15,119
Are you all right?

366
00:36:18,933 --> 00:36:20,372
Hurry up and go. Quick!

367
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:21,652
Yes...

368
00:36:21,969 --> 00:36:25,224
Wait... Wait.

369
00:36:36,426 --> 00:36:39,084
Stop there! Stay in the car.

370
00:36:39,279 --> 00:36:41,194
Don't move a finger.

371
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:42,888
Yes...

372
00:37:46,403 --> 00:37:48,025
Did...

373
00:37:48,476 --> 00:37:52,524
anything happen inside?

374
00:37:55,110 --> 00:38:00,670
You must never 
tell anyone we came here.

375
00:38:01,046 --> 00:38:01,974
What?

376
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:06,327
It's between you and me, 
no one else.

377
00:38:06,437 --> 00:38:07,899
Got it?

378
00:38:09,935 --> 00:38:11,337
Yes.

379
00:38:29,472 --> 00:38:32,727
Chairman Hwang Taeseop 
is looking for you.

380
00:38:34,531 --> 00:38:36,372
Should I tell him you're not here?

381
00:38:39,091 --> 00:38:40,529
No.

382
00:38:40,908 --> 00:38:42,578
I'll meet him.

383
00:39:13,148 --> 00:39:14,755
Yes.

384
00:39:30,881 --> 00:39:32,942
What is the matter?

385
00:39:33,181 --> 00:39:38,440
You'll pardon me for saying this,

386
00:39:39,026 --> 00:39:44,437
but as you resemble so much 
someone I knew...

387
00:39:47,564 --> 00:39:50,021
Care for a drink?

388
00:39:58,235 --> 00:40:02,573
But that can't be possible.

389
00:40:03,382 --> 00:40:10,653
I've never heard of someone
coming back from the dead, not even...

390
00:40:10,714 --> 00:40:13,192
So is that the reason...

391
00:40:13,476 --> 00:40:15,613
you wanted to meet?

392
00:40:20,744 --> 00:40:24,007
I've been buying Manbo
Construction shares, recently,

393
00:40:24,212 --> 00:40:27,659
so I thought that was the reason.

394
00:40:29,373 --> 00:40:32,432
You'll soon end up on top of the sector.

395
00:40:32,633 --> 00:40:35,954
Those shares will bring us a nice profit.

396
00:40:38,874 --> 00:40:46,937
But... That daughter of yours,
will she become your heir?

397
00:40:49,785 --> 00:40:53,911
People don't usually go to private lenders 
accompanied by their daughters.

398
00:40:54,029 --> 00:40:56,007
<i>Jeongyeon...</i>

399
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,884
Didn't you miss her?

400
00:41:03,974 --> 00:41:10,628
How did you manage to endure all this time, 
without seeing your daughter?

401
00:41:20,155 --> 00:41:21,018
Gyeongok.

402
00:41:21,112 --> 00:41:24,493
The Gyeongok you knew is dead.

403
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:29,351
And the same goes for the mother
who gave birth to Jeongyeon.

404
00:41:30,875 --> 00:41:33,987
What are you,
ruthless or just foolish?

405
00:41:34,235 --> 00:41:39,759
Think blood ties can so easily be cut?

406
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:45,784
Wasn't it you who turned me
into such a ruthless, foolish woman?

407
00:41:46,209 --> 00:41:49,070
You made me what I am today!

408
00:41:51,777 --> 00:41:55,229
Don't tell anything 
about me to Jeongyeon.

409
00:41:55,418 --> 00:41:59,902
<i>Jeongyeon will soon get married.</i>

410
00:42:01,558 --> 00:42:06,280
Her engagement is tomorrow.

411
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:16,043
It's the daughter you
so painfully gave birth to.

412
00:42:17,226 --> 00:42:21,255
Thought you should know.

413
00:42:48,453 --> 00:42:51,349
You're quite drunk.

414
00:42:58,054 --> 00:43:00,808
You still weren't sleeping?

415
00:43:01,117 --> 00:43:03,610
Be it money or people,

416
00:43:03,893 --> 00:43:07,465
the more you see, 
the thirstier you will become.

417
00:43:07,607 --> 00:43:11,425
Did seeing your daughter
do the same thing to you?

418
00:43:11,626 --> 00:43:13,860
He said my Jeongyeon...

419
00:43:15,157 --> 00:43:17,903
will soon get married?!

420
00:43:21,171 --> 00:43:26,939
You know how people 
like us make money?

421
00:43:27,459 --> 00:43:29,380
<i>By quickly gathering 
market information,</i>

422
00:43:29,477 --> 00:43:30,934
<i>abiding by a strict negotiating formula,</i>

423
00:43:31,052 --> 00:43:33,389
showing a relentless thirst for money,

424
00:43:33,498 --> 00:43:37,256
and by a neverending behind-the-scenes
struggle to achieve one's goals!

425
00:43:38,497 --> 00:43:43,923
But there is something
all this know-how lacks.

426
00:43:47,717 --> 00:43:49,844
A human touch.

427
00:43:50,991 --> 00:43:55,471
Money and compassion
never go hand in hand.

428
00:43:57,552 --> 00:44:05,696
I hope you won't let compassion
sway you enough to disappoint me.

429
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:10,034
I apologize.

430
00:44:11,301 --> 00:44:14,599
You will never see me like this again.

431
00:44:58,152 --> 00:45:00,374
Your engagement is tomorrow.

432
00:45:01,343 --> 00:45:04,352
Drink this and go to sleep.

433
00:45:23,209 --> 00:45:25,230
Play me another song.

434
00:45:26,476 --> 00:45:27,539
What?

435
00:45:27,795 --> 00:45:29,251
With the piano.

436
00:46:46,147 --> 00:46:49,059
Are you all right?

437
00:46:49,236 --> 00:46:50,857
Why do you ask?

438
00:46:51,557 --> 00:46:55,340
She's getting engaged tomorrow...

439
00:46:55,802 --> 00:46:58,026
If she's getting engaged, then what?

440
00:46:58,771 --> 00:47:01,512
- You really...
- Do me a favor.

441
00:47:02,801 --> 00:47:04,339
If you're just going to
wag your tongue, leave.

442
00:47:04,481 --> 00:47:08,747
Keep acting like that 
and this will kill you!

443
00:47:08,843 --> 00:47:11,419
Think people would die so easily?

444
00:47:13,645 --> 00:47:16,425
I saw my mother 
die before my very eyes,

445
00:47:19,228 --> 00:47:22,162
lost my siblings,

446
00:47:24,587 --> 00:47:30,945
and even had to send away 
my little brother,

447
00:47:33,205 --> 00:47:35,287
but I went on living 
without blinking once.

448
00:47:35,748 --> 00:47:36,743
Gangmo...

449
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:38,055
From now on,

450
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:46,839
I'll only think about
making my sister's life better.

451
00:47:50,234 --> 00:47:53,467
You make me go crazy, really...

452
00:48:43,675 --> 00:48:47,173
You look like a fairy.

453
00:48:48,143 --> 00:48:49,633
Hold it, you brat!

454
00:48:49,712 --> 00:48:51,319
I'm holding it.

455
00:48:51,479 --> 00:48:54,579
I hadn't been home in ages, and look...

456
00:48:54,975 --> 00:48:57,838
- Is it done?
- Yes, it's ready.

457
00:48:58,228 --> 00:49:03,082
Oh my! Aigoo!
Look how pretty our Agasshi looks!

458
00:49:03,209 --> 00:49:05,184
Mom, know how much this dress costs?

459
00:49:05,267 --> 00:49:06,656
Would be strange 
if she didn't look pretty.

460
00:49:06,763 --> 00:49:10,986
- Aigoo, you really...
- But she does look pretty.

461
00:49:37,827 --> 00:49:39,624
I look strange, don't I?

462
00:49:40,536 --> 00:49:43,565
N...No...

463
00:49:45,327 --> 00:49:47,362
You look great.

464
00:49:50,379 --> 00:49:51,943
Here.

465
00:50:31,339 --> 00:50:33,315
It's time.

466
00:52:53,463 --> 00:52:54,539
Director.

467
00:52:54,847 --> 00:52:55,450
Yes.

468
00:52:55,533 --> 00:52:57,032
I need to tell you something.

469
00:52:58,088 --> 00:52:59,436
What is it?

470
00:53:00,702 --> 00:53:03,092
Hong Gipyo is dead.

471
00:53:04,697 --> 00:53:07,388
What are you saying?

472
00:53:07,519 --> 00:53:09,429
Why would Hong Gipyo be dead?

473
00:53:09,684 --> 00:53:11,471
I think he might have been murdered.

474
00:53:11,565 --> 00:53:14,972
What?! Murdered?

475
00:53:44,097 --> 00:53:49,346
<i>Manbo Construction
~ LEE GANGMO ~</i>

476
00:53:49,928 --> 00:53:52,506
This is no laughing matter.

477
00:53:52,765 --> 00:53:55,423
I'm sure it has something
to do with that account.

478
00:53:55,513 --> 00:53:58,065
Start investigating this.

479
00:53:58,148 --> 00:53:59,787
All right.

480
00:54:03,095 --> 00:54:04,841
Jo Pilyeon!

481
00:54:05,903 --> 00:54:07,369
What brings you here?

482
00:54:07,548 --> 00:54:09,074
You must have heard about Hong Gipyo?!

483
00:54:09,179 --> 00:54:10,481
And?

484
00:54:11,177 --> 00:54:13,534
Came here to tell me the news?

485
00:54:13,626 --> 00:54:17,207
I knew you were 
spying on Chairman Hong.

486
00:54:17,621 --> 00:54:18,403
What?

487
00:54:18,502 --> 00:54:22,318
You must have been after 
that account's copy?

488
00:54:22,669 --> 00:54:24,070
Look, Min Honggi...

489
00:54:24,164 --> 00:54:28,381
I want to believe you didn't do this.

490
00:54:28,759 --> 00:54:33,030
Because a KCIA director
killing for his own means...

491
00:54:33,479 --> 00:54:36,839
would ruin the name 
of our entire agency.

492
00:54:41,979 --> 00:54:45,759
Sure... Go on prattling all you want.

493
00:54:46,221 --> 00:54:52,212
I'll pay you back for all that
when the by-elections come.

494
00:54:55,239 --> 00:54:56,643
Aww... How scary.

495
00:54:56,790 --> 00:55:00,162
What kind of motherless 
prick could do that?

496
00:55:02,492 --> 00:55:03,734
Is there anything to drink?

497
00:55:03,864 --> 00:55:06,029
Why are you looking for
the bottle, all of a sudden?

498
00:55:06,195 --> 00:55:09,010
We might have been rivals,

499
00:55:09,342 --> 00:55:13,588
but seeing his life end so
violently was not pleasant at all.

500
00:55:13,707 --> 00:55:19,641
They should just catch that despicable
killer and give him the death sentence.

501
00:55:21,889 --> 00:55:25,517
<i>Eat slowly, will you?</i>

502
00:55:26,526 --> 00:55:27,531
Chairman.

503
00:55:27,641 --> 00:55:31,056
Come out, detectives are here.

504
00:55:32,766 --> 00:55:35,238
- Detectives?
- Yes.

505
00:55:39,296 --> 00:55:41,177
Here he comes.

506
00:55:46,329 --> 00:55:49,808
What is the matter?

507
00:55:51,213 --> 00:55:53,889
Lee Gangmo lives here, right?

508
00:55:54,097 --> 00:55:55,296
That's right, but why?

509
00:55:55,426 --> 00:56:00,086
He's suspected of the
murder of Chairman Hong Gipyo.

510
00:56:04,073 --> 00:56:07,196
What are you talking about?

511
00:56:07,385 --> 00:56:09,144
Gangmo is suspected of murder?!

512
00:56:09,238 --> 00:56:13,343
We found clear evidence
at the murder scene.

513
00:56:13,592 --> 00:56:14,988
<i>Is he home?</i>

514
00:56:15,130 --> 00:56:17,223
<i>He still hasn't come back?</i>

515
00:56:17,794 --> 00:56:19,175
Where is Lee Gangmo's room?

516
00:56:19,294 --> 00:56:21,111
This way...

517
00:56:28,848 --> 00:56:31,013
What is all this about?

518
00:56:31,244 --> 00:56:33,639
Gangmo killed someone?!

519
00:56:33,987 --> 00:56:37,315
<i>See? You never know people's true colors 
until things like this happen.</i>

520
00:56:37,398 --> 00:56:40,083
<i>Aww... How horrible.</i>

521
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:53,613
- Agasshi.
- Quick, come.

522
00:56:54,877 --> 00:56:56,495
Murder?!

523
00:56:56,687 --> 00:56:58,212
Who killed who?

524
00:56:58,319 --> 00:57:00,591
Chairman Hong Gipyo died.

525
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:04,295
They're accusing you of his murder!

526
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:08,199
It's not you...

527
00:57:08,418 --> 00:57:10,020
Right?

528
00:57:11,192 --> 00:57:13,617
You would never do that.

529
00:57:15,038 --> 00:57:16,184
Where are you going?

530
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:18,387
I'll have to explain to them 
I'm not the killer.

531
00:57:18,509 --> 00:57:20,256
They said they found clear evidence.

532
00:57:20,409 --> 00:57:22,610
I didn't even meet
Chairman Hong, what evidence?

533
00:57:22,725 --> 00:57:23,847
Just hide.

534
00:57:23,951 --> 00:57:27,960
And then what, convince everyone 
that I'm the murderer?

535
00:57:28,031 --> 00:57:29,723
They said they have evidence!

536
00:57:29,912 --> 00:57:33,698
What if you're really framed for murder?

537
00:57:38,512 --> 00:57:42,930
You'll always have time
to turn yourself in later.

538
00:57:50,016 --> 00:57:51,838
<i>Take this.</i>

539
00:57:57,998 --> 00:58:00,435
Take it!

540
00:58:07,213 --> 00:58:09,504
Don't skip your meals,

541
00:58:09,943 --> 00:58:12,721
and never let the police find you.

542
00:58:13,928 --> 00:58:15,702
Thank you, Agasshi.

543
00:58:23,068 --> 00:58:24,089
Gangmo...

544
00:58:24,204 --> 00:58:26,274
Run away.

545
00:58:28,971 --> 00:58:29,669
It's him.

546
00:58:29,775 --> 00:58:32,988
- Gangmo, quick!
- Lee Gangmo!

547
00:58:38,737 --> 00:58:40,961
Gangmo...

548
00:58:45,852 --> 00:58:46,806
<i>Hurry up and speak.</i>

549
00:58:46,948 --> 00:58:48,881
<i>Where is Lee Gangmo hiding?</i>

550
00:58:49,042 --> 00:58:50,955
I told you I don't know.

551
00:58:51,384 --> 00:58:54,081
You were talking to each other!

552
00:58:54,199 --> 00:58:56,139
I really don't know, I told you!

553
00:58:56,222 --> 00:58:58,050
Young lady...

554
00:58:58,292 --> 00:59:00,889
Want to do time in the can 
for concealing a suspect?

555
00:59:00,988 --> 00:59:03,043
<i>She said she doesn't know, so stop it.</i>

556
00:59:04,037 --> 00:59:05,799
And who are you?

557
00:59:08,201 --> 00:59:09,762
Get up.

558
00:59:11,466 --> 00:59:13,001
Look.

559
00:59:13,122 --> 00:59:14,991
I asked you a question.

560
00:59:15,369 --> 00:59:17,075
I'm her fiance.

561
00:59:17,226 --> 00:59:18,149
What?

562
00:59:18,409 --> 00:59:19,505
Fiance?

563
00:59:19,699 --> 00:59:23,472
If you want to detain her, talk with 
Director Jo Pilyeon of the KCIA first.

564
00:59:23,756 --> 00:59:25,462
He's my father.

565
00:59:29,131 --> 00:59:33,270
KCIA's... Director Jo Pilyeon?!

566
00:59:34,517 --> 00:59:36,994
I said stay put!

567
00:59:38,664 --> 00:59:40,176
Let go.

568
00:59:40,289 --> 00:59:42,065
I can walk by myself.

569
00:59:42,548 --> 00:59:45,259
How much longer are you going
to keep protecting Lee Gangmo?

570
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:48,453
Think what you're doing 
will change anything?

571
00:59:48,867 --> 00:59:52,314
Gangmo is a murderer, 
he killed a man.

572
00:59:52,629 --> 00:59:54,246
Careful what you say.

573
00:59:54,342 --> 00:59:55,930
Take a good look.

574
00:59:56,509 --> 00:59:58,116
I'm your fiance.

575
00:59:58,225 --> 00:59:59,396
We're about to get married.

576
00:59:59,479 --> 01:00:01,943
Gangmo is more important to me, now.

577
01:00:03,063 --> 01:00:03,631
What?

578
01:00:03,737 --> 01:00:09,091
I will never let them
frame him for murder.

579
01:00:09,789 --> 01:00:12,143
I'll make sure that doesn't happen.

580
01:00:21,154 --> 01:00:22,639
Oppa.

581
01:00:25,164 --> 01:00:26,403
Have you had dinner?

582
01:00:26,492 --> 01:00:27,749
Have any leftovers?

583
01:00:27,850 --> 01:00:30,721
Wait a moment, I'll warm them up.

584
01:00:38,694 --> 01:00:40,067
<i>And now a report.</i>

585
01:00:40,268 --> 01:00:41,888
The chairman of
Daeryuk Construction, Hong Gipyo,

586
01:00:41,995 --> 01:00:43,758
has been murdered.

587
01:00:43,876 --> 01:00:46,477
<i>Chairman Hong's body was found 
this morning in a cottage...</i>

588
01:00:46,591 --> 01:00:50,315
<i>in Gyeonggi Province
by one of the tenants.</i>

589
01:00:50,424 --> 01:00:53,503
<i>Citing clear evidence against him, 
the police are looking...</i>

590
01:00:53,562 --> 01:00:57,709
<i>for murder suspect Lee Gangmo.</i>

591
01:00:59,472 --> 01:01:00,797
Miju!

592
01:01:08,431 --> 01:01:09,847
It's not you...

593
01:01:10,273 --> 01:01:12,881
You didn't do that, right?

594
01:01:15,910 --> 01:01:17,246
You didn't kill him, right?

595
01:01:17,353 --> 01:01:20,485
You would never do that, right? 
It's not you!

596
01:01:20,579 --> 01:01:21,683
It's not me.

597
01:01:21,801 --> 01:01:22,818
Trust me, Miju.

598
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:25,264
I didn't do it.

599
01:01:26,707 --> 01:01:27,975
I know.

600
01:01:28,068 --> 01:01:30,290
<i>You wouldn't be capable of that.</i>

601
01:01:30,528 --> 01:01:34,680
You'd never kill the chairman.

602
01:01:40,005 --> 01:01:42,667
But why are they 
calling you the culprit?

603
01:01:42,773 --> 01:01:45,852
Someone fabricated that evidence.

604
01:01:45,964 --> 01:01:47,306
And who is that?

605
01:01:47,402 --> 01:01:49,362
Why did he do that to you?

606
01:01:49,457 --> 01:01:51,551
If the police can't find him,

607
01:01:51,675 --> 01:01:53,390
I will.

608
01:01:53,597 --> 01:01:55,608
Oppa...

609
01:01:57,524 --> 01:01:59,346
Don't you worry, Miju.

610
01:01:59,725 --> 01:02:01,617
Everything will go well.

611
01:02:04,008 --> 01:02:05,866
Until your innocence is proven, Oppa.

612
01:02:05,937 --> 01:02:08,147
Don't go anywhere, I'll hide you here.

613
01:02:08,279 --> 01:02:11,373
If you stay here, nobody will know.

614
01:02:12,221 --> 01:02:13,969
All right.

615
01:02:47,477 --> 01:02:51,957
That Lee Gangmo must have
the account we're looking for.

616
01:02:52,481 --> 01:02:55,130
We must catch him before they do.

617
01:03:01,917 --> 01:03:03,203
Hello?

618
01:03:03,408 --> 01:03:04,485
<i>It's me, Shideok.</i>

619
01:03:04,574 --> 01:03:06,778
Hey... What happened to you?

620
01:03:06,883 --> 01:03:10,089
Someone framed me on purpose.

621
01:03:10,284 --> 01:03:11,331
<i>Gangmo.</i>

622
01:03:11,425 --> 01:03:15,388
<i>That day, Jeongshik went
looking for Chairman Hong.</i>

623
01:03:16,678 --> 01:03:18,358
<i>He left with Park Sotae,</i>

624
01:03:18,464 --> 01:03:20,593
<i>so he must know what's up.</i>

625
01:03:30,461 --> 01:03:31,762
You.

626
01:03:32,661 --> 01:03:33,832
You know, right?

627
01:03:34,033 --> 01:03:41,256
I really don't know
what you're referring to.

628
01:03:42,629 --> 01:03:44,829
The man who murdered Chairman Hong...

629
01:03:46,553 --> 01:03:48,188
is me.

630
01:03:54,218 --> 01:03:55,910
Tell me about it...

631
01:03:56,273 --> 01:03:59,352
I couldn't sleep all night.

632
01:04:00,287 --> 01:04:03,433
Forget all my shortcomings, but when 
it comes to reporting wrongdoings,

633
01:04:03,531 --> 01:04:05,617
I'm second to none.

634
01:04:13,153 --> 01:04:14,608
Open it.

635
01:04:21,296 --> 01:04:23,286
That money...

636
01:04:24,279 --> 01:04:29,582
should be more than enough to hide 
until they catch Lee Gangmo.

637
01:04:31,064 --> 01:04:32,531
But, you know?

638
01:04:33,297 --> 01:04:37,334
Gangmo and I are really close.

639
01:04:37,985 --> 01:04:42,741
And money doesn't last forever.

640
01:04:43,356 --> 01:04:47,662
I told you that your life 
was in my hands, right?

641
01:04:49,862 --> 01:04:52,276
Take a good look.

642
01:04:52,985 --> 01:05:00,177
Because I, Hwang Jeongshik, 
will soon take over Manbo Construction.

643
01:05:03,354 --> 01:05:08,688
You will never get 
a chance like this again.

644
01:05:14,424 --> 01:05:21,136
You know where 
Gangmo is hiding, right?

645
01:05:24,522 --> 01:05:26,628
Where is Lee Gangmo?

646
01:05:42,416 --> 01:05:43,617
<i>Around it...</i>

647
01:05:43,711 --> 01:05:46,472
<i>Go look if there are any
eye-witnesses around the place.</i>

648
01:05:46,692 --> 01:05:48,158
All right.

649
01:05:48,910 --> 01:05:50,228
How about the flyers?

650
01:05:50,311 --> 01:05:52,523
They'll soon be ready.

651
01:05:54,262 --> 01:05:56,451
How can I help you?

652
01:05:57,634 --> 01:06:00,670
You're searching for 
Lee Gangmo, right?

653
01:06:00,766 --> 01:06:03,230
The man who killed 
Chairman Hong Gipyo.

654
01:06:06,448 --> 01:06:09,548
You know where he is?

655
01:06:20,192 --> 01:06:22,321
Do you know where is Park Sotae,
the man who lived here?

656
01:06:22,428 --> 01:06:23,847
Can't say.

657
01:06:24,450 --> 01:06:28,468
There have been so many
people renting this place.

658
01:06:32,691 --> 01:06:36,464
No contacts of note 
with Lee Gangmo yet.

01:06:38,984 --> 01:06:41,194
Continue to keep an eye 
on his acquaintances.

660
01:06:41,407 --> 01:06:43,228
I'm sure he'll show up.

661
01:06:43,465 --> 01:06:45,547
All right.

662
01:06:51,107 --> 01:06:53,794
Chairman Hong asked me for this...

663
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:55,994
You take care of it.

01:07:44,292 --> 01:07:47,408
Did you go to that cottage
on the day Chairman Hong died?

679
01:07:47,546 --> 01:07:49,497
What are you going to do,
report me to the police?

680
01:07:49,570 --> 01:07:53,633
Those bastards are trying to
use my brother as a scapegoat!

681
01:07:54,069 --> 01:07:56,081
<i>I have a way to get Gangmo out.</i>

682
01:07:56,170 --> 01:07:59,566
<i>Don't get angry if who
you're waiting for doesn't come.</i>

683
01:07:59,767 --> 01:08:02,902
They'll eventually come,
if you keep waiting.

684
01:08:03,008 --> 01:08:05,332
What are you,
trying to rile me up?

685
01:08:05,735 --> 01:08:06,906
Is this what you were looking for?

686
01:08:06,977 --> 01:08:09,437
Why do you have this?

687
01:08:09,721 --> 01:08:12,619
Did you kill Chairman Hong?
