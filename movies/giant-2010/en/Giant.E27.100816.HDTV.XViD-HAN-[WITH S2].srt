- Episode 27 -

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,947
- Then...
- See you again.

5
00:00:16,328 --> 00:00:17,817
Yes?

6
00:00:18,201 --> 00:00:20,591
<i>Hangang Construction, right?</i>

7
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:21,932
Yes, that's right.

8
00:00:22,088 --> 00:00:23,712
Who am I speaking to?

9
00:00:23,821 --> 00:00:25,550
<i>Manbo Construction here.</i>

10
00:00:25,662 --> 00:00:29,147
<i>I'm Director of Planning
Hwang Jeongyeon.</i>

11
00:00:31,893 --> 00:00:34,309
Is the president there?

12
00:00:35,864 --> 00:00:39,975
I have a business proposal for him,
can you get him on the phone?

13
00:00:43,214 --> 00:00:44,524
Hello?

14
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,939
Are you listening?

15
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:49,286
<i>Hello?</i>

16
00:01:03,544 --> 00:01:05,536
- Aren't you picking up the phone?
- Hey... Don't!

17
00:01:06,106 --> 00:01:07,405
<i>Hello?</i>

18
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:09,355
<i>Am I speaking to Hangang Construction?</i>

19
00:01:09,481 --> 00:01:12,822
Y...es...
H...How may I help you?

20
00:01:12,935 --> 00:01:16,227
<i>I'm Manbo Construction
Chief of Planning Jo Minwoo.</i>

21
00:01:17,331 --> 00:01:19,620
Hey.. Hey!
It's Jo Minwoo... Jo Minwoo!

22
00:01:19,718 --> 00:01:21,849
Manbo Construction.

23
00:01:23,493 --> 00:01:27,640
What should I do?
Should I just hang up?

24
00:01:31,577 --> 00:01:35,877
<i>I'd like to discuss a contract
proposal with the president.</i>

25
00:01:36,618 --> 00:01:39,251
We don't do business
with Manbo Construction.

26
00:01:39,629 --> 00:01:41,082
Excuse me?

27
00:01:41,342 --> 00:01:43,290
<i>Don't call us again.</i>

28
00:01:45,629 --> 00:01:46,791
Hello?

29
00:01:46,936 --> 00:01:48,531
Listen!

30
00:02:07,771 --> 00:02:10,880
Hey... What if they come looking for us?

31
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:14,732
If they learn you're alive,
it'll be trouble.

32
00:02:21,225 --> 00:02:23,433
They still aren't picking up the phone?

33
00:02:30,688 --> 00:02:34,406
Hangang Construction said
they won't deal with us.

34
00:02:34,595 --> 00:02:36,207
What's the reason?

35
00:02:36,425 --> 00:02:37,911
I can't say.

36
00:02:38,227 --> 00:02:41,335
Looks like I'll have to
meet their president firsthand.

37
00:02:41,466 --> 00:02:42,777
No need to do that.

38
00:02:42,904 --> 00:02:47,035
I'll handle that, so keep
checking the construction site.

39
00:02:47,134 --> 00:02:49,946
It would be much wiser if
you left this issue to me, and...

40
00:02:50,033 --> 00:02:52,705
<i>You can't predict what kind of
conditions they'll be throwing at us.</i>

41
00:02:52,793 --> 00:02:57,368
Think that is something you
could decide on your own?

42
00:02:58,443 --> 00:03:01,143
As you prefer, then.

43
00:03:07,273 --> 00:03:09,280
Shideok, you go meet him.

44
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:10,367
Me?

45
00:03:10,556 --> 00:03:12,502
There's no reason why a small
firm like Hangang Construction...

46
00:03:12,648 --> 00:03:15,248
would refuse to do business with us.

47
00:03:15,425 --> 00:03:19,245
Meet with their president
and find out what's going on.

48
00:03:19,463 --> 00:03:21,370
All right.

49
00:03:30,271 --> 00:03:35,472
<i>So the area under our control
is here, here, and here.</i>

50
00:03:35,617 --> 00:03:40,759
And the contract we just
signed today would be this area.

51
00:03:41,398 --> 00:03:45,001
If we keep this up, won't we
end up dominating this entire area?

52
00:03:51,462 --> 00:03:52,755
Not here.

53
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,093
This is... what...
Manbo Construction's?!

54
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:57,113
Forget all the rest.

55
00:03:57,243 --> 00:03:59,684
<i>- South Gyeongsang Province -</i>

56
00:04:00,726 --> 00:04:03,861
Once we get our hands
on this, it's game over.

57
00:04:06,183 --> 00:04:08,623
We unplugged the phone earlier, who...

58
00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:11,833
Had to order lunch,
so I plugged it back.

59
00:04:14,477 --> 00:04:16,017
Yes?

60
00:04:16,685 --> 00:04:18,327
Hyung!

61
00:04:21,493 --> 00:04:24,713
Gangmo, I don't think taking
those highway projects...

62
00:04:24,829 --> 00:04:29,797
away from Manbo Construction
will be that easy.

63
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,594
There is another big shot
watching Hwang Taeseop's back.

64
00:04:34,715 --> 00:04:37,157
Commissioner of the Seoul
City Council, Han Myeongseok.

65
00:04:37,395 --> 00:04:38,477
You knew?

66
00:04:38,588 --> 00:04:39,976
Yeah.

67
00:04:43,594 --> 00:04:49,179
I'm well aware of all the difficulties
you're facing with the highway project.

68
00:04:49,477 --> 00:04:57,367
Hearing such kind words from someone
like you can only comfort me.

69
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:01,160
Well... Should the need arise, we can
discuss possible budget increments.

70
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,814
Commissioner.

71
00:05:02,967 --> 00:05:05,422
Thank you.

72
00:05:09,272 --> 00:05:11,029
It's a golf club membership.

73
00:05:11,203 --> 00:05:15,721
It's in the outskirts of Seoul,
and the view is wonderful.

74
00:05:16,738 --> 00:05:18,510
Here... Shall we have a drink?

75
00:05:18,612 --> 00:05:20,409
<i>Sure.</i>

76
00:05:22,142 --> 00:05:25,419
<i>They might have
differing political views,</i>

77
00:05:25,529 --> 00:05:28,788
<i>but have been on good terms
for quite some time.</i>

78
00:05:31,441 --> 00:05:33,329
As long as Commissioner Han
keeps his post,

79
00:05:33,475 --> 00:05:37,350
Chairman Hwang
will be protected as well.

80
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:40,883
Is there any way I could help you?

81
00:05:41,115 --> 00:05:45,214
You'll already have enough on your plate
worrying about Jo Pilyeon's elections.

82
00:05:45,664 --> 00:05:48,246
I'll take care of Manbo Construction.

83
00:05:50,763 --> 00:05:52,527
Do you have a plan?

84
00:05:52,642 --> 00:05:56,733
I'll create a rift between
Hwang Taeseop and Han Myeongseok.

85
00:05:56,911 --> 00:05:59,871
- That's easier said than...
- Their political views differ,

86
00:06:00,001 --> 00:06:03,154
but despite that,
they're still on good terms...

87
00:06:05,042 --> 00:06:07,207
Isn't it interesting, Hyung?

88
00:06:08,587 --> 00:06:10,627
Be careful, Gangmo.

89
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:14,476
You can't expose your identity, yet.

90
00:06:20,516 --> 00:06:21,914
<i>And that's when the fat lady sings!</i>

91
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:23,715
Aigoo, don't tell me...

92
00:06:23,788 --> 00:06:26,663
It's a checkmate, you've lost.

93
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:27,705
I knew that move would work.

94
00:06:27,792 --> 00:06:30,632
Ahh... Look at what I have to witness...

95
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,082
What do you call this path? Uh?

96
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:35,230
I could just go for the kill, like this.

97
00:06:35,404 --> 00:06:36,697
Ready... Done!

98
00:06:36,798 --> 00:06:40,311
Wait... I didn't see that before?
When did it suddenly...

99
00:06:40,405 --> 00:06:42,655
- Go back one move.
- Go back what, you old fart?

100
00:06:42,751 --> 00:06:46,429
- Old fart?! To an elder, you sorry little...
- How can you pull such tricks, you old fart?

101
00:06:46,537 --> 00:06:50,584
- You really... Ehh! Damned old fart!
- Didn't you have parents, you insolent twat?

102
00:06:50,757 --> 00:06:52,632
Excuse me.

103
00:06:57,179 --> 00:06:59,575
I'm here on behalf of Manbo
Construction for the contract issue.

104
00:06:59,668 --> 00:07:00,882
Ahh... Is that so?

105
00:07:00,976 --> 00:07:03,755
Let's see...
Where was the contract again?

106
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:04,930
Hey... Hey!

107
00:07:05,017 --> 00:07:07,781
<i>Get up, you fool.</i>

108
00:07:07,963 --> 00:07:11,679
So... You're going to
deal with us, after all?

109
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:14,786
Here it is. This contract...

110
00:07:15,025 --> 00:07:19,789
You give it a good read,
seal right here, and it's a done deal.

111
00:07:21,155 --> 00:07:26,060
Then, all I have to do is seal it here?

112
00:07:26,159 --> 00:07:29,541
That's why they call it a contract.
Want to write an essay before you sign?

113
00:07:29,672 --> 00:07:31,918
Right... Hey... Hey!

114
00:07:32,069 --> 00:07:35,206
<i>Hey! The hell
are you doing down there?</i>

115
00:07:35,337 --> 00:07:38,126
Get up... I said get up!
What are you doing?

116
00:07:38,228 --> 00:07:42,673
Just in case,
I brought the director's seal!

117
00:07:42,832 --> 00:07:44,864
So I can just seal here?

118
00:07:44,936 --> 00:07:47,561
- So you're here on an errand?
- Yes.

119
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:51,877
You did look a tad on the soggy side...

120
00:07:51,981 --> 00:07:54,320
Can I borrow your inkpad a moment?

121
00:07:54,436 --> 00:07:56,659
No can do!

122
00:07:57,763 --> 00:07:59,402
The hell is wrong with you?

123
00:07:59,496 --> 00:08:00,188
Out!

124
00:08:00,305 --> 00:08:02,590
We're not doing
business with you, get out!

125
00:08:04,377 --> 00:08:06,624
Pa...Park Sotae?!

126
00:08:06,715 --> 00:08:10,231
Saute or Flambe, we're not doing
business with you. Get out of here.

127
00:08:10,361 --> 00:08:12,181
Get the hell out, quick!

128
00:08:12,253 --> 00:08:14,316
Out... Out!

129
00:08:14,908 --> 00:08:16,713
What is this?

130
00:08:16,808 --> 00:08:18,214
What are you doing here?

131
00:08:18,315 --> 00:08:22,353
You little... I'm one of Hangang
Construction's founding directors!

132
00:08:22,438 --> 00:08:24,502
Hyungnim, Hyungnim!
We must kick him out!

133
00:08:24,609 --> 00:08:25,709
Wait a moment.

134
00:08:25,782 --> 00:08:28,803
Why, is this gentleman here a
particularly bad person, or something?

135
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,099
He's much worse than me!

136
00:08:31,186 --> 00:08:32,525
- Even worse than you?!
- Yes!

137
00:08:32,629 --> 00:08:35,796
Then he really must
be deluxe twat material!

138
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:38,897
Pick him up!

139
00:08:40,161 --> 00:08:43,749
<i>We must kick him out!</i>

140
00:08:44,112 --> 00:08:45,341
<i>Out... Out...</i>

141
00:08:45,413 --> 00:08:48,792
You little bastard, how dare you...

142
00:08:52,555 --> 00:08:54,692
<i>Serves you right, you twat!</i>

143
00:08:54,798 --> 00:08:57,429
We're never going to
deal with Manbo Construction,

144
00:08:57,538 --> 00:09:00,408
so don't even think about prancing
around here again, is that clear?

145
00:09:01,164 --> 00:09:02,456
Hey... Park Sotae!

146
00:09:02,573 --> 00:09:04,351
Park Sotae!

147
00:09:04,525 --> 00:09:06,504
Hey! Park Sotae!

148
00:09:06,669 --> 00:09:07,773
Open the door!

149
00:09:07,904 --> 00:09:13,198
Until I get to meet your boss
I'm not moving, just so you know!

150
00:09:13,307 --> 00:09:16,692
Open this damned door, Park Sotae!

151
00:09:22,402 --> 00:09:24,804
My boss is abroad on a business trip?!

152
00:09:24,901 --> 00:09:26,737
So don't even fart
in our direction, you twat.

153
00:09:26,851 --> 00:09:30,249
If I spot you around here again,
next time I'll pick up water from the toilet!

154
00:09:30,325 --> 00:09:32,498
Have no use for this,
so you can have it.

155
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:36,083
You little...

156
00:09:36,199 --> 00:09:39,497
Park Sotae! You're dead.

157
00:09:42,547 --> 00:09:43,927
Yes?

158
00:09:44,944 --> 00:09:46,165
How did it go?

159
00:09:46,288 --> 00:09:48,194
Did you meet the president?

160
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:50,788
<i>They said he's abroad
on a business trip.</i>

161
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,241
What?

162
00:09:52,404 --> 00:09:56,483
<i>But that Park Sotae is working here.</i>

163
00:09:57,005 --> 00:09:58,642
Park Sotae?

164
00:09:58,821 --> 00:10:00,768
The one who framed Gangmo?

165
00:10:00,928 --> 00:10:02,613
<i>Yes.</i>

166
00:10:04,473 --> 00:10:06,834
They could have lied
about his business trip.

167
00:10:06,948 --> 00:10:11,198
Keep waiting there, and if
anything happens, give me a call.

168
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:39,297
I'm not someone you can impress
with a good performance alone.

169
00:10:39,398 --> 00:10:43,048
I don't plan to only
bank on royalties, either.

170
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:45,004
So your future business plans?

171
00:10:45,148 --> 00:10:48,213
We now plan to join forces
with other corporations.

172
00:10:48,358 --> 00:10:51,510
Do you already have
anyone in mind, by chance?

173
00:10:54,545 --> 00:10:56,390
Manbo Construction would be perfect.

174
00:10:56,564 --> 00:10:59,644
I could introduce them to you myself.

175
00:10:59,891 --> 00:11:04,191
Manbo Construction is the sole
exception in our partnership plans.

176
00:11:06,094 --> 00:11:07,386
And what's the reason?

177
00:11:07,495 --> 00:11:08,863
Because they lead the sector.

178
00:11:09,071 --> 00:11:10,648
What's that supposed to mean?

179
00:11:10,738 --> 00:11:12,373
If you want to run a successful
business, it's natural you should...

180
00:11:12,445 --> 00:11:13,753
<i>You could never defeat a giant...</i>

181
00:11:13,883 --> 00:11:16,701
as long as you grovel at their feet.

182
00:11:16,905 --> 00:11:20,924
So you want to defeat
Manbo Construction?

183
00:11:23,529 --> 00:11:27,374
And you believe it's a realistic fight?

184
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,962
If you'll excuse me, I'll get going.

185
00:11:39,692 --> 00:11:42,254
Will you just let him go for it?

186
00:11:42,353 --> 00:11:43,580
What if I let him?

187
00:11:43,726 --> 00:11:46,747
We are one of Manbo Construction's
major shareholders.

188
00:11:46,834 --> 00:11:51,555
What are you, afraid that young fella
will rise above Manbo Construction?

189
00:11:52,529 --> 00:11:54,488
It's not what I meant...

190
00:11:54,594 --> 00:11:56,544
It's a hopeless fight.

191
00:11:56,638 --> 00:12:01,223
However, that fighting spirit
moving him to fight rocks with eggs...

192
00:12:01,319 --> 00:12:03,276
is quite intriguing.

193
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:09,532
But then it's only natural that the
eggs will break, along with his company.

194
00:12:10,119 --> 00:12:16,007
If he goes belly up using my money,
he will dearly regret it.

195
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:20,085
Let him fight on his own.

196
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:26,945
We'll have to wait and see how
he faces off with that giant.

197
00:12:27,178 --> 00:12:29,574
As you wish, Sir.

198
00:13:00,566 --> 00:13:02,840
Did you really come here to study?

199
00:13:03,232 --> 00:13:05,353
Chief!

200
00:13:08,229 --> 00:13:11,120
Let's concentrate, shall we?

201
00:13:13,719 --> 00:13:16,509
Forget that and follow me.

202
00:13:42,093 --> 00:13:43,155
Hey...

203
00:13:43,257 --> 00:13:47,164
Can't a woman eat
a little more gracefully?

204
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:50,927
Ehh... Everyone eats the same way.

205
00:13:51,479 --> 00:13:54,667
What is eating "gracefully," then?

206
00:13:55,524 --> 00:14:00,202
Anyhow, see what happens
if you fail this test.

207
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,630
Ahh... That's so dirty...

208
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,012
How can you use the same chopstick...

209
00:14:14,172 --> 00:14:17,588
You can't eat fish, can you?

210
00:14:18,137 --> 00:14:21,728
See? You haven't touched it once.

211
00:14:21,848 --> 00:14:24,364
Who said I can't eat this?

212
00:14:24,699 --> 00:14:26,370
I just don't like, that's all.

213
00:14:26,457 --> 00:14:28,306
You're really spoiled.

214
00:14:28,431 --> 00:14:28,999
What?

215
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:32,238
I can't stand people
who only eat what they want.

216
00:14:32,326 --> 00:14:34,296
And you have the guts
to blame my chopsticks...

217
00:14:34,413 --> 00:14:36,967
Hey... Who said I can't eat this?

218
00:14:37,063 --> 00:14:39,260
Then, give it a try.

219
00:14:40,927 --> 00:14:43,382
See? You can't!

220
00:14:43,754 --> 00:14:47,624
How can an adult be fussy about fish?

221
00:14:49,135 --> 00:14:51,149
If you don't like it, then never mind.

222
00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:53,752
Guess we won't get to eat together
all that often, from now on.

223
00:14:53,849 --> 00:14:55,033
I'll do it!

224
00:14:55,129 --> 00:14:57,192
I said I will.

225
00:14:59,821 --> 00:15:00,959
How is it?

226
00:15:01,143 --> 00:15:02,756
Tasty, isn't it?

227
00:15:04,673 --> 00:15:06,460
What's wrong?

228
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,763
Was it a spine?

229
00:15:16,634 --> 00:15:17,669
I'm sorry...

230
00:15:17,777 --> 00:15:20,367
I didn't do that on purpose...

231
00:15:21,733 --> 00:15:26,541
You... Finish this and go study.

232
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:30,370
I'll hit your palm for
every answer you get wrong.

233
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,543
How much is it?

234
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,006
Yes... 6,000 won.

235
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,938
It's almost his birthday?!

236
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:48,059
<i>- Library Card -
Jo Minwoo
ID: 580816 (DoB) - 1634715</i>

237
00:15:48,425 --> 00:15:49,440
What is it?

238
00:15:49,536 --> 00:15:53,187
Ahh... You dropped this.

239
00:16:09,285 --> 00:16:10,927
So you live here?

240
00:16:11,522 --> 00:16:13,199
Yes.

241
00:16:13,992 --> 00:16:16,056
What's your home number?

242
00:16:16,287 --> 00:16:18,177
Why are you asking?

243
00:16:18,286 --> 00:16:21,691
So I can spy on you and see
whether you're studying or not.

244
00:16:22,308 --> 00:16:23,542
Chief.

245
00:16:23,688 --> 00:16:24,772
Why?

246
00:16:24,869 --> 00:16:26,854
Want me to mind my business?

247
00:16:27,014 --> 00:16:29,280
I didn't mean that...

248
00:17:00,807 --> 00:17:01,857
Fell asleep?

249
00:17:01,946 --> 00:17:03,320
Uh?!

250
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:12,799
Doesn't look too safe to
walk around here at night.

251
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:15,676
I'll drive you home every
evening after your studies.

252
00:17:20,774 --> 00:17:22,904
By the way...

253
00:17:23,021 --> 00:17:26,393
What would you like?

254
00:17:27,221 --> 00:17:30,095
Anything you'd like to have,
for instance.

255
00:17:30,272 --> 00:17:32,886
Why, if I want something,
you'll give it to me?

256
00:17:33,003 --> 00:17:33,992
Yes.

257
00:17:34,121 --> 00:17:38,296
If it's anything I can do, I will.

258
00:17:38,523 --> 00:17:40,698
Forget it.

259
00:17:41,961 --> 00:17:43,336
Then again...

260
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,438
How could there be anything
someone like you lacks...

261
00:17:47,569 --> 00:17:51,069
What I mean is just
focus on your studies.

262
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:52,956
Go home now.

263
00:17:53,132 --> 00:17:54,762
Yes.

264
00:18:01,139 --> 00:18:03,246
See you.

265
00:18:10,678 --> 00:18:15,443
Whenever I'm with you,
I can't study anyway...

266
00:18:18,595 --> 00:18:22,793
But why am I blushing,

267
00:18:23,025 --> 00:18:26,483
and my heart beats so fast?

268
00:18:55,721 --> 00:18:56,873
Just leave it here.

269
00:18:56,965 --> 00:18:58,655
But it's headed inside?!

270
00:18:58,801 --> 00:19:01,519
I said just leave it here.

271
00:19:17,143 --> 00:19:23,244
Let's see how long you can
keep starving in there, uh?

272
00:19:27,152 --> 00:19:30,987
That twat is eating
our jjajangmyeon again...

273
00:19:31,132 --> 00:19:32,633
Fat-ass pig...

274
00:19:32,712 --> 00:19:35,117
How many servings did he
stuff himself with, already?!

275
00:19:35,212 --> 00:19:37,288
I'm dying of hunger in here,
I can't let it slide.

276
00:19:37,389 --> 00:19:39,361
What are you going to do?

277
00:19:39,466 --> 00:19:41,686
Wait... Wait! Don't!

278
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:45,087
I can't take it anymore, you fool!
Will you just starve trapped in here?

279
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:47,986
I told you! If he finds out
about Gangmo, we're screwed!

280
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:51,778
Then let's just
order a hundred servings.

281
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:56,456
So the pig can keep stuffing
himself until he croaks.

282
00:19:57,372 --> 00:19:59,304
Why?

283
00:19:59,478 --> 00:20:01,729
I know his appetite quite well,

284
00:20:01,889 --> 00:20:05,850
and if we wait for him to pass out,
we'll first croak of old age.

285
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,591
Aigoo... I'm so hungry...

286
00:20:11,707 --> 00:20:12,942
Hello?

287
00:20:13,116 --> 00:20:14,932
Ohh... Gangmo?

288
00:20:15,238 --> 00:20:15,905
What?

289
00:20:16,065 --> 00:20:17,401
Shideok?

290
00:20:17,518 --> 00:20:20,330
<i>He's eating jjajangmyeon non-stop.</i>

291
00:20:20,461 --> 00:20:22,335
<i>What can we do?</i>

292
00:20:22,744 --> 00:20:26,896
Don't mention me, and just let him be.

293
00:20:27,124 --> 00:20:30,077
When I'm done here,
I'll come back and deal with him.

294
00:20:39,527 --> 00:20:41,227
Here.

295
00:20:42,244 --> 00:20:45,744
<i>It's the newspaper
that recently hired me.</i>

296
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:45,236
<i>{\a6}- Orient Economy Daily -</i>

297
00:20:46,863 --> 00:20:48,955
Go ahead and tell me, Gangmo.

298
00:20:49,169 --> 00:20:51,131
<i>What's my task?</i>

299
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:54,806
There must be a reason
why you asked me to find work...

300
00:20:54,995 --> 00:20:57,435
at a finance newspaper.

301
00:21:03,899 --> 00:21:07,488
It's data on Manbo
Construction's highway project.

302
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:09,602
It should be enough for an article.

303
00:21:09,689 --> 00:21:11,204
Gangmo.

304
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:15,052
Will you promise me just one thing?

305
00:21:16,577 --> 00:21:20,476
That you'll never turn into
a monster like Jo Pilyeon,

306
00:21:20,565 --> 00:21:22,371
just for the sake of success.

307
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:27,949
You're helping me exactly because
you know that'll never happen.

308
00:21:30,215 --> 00:21:32,219
Right...

309
00:21:43,393 --> 00:21:44,715
How did it go?

310
00:21:44,831 --> 00:21:46,693
Have you found his whereabouts?

311
00:21:46,788 --> 00:21:49,698
I think we're approaching
this the wrong way.

312
00:21:50,755 --> 00:21:52,922
Should I just go undercover
in Cheongju by myself?

313
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,482
We have no time for that.

314
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:58,602
We must catch him
before the elections.

315
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,816
So how should we proceed?

316
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:04,405
I need to go somewhere.

317
00:22:11,354 --> 00:22:12,361
What is this?

318
00:22:12,474 --> 00:22:17,542
It's evidence that Jo Pilyeon
broke election law in his dealings.

319
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,732
How many candidates in this
election could be cleared of that?

320
00:22:23,888 --> 00:22:26,976
Bring this up and you'll
only become a laughingstock.

321
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:29,969
But if it turns out that it was Jo Pilyeon
who ordered the assault on those people,

322
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,095
I guess it'd be a little different?

323
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:33,983
Did you catch him?

324
00:22:34,106 --> 00:22:38,844
We can't find any traces
of his whereabouts.

325
00:22:40,544 --> 00:22:42,374
There's no hope.

326
00:22:42,781 --> 00:22:47,210
Unless we catch him and he testifies
about Jo Pilyeon's stratagem,

327
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:50,726
it will be difficult to turn
these elections in our favor.

328
00:22:50,885 --> 00:22:56,798
Among this data is evidence that
Jo bribed the ANSP Chief of Support.

329
00:22:57,379 --> 00:23:00,318
Chief Oh of the ANSP?

330
00:23:01,211 --> 00:23:01,821
And?

331
00:23:01,937 --> 00:23:06,251
To get him, we should make
Jo Pilyeon sway in some way...

332
00:23:06,652 --> 00:23:09,304
Will you help us out with that?

333
00:23:10,057 --> 00:23:10,940
Tell me.

334
00:23:11,046 --> 00:23:13,391
What can I do for you?

335
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:19,050
<i>Come on in.</i>

336
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,534
Sorry for bothering you at this time.

337
00:23:21,932 --> 00:23:23,916
The elections are
right around the corner,

338
00:23:24,047 --> 00:23:26,589
do you have time to spend here?

339
00:23:30,061 --> 00:23:33,288
Evidence of Jo Pilyeon's
activities breaking election law.

340
00:23:36,733 --> 00:23:40,989
You know that he was behind that
assault on those displaced people, right?

341
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,430
What is all this corny nonsense?

342
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:47,643
Think you two can toss all
your dirty laundry to me?

343
00:23:47,909 --> 00:23:54,022
According to this data, turns out
Jo Pilyeon tossed you a little money?!

344
00:23:54,177 --> 00:23:55,726
What?!

345
00:23:55,920 --> 00:24:00,796
I hope you're not involved
with that assault in any way?

346
00:24:01,033 --> 00:24:03,078
Listen, Min Honggi!

347
00:24:05,951 --> 00:24:08,252
<i>Who is this man?</i>

348
00:24:08,595 --> 00:24:13,403
He's a gang boss with
seven prior convictions.

349
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:22,699
Seems like you might be
taking us lightly,

350
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:26,408
but I can throw you in the can for
breaking election law right away!

351
00:24:26,524 --> 00:24:30,039
You know your director and
I are very close, don't you?

352
00:24:30,606 --> 00:24:34,136
Shall we give it a go and
see whose head rolls first?

353
00:24:34,252 --> 00:24:37,775
Think such pathetic threats
will work with me?

354
00:24:40,913 --> 00:24:43,374
Aigoo... So you were here.

355
00:24:44,167 --> 00:24:45,819
Long time no see, Chief Oh.

356
00:24:45,928 --> 00:24:49,542
And what brings you here, Congressman?

357
00:24:49,847 --> 00:24:55,162
<i>I was next door, having a
drink with the ANSP director.</i>

358
00:24:56,731 --> 00:24:58,387
Listen, Candidate Min.

359
00:24:58,579 --> 00:25:01,612
<i>When you're done here,
come let me know.</i>

360
00:25:05,606 --> 00:25:12,020
I've heard rumors a senior ANSP executive
was helping an opposition candidate...

361
00:25:12,528 --> 00:25:15,129
I hope it won't turn out to be you.

362
00:25:19,675 --> 00:25:21,564
Sit.

363
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,674
Here...

364
00:25:30,972 --> 00:25:35,795
Whether I'll go next door
only depends on you.

365
00:25:36,056 --> 00:25:40,051
Actually, what I was about
to ask you is very simple.

366
00:25:40,617 --> 00:25:43,984
That clearance squad boss
who helped Jo Pilyeon.

367
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:47,136
That Choi Taewook...

368
00:25:47,543 --> 00:25:50,779
All you need to do is order his arrest.

369
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:52,822
Is it just that?

370
00:25:52,917 --> 00:25:54,777
You have my word.

371
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,072
Nothing else.

372
00:25:59,503 --> 00:26:01,623
Here, have a drink.

373
00:26:06,002 --> 00:26:13,072
So you can derail Jo Pilyeon's
campaign and help Candidate Min win?

374
00:26:13,251 --> 00:26:15,196
Just wait and see.

375
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,238
That's right!

376
00:26:17,579 --> 00:26:22,681
The ANSP needs to be filled
with people like you, indeed.

377
00:26:24,101 --> 00:26:25,757
I'll get going, Sir.

378
00:26:25,902 --> 00:26:27,845
Why, already leaving?

379
00:26:28,067 --> 00:26:30,065
Min Honggi should be here any moment?!

380
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:32,303
I'll leave you two alone tonight.

381
00:26:32,588 --> 00:26:34,833
I will visit you again soon.

382
00:26:34,943 --> 00:26:37,185
<i>All right.</i>

383
00:26:59,682 --> 00:27:02,516
<i>- Hong Gipyo -</i>

384
00:27:40,767 --> 00:27:44,675
It's been quite a long time
since Chairman Hong passed away.

385
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,956
Was it you?

386
00:27:47,212 --> 00:27:50,558
The one who asked me to meet here?

387
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:00,371
After Hwang Taeseop gained control
of the construction committee,

388
00:28:00,609 --> 00:28:04,831
it indeed seems that all the biggest
projects went to Manbo Construction.

389
00:28:05,092 --> 00:28:09,593
When Chairman Hong was leading
the committee, those were the days.

390
00:28:09,862 --> 00:28:13,160
It was our golden age.

391
00:28:13,755 --> 00:28:18,883
Can't you turn back the page
and return to the committee of old?

392
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:21,396
Trying to contend with Chairman Hwang...

393
00:28:21,483 --> 00:28:23,580
is beyond my abilities.

394
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:28,243
Will you join forces with me, then?

395
00:28:29,376 --> 00:28:35,666
I will not share my new method
with any other committee member.

396
00:28:36,494 --> 00:28:40,301
So you will sign an
exclusive deal with us?

397
00:28:40,517 --> 00:28:43,698
Not a deal, but a partnership.

398
00:28:44,744 --> 00:28:48,041
It will be the perfect opportunity
to surpass Manbo Construction.

399
00:28:48,228 --> 00:28:50,699
But the more I look at you,

400
00:28:51,949 --> 00:28:55,028
you really seem familiar.

401
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:03,527
Right...

402
00:29:03,818 --> 00:29:05,692
I remember now.

403
00:29:06,095 --> 00:29:09,483
You worked under Chairman Hwang...

404
00:29:13,434 --> 00:29:19,471
That Lee Gangmo who killed
Hong Gipyo and did time in prison.

405
00:29:19,562 --> 00:29:21,511
I wasn't the one
who killed Chairman Hong.

406
00:29:21,641 --> 00:29:22,547
What?

407
00:29:22,649 --> 00:29:25,839
Other people are responsible,
and deserve to pay for it.

408
00:29:26,057 --> 00:29:27,251
What are you trying to say?

409
00:29:27,345 --> 00:29:29,455
Chairman Hwang Taeseop's son,

410
00:29:29,727 --> 00:29:33,140
Hwang Jeongshik, is the one
who killed Chairman Hong.

411
00:29:33,474 --> 00:29:36,844
And of course Chairman Hwang
covered up the truth.

412
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:40,520
Is that really the truth?

413
00:29:40,621 --> 00:29:46,752
Were I the real culprit,
I would have never met you this way.

414
00:29:48,611 --> 00:29:55,598
It's natural you'd bear a grudge
against Manbo Construction.

415
00:30:00,203 --> 00:30:01,702
- Ohh... Come on in.
- Seongmo is here.

416
00:30:01,789 --> 00:30:04,105
- Seongo, you're here?
- Bring us some tea.

417
00:30:04,239 --> 00:30:06,525
Sure. Wait a moment.

418
00:30:06,661 --> 00:30:08,776
Here... Sit.

419
00:30:12,335 --> 00:30:14,921
So, what brings you here so early?

420
00:30:15,095 --> 00:30:17,112
Have you heard the news?

421
00:30:17,347 --> 00:30:18,393
What news?

422
00:30:18,498 --> 00:30:24,415
The ANSP ordered an investigation
into the clearance area assault.

423
00:30:25,723 --> 00:30:28,952
So who was behind the order?

424
00:30:29,081 --> 00:30:35,179
I think Min Honggi might have
gotten the ANSP top brass involved.

425
00:30:35,773 --> 00:30:39,579
So he plans to continue with
his usual tricks until the very end.

426
00:30:39,841 --> 00:30:42,993
The ANSP is currently after that
clearance squad leader, Choi Taewook.

427
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:45,201
If they ever get
the chance to catch him...

428
00:30:45,346 --> 00:30:49,038
Even the police is on his trail,
but still no clues whatsoever.

429
00:30:49,155 --> 00:30:50,600
I don't think you need to worry.

430
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:55,423
According to our intelligence,
he seemed to be hiding in Cheongju?

431
00:30:57,151 --> 00:30:59,852
If he stays in one place for
too long, it'll be dangerous.

432
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,786
I'll keep reporting any development,

433
00:31:02,904 --> 00:31:05,519
so watch his back carefully.

434
00:31:06,158 --> 00:31:06,819
All right.

435
00:31:06,935 --> 00:31:08,663
Thanks.

436
00:31:09,128 --> 00:31:11,048
I'll get going.

437
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:20,764
I think it would be wise
to move him somewhere else.

438
00:31:21,031 --> 00:31:22,546
Since we're there,

439
00:31:22,641 --> 00:31:24,058
just send him back to Seoul.

440
00:31:24,139 --> 00:31:25,244
What?

441
00:31:25,352 --> 00:31:27,611
Place him where we can see him.

442
00:31:27,757 --> 00:31:32,463
So if worst comes to worst,
we can always get rid of him.

443
00:31:33,218 --> 00:31:34,436
All right.

444
00:32:08,597 --> 00:32:10,212
It's him.

445
00:32:11,239 --> 00:32:13,084
What is it?

446
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:18,909
Take this and come back to Seoul.

447
00:32:19,113 --> 00:32:20,724
Yes, all right.

448
00:32:20,841 --> 00:32:23,608
- Watch your back.
- Yes.

449
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:42,964
<i>Who are you people?</i>

450
00:32:43,057 --> 00:32:43,938
Let me go!

451
00:32:44,058 --> 00:32:45,506
Let go!

452
00:32:46,626 --> 00:32:48,111
Follow us quietly.

453
00:32:50,272 --> 00:32:54,281
You're making a big mistake.

454
00:32:54,412 --> 00:32:56,053
Really?!

455
00:33:24,062 --> 00:33:25,863
Hello?

456
00:33:26,066 --> 00:33:28,725
<i>Could you pass me to the chairman?</i>

457
00:33:28,987 --> 00:33:31,267
What kind of fool
is calling at this hour?

458
00:33:31,369 --> 00:33:32,751
Aigoo... Beats me.

459
00:33:32,839 --> 00:33:34,131
Take it, quick.

460
00:33:34,219 --> 00:33:36,645
Ehh... Really...

461
00:33:37,952 --> 00:33:39,884
Hello?

462
00:33:43,835 --> 00:33:47,564
Commissioner Han Myeongseok
joined forces with Chairman Cheon,

463
00:33:47,657 --> 00:33:50,837
and they're planning to
bring you down together.

464
00:33:51,099 --> 00:33:52,929
Wh...What?!

465
00:33:53,379 --> 00:33:55,399
Who are you?

466
00:33:55,878 --> 00:33:59,132
Who are you, to make
this kind of call at...

467
00:34:00,367 --> 00:34:02,196
Who the hell is it?

468
00:34:02,291 --> 00:34:03,940
Hello?

469
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:06,741
Ohh Ohh... Really...

470
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:42,120
<i>What on earth are you people doing?</i>

471
00:34:41,888 --> 00:34:44,996
<i>{\a6}- Manbo Construction's Highway
Project Goes 30 Percent Over Budget -</i>

472
00:34:42,512 --> 00:34:47,103
<i>What were you doing while
this article was published?</i>

473
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:50,240
Someone might have tried to
harm us through this article.

474
00:34:50,415 --> 00:34:51,941
What are you trying to say?

475
00:34:52,038 --> 00:34:55,700
That they made them publish
this article on purpose?

476
00:34:55,905 --> 00:34:59,209
We haven't completed
even half of the construction.

477
00:34:59,304 --> 00:35:03,704
Unless someone was trying to
manipulate public opinion...

478
00:35:03,923 --> 00:35:06,756
And who would be trying to do that?

479
00:35:07,192 --> 00:35:10,395
I'll deal with the press, Dad.

480
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:19,104
Also, why is Hangang Construction
refusing to share their new method with us?

481
00:35:19,278 --> 00:35:21,370
Isn't that obvious?

482
00:35:21,515 --> 00:35:26,307
They're trying to gain more leverage to
then ask for more favorable conditions later.

483
00:35:26,386 --> 00:35:29,836
I'll take my boys and deal
with them once and for...

484
00:35:29,908 --> 00:35:33,608
<i>Jeongyeon, you go meet them firsthand.</i>

485
00:35:33,701 --> 00:35:37,433
Whatever their conditions,
you must get that contract signed.

486
00:35:37,578 --> 00:35:39,539
Yes, Chairman.

487
00:35:44,987 --> 00:35:49,098
The City Council just
requested a meeting with you.

488
00:35:49,883 --> 00:35:51,916
Commissioner Han?

489
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:56,231
Guess it's about additional
budget resources.

490
00:35:56,419 --> 00:35:57,963
It's not that.

491
00:35:58,056 --> 00:36:00,051
I think they read that article.

492
00:36:00,204 --> 00:36:01,314
So?

493
00:36:01,526 --> 00:36:03,700
Are you telling me they're
refusing to increase our budget?

494
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:06,135
We'll have to go and find out.

495
00:36:06,828 --> 00:36:10,619
I have an appointment
in the afternoon,

496
00:36:11,142 --> 00:36:14,760
so Jeongyeon and Chief Jo
will have to go on my behalf.

497
00:36:14,933 --> 00:36:16,510
All right.

498
00:36:28,203 --> 00:36:31,185
You leave as well.

499
00:36:42,922 --> 00:36:44,617
Director Ju.

500
00:36:44,722 --> 00:36:49,295
Dig into what's going on
between Commissioner Han...

501
00:36:49,421 --> 00:36:53,584
and Chairman Cheon Suman
of Gwangmyeong Construction.

502
00:36:53,692 --> 00:36:55,827
Why are you suddenly asking that?

503
00:36:56,008 --> 00:37:00,526
I got this really
upsetting call last night.

504
00:37:00,845 --> 00:37:04,877
It suggested that Commissioner Han joined
forces with Gwangmyeong Construction,

505
00:37:05,153 --> 00:37:09,205
and that they're trying to
bring Manbo Construction down.

506
00:37:09,417 --> 00:37:12,428
You know that Commissioner Han
wouldn't be capable of that.

507
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,713
I do believe so myself,

508
00:37:15,873 --> 00:37:21,423
but who was behind that call...

509
00:37:30,182 --> 00:37:32,289
Wait!

510
00:38:34,576 --> 00:38:39,666
The situation is urgent, so I was
hoping the chairman would come?

511
00:38:39,771 --> 00:38:41,034
I apologize.

512
00:38:41,132 --> 00:38:43,550
Something urgent came up.

513
00:38:43,842 --> 00:38:46,979
If that's the case,
then I'll get straight to the point.

514
00:38:47,259 --> 00:38:53,341
Because the company's situation was
exposed by the press in this manner,

515
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:57,180
we will no longer be able to increase
your budget for the highway construction.

516
00:38:57,485 --> 00:38:59,272
Commissioner.

517
00:38:59,539 --> 00:39:04,923
You know about Hangang Construction's
new construction method, right?

518
00:39:05,184 --> 00:39:07,216
If they share their technology,

519
00:39:07,465 --> 00:39:10,370
then I think the problem
would be solved pretty quickly?!

520
00:39:10,937 --> 00:39:13,708
We are trying to
approach them ourselves,

521
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:18,042
but for whatever reason,
they refuse to do business with us.

522
00:39:19,581 --> 00:39:22,995
Whatever the case, try to convince them.

523
00:39:23,184 --> 00:39:29,154
We're barely stopping the Department of
Public Works' calls for on-site supervision.

524
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:31,425
All right.

525
00:39:36,175 --> 00:39:39,516
Didn't you say you'd take care
of contacting Hangang Construction?

526
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:43,322
Their president is currently
abroad on a business trip.

527
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:49,876
Have you even looked into what
kind of person we're dealing with?

528
00:39:50,326 --> 00:39:54,887
We couldn't dig any background
info on him whatsoever.

529
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:56,843
I'll give it a try, then.

530
00:39:56,933 --> 00:39:59,554
I already sent someone
to Hangang Construction,

531
00:39:59,694 --> 00:40:02,016
so we will soon get something.

532
00:40:13,135 --> 00:40:15,892
Did I make you wait?

533
00:40:16,077 --> 00:40:17,920
There was a little traffic on the way.

534
00:40:18,016 --> 00:40:20,044
- Let's go in.
- Right.

535
00:40:26,712 --> 00:40:28,172
And who is this gentleman?

536
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:29,632
Let me introduce him.

537
00:40:29,791 --> 00:40:32,087
He's James Lee, an expat.

538
00:40:32,246 --> 00:40:33,888
He's the president of
Hangang Construction.

539
00:40:34,004 --> 00:40:35,916
Hangang Construction?

540
00:40:36,453 --> 00:40:40,229
Ahh... The ones who developed
that new construction method?

541
00:40:40,389 --> 00:40:42,173
I apologize, I should have
introduced myself earlier.

542
00:40:42,258 --> 00:40:43,411
<i>Ahh... Don't say that.</i>

543
00:40:43,527 --> 00:40:45,256
I was looking forward
to meeting you myself.

544
00:40:45,488 --> 00:40:48,336
We just signed a cooperation deal.

545
00:40:48,452 --> 00:40:50,645
Ahh... You did?

546
00:40:50,762 --> 00:40:52,984
Here... Let's have a seat.

547
00:40:56,717 --> 00:40:59,979
I must thank you for
the estimates you sent me.

548
00:41:00,088 --> 00:41:03,002
It's really a remarkable project,
particularly considering the reduced costs.

549
00:41:03,111 --> 00:41:09,486
Then, can you hand over Manbo
Construction's highway project to us?

550
00:41:09,791 --> 00:41:13,233
Well... If I may be blunt
and get right to the point...

551
00:41:13,341 --> 00:41:15,456
I'm afraid that would be
ethically problematic.

552
00:41:15,674 --> 00:41:18,042
Is that so?

553
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:21,484
Right... Chairman Cheon.

554
00:41:21,615 --> 00:41:24,065
I'd like a word in private
with him, if I may.

555
00:41:24,181 --> 00:41:25,590
What?

556
00:41:27,464 --> 00:41:28,499
Sure.

557
00:41:28,598 --> 00:41:30,282
Then...

558
00:41:35,192 --> 00:41:41,923
As commissioner, there is
a favor I'd like to ask you.

559
00:41:42,286 --> 00:41:43,985
Go ahead and tell me.

560
00:41:44,886 --> 00:41:47,530
Help out Manbo Construction.

561
00:41:49,781 --> 00:41:52,745
May I ask you just one thing?

562
00:41:54,430 --> 00:42:00,450
I'm curious about the reason you
support Manbo Construction so much.

563
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:04,296
There is no particular reason.

564
00:42:04,457 --> 00:42:08,189
I'm merely fulfilling my duties as
commissioner of the City Council.

565
00:42:08,408 --> 00:42:13,823
If that is truly the reason, then I'd
prefer if you didn't help them at all.

566
00:42:14,012 --> 00:42:16,510
What are you implying with that?

567
00:42:16,707 --> 00:42:20,796
A close acquaintance of mine
works under Candidate Jo Pilyeon.

568
00:42:20,970 --> 00:42:25,284
But according to him, should
Candidate Jo win the elections,

569
00:42:25,411 --> 00:42:29,718
he plans to remove anyone involved
with Min Honggi from their positions.

570
00:42:30,009 --> 00:42:34,657
I heard your name
was on that list as well.

571
00:42:37,827 --> 00:42:43,489
Isn't Chairman Hwang Taeseop
Candidate Jo's most faithful supporter?

572
00:42:47,936 --> 00:42:53,747
I... believe we should always
separate politics and business.

573
00:42:54,175 --> 00:42:56,859
I'm surprised to hear that?

574
00:42:57,132 --> 00:43:01,015
I always thought politics
and money go hand in hand?!

575
00:43:03,761 --> 00:43:05,678
President Lee, what I was saying...

576
00:43:05,794 --> 00:43:10,340
If you're asking me to join
forces with Manbo Construction,

577
00:43:10,432 --> 00:43:12,651
I might be inclined to do so.

578
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:16,755
But I leave the decision
to you, so let me know.

579
00:43:16,873 --> 00:43:19,045
Excuse me.

580
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:53,284
<i>{\a6}- The 3rd Han River Bridge by Hyeeun -</i>

581
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:53,284
The river flows under the
3rd Han River bridge.

582
00:43:53,531 --> 00:43:57,439
Carrying along your dreams and mine,

583
00:43:57,569 --> 00:44:01,848
And our hearts along with them.

584
00:44:02,392 --> 00:44:04,609
That's not how it ends.

585
00:44:04,703 --> 00:44:06,574
That's how you do it, hands up.

586
00:44:06,653 --> 00:44:08,652
No, higher.

587
00:44:12,129 --> 00:44:13,584
Hello?

588
00:44:13,771 --> 00:44:15,296
<i>It's me.</i>

589
00:44:16,313 --> 00:44:19,407
Why... did you call?

590
00:44:19,683 --> 00:44:21,049
Why?!

591
00:44:22,931 --> 00:44:26,388
Told you I'd check on you
out of the blue.

592
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:31,807
<i>If you're just going to scold me,
you don't need to bother.</i>

593
00:44:34,726 --> 00:44:36,665
What were you doing?

594
00:44:36,759 --> 00:44:40,017
I... was studying, why?

595
00:44:40,191 --> 00:44:41,614
<i>Don't lie to me.</i>

596
00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:44,535
<i>Why would studying
make you gasp for air?</i>

597
00:44:44,985 --> 00:44:49,648
After studying, I only
practiced singing a lil' bit.

598
00:44:50,287 --> 00:44:52,684
Already forgot when your test is?

599
00:44:52,844 --> 00:44:54,820
Even if I didn't want to call you,

600
00:44:54,922 --> 00:44:57,522
you'd force me anyway,
by acting like this.

601
00:44:57,914 --> 00:45:00,817
I'll be calling again in an hour,
so start studying.

602
00:45:00,910 --> 00:45:02,693
Are we clear?

603
00:45:03,696 --> 00:45:05,356
<i>Yes...</i>

604
00:45:12,204 --> 00:45:14,281
Minwoo.

605
00:45:15,574 --> 00:45:19,133
Take a look at this young lady.

606
00:45:19,642 --> 00:45:21,051
Who's this?

607
00:45:21,306 --> 00:45:25,278
She's the daughter of Hwaseong Electric's
chairman, and the matchmaker set up a meeting.

608
00:45:26,135 --> 00:45:27,449
Do you want me to go
to a marriage meeting?

609
00:45:27,537 --> 00:45:28,831
Yeah.

610
00:45:29,243 --> 00:45:33,342
She's a hundred times better than
Jeongyeon in any possible way.

611
00:45:33,625 --> 00:45:39,842
And this has only happened because your
father is likely to win the elections.

612
00:45:40,234 --> 00:45:41,687
Forget it.

613
00:45:42,007 --> 00:45:44,124
Forget what?

614
00:45:44,244 --> 00:45:47,443
They're orders from your father,
so you must meet her. Got it?

615
00:45:47,522 --> 00:45:49,160
Here.

616
00:46:01,935 --> 00:46:03,512
<i>Hey.</i>

617
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,476
Just because your precious
Chief told you to study,

618
00:46:06,621 --> 00:46:11,051
you stick your nose up those books
all day without blinking once?

619
00:46:11,676 --> 00:46:12,736
Of course.

620
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:16,949
He's even tutoring me,
so I should listen.

621
00:46:18,561 --> 00:46:21,393
Chief Jo is even tutoring you?!

622
00:46:21,484 --> 00:46:22,468
Yeah.

623
00:46:22,564 --> 00:46:24,907
When did it start between you two?

624
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:25,708
Uh?!

625
00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:29,484
When did he confess that he likes you.

626
00:46:29,594 --> 00:46:31,472
It's not what you think.

627
00:46:31,646 --> 00:46:33,900
And Chief Jo doesn't like me.

628
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:37,515
How can you be so silly?

629
00:46:37,645 --> 00:46:39,064
With that temper of his,

630
00:46:39,188 --> 00:46:42,860
think he'd tutor you and drive
you home, unless he liked you?

631
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:44,865
That's just...

632
00:46:46,012 --> 00:46:47,072
How about you?

633
00:46:47,172 --> 00:46:47,900
About what?

634
00:46:48,001 --> 00:46:51,241
Whether you like Chief Jo.

635
00:46:52,955 --> 00:46:54,218
You do!

636
00:46:54,349 --> 00:46:55,700
Right?

637
00:46:55,874 --> 00:46:58,322
I knew it!

638
00:46:58,413 --> 00:46:59,619
Then again...

639
00:46:59,748 --> 00:47:02,379
If you didn't like that kind
of man, you'd be insane.

640
00:47:02,485 --> 00:47:06,575
Just believe me, I can
assure you Chief Jo likes you.

641
00:47:06,686 --> 00:47:09,061
So be the first to confess to him.

642
00:47:09,251 --> 00:47:10,490
Me?!

643
00:47:10,582 --> 00:47:12,533
Ehh... No way.

644
00:47:12,642 --> 00:47:16,634
If you lose that kind of catch,
you'll regret it your entire life!

645
00:47:16,743 --> 00:47:19,417
If you can't say it with words,
go with a present.

646
00:47:19,608 --> 00:47:21,724
A meaningful one, at that.

647
00:47:23,124 --> 00:47:24,794
Is there such a thing?

648
00:47:24,939 --> 00:47:27,975
I worked part-time
at a department store.

649
00:47:28,121 --> 00:47:32,362
I heard this there,
and it seems like necktie pins...

650
00:47:32,477 --> 00:47:36,503
are what women give to men
when they're about to confess?!

651
00:48:02,485 --> 00:48:04,390
Pretty...

652
00:48:12,797 --> 00:48:15,843
<i>- To Chief Jo Minwoo -
Happy Birthday</i>

653
00:48:47,346 --> 00:48:50,049
Let's have some coffee.

654
00:48:50,174 --> 00:48:51,602
A marriage meeting?!

655
00:48:51,733 --> 00:48:54,375
So, what, you're going?

656
00:48:55,176 --> 00:48:58,643
Then again, if it's Hwaseong
Electric, no reason to refuse?

657
00:48:58,767 --> 00:49:01,268
Wow... Jo Minwoo!

658
00:49:01,384 --> 00:49:04,917
So you're soon becoming
in-laws with tycoons?!

659
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:13,635
But weren't you dating that
country chick, these days?

660
00:49:15,049 --> 00:49:17,329
Who said I was dating her?

661
00:49:17,852 --> 00:49:19,799
I'm just helping her out of compassion.

662
00:49:19,958 --> 00:49:21,219
<i>Really?</i>

663
00:49:22,747 --> 00:49:25,319
So leave her to me, will you?

664
00:49:25,435 --> 00:49:29,728
I'll wipe that country feel out
of her, and turn her into a looker.

665
00:49:31,602 --> 00:49:33,258
Do whatever you want.

666
00:49:33,555 --> 00:49:34,565
Really?

667
00:49:34,652 --> 00:49:36,145
So we're clear on that?

668
00:49:36,308 --> 00:49:39,242
I can have her, right?

669
00:49:39,548 --> 00:49:41,610
Hey, Hwang Jeongshik.

670
00:49:42,137 --> 00:49:45,995
Why do you keep
treating her like some obj...

671
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:53,185
<i>What's wrong with you?</i>

672
00:49:56,890 --> 00:50:00,100
<i>What... Was country chick here?</i>

673
00:50:01,521 --> 00:50:04,048
Ehh... You really!

674
00:50:28,772 --> 00:50:34,211
Yes. If it's anything
I can do, I will.

675
00:50:36,588 --> 00:50:38,650
Jo Minwoo...

676
00:50:38,912 --> 00:50:41,686
You must be really crazy.

677
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:35,553
You bastard.

678
00:51:36,032 --> 00:51:38,291
No need to show everyone
you're better than them.

679
00:51:38,393 --> 00:51:41,081
Why is he looking down
on people that way?

680
00:51:43,230 --> 00:51:46,876
Did I ever ask him to help me?

681
00:51:47,105 --> 00:51:52,033
He can't even eat fish,
and acts all fussy with food.

682
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:18,009
Jo Minwoo!

683
00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:01,362
Get out of the way.

684
00:53:01,565 --> 00:53:05,051
- Hey... Miju.
- I said out of the way!

685
00:53:07,361 --> 00:53:12,169
I know...
I shouldn't have said that.

686
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:14,551
I'm sorry.

687
00:53:16,614 --> 00:53:18,176
Happy now?

688
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:21,560
Shouldn't have said what?

689
00:53:23,449 --> 00:53:25,439
What I meant...

690
00:53:27,051 --> 00:53:29,911
Just, all of it.

691
00:53:31,874 --> 00:53:34,575
If my parents had been alive,

692
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:37,402
I'd be the most precious
daughter in the world to them?!

693
00:53:37,822 --> 00:53:39,334
Hey...

694
00:53:41,585 --> 00:53:44,258
Need to cry for that?

695
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:47,396
I know how great you are,

696
00:53:47,555 --> 00:53:52,290
but you still shouldn't
treat people like objects.

697
00:53:55,021 --> 00:53:56,546
I apologize.

698
00:53:56,836 --> 00:54:01,703
But I never treated you like an object.

699
00:54:03,969 --> 00:54:07,070
While talking with Jeongshik,
it just came out like that.

700
00:54:07,757 --> 00:54:13,041
Also, if I'd ever considered you an object,
would I come here to apologize?

701
00:54:14,857 --> 00:54:20,161
Thank you for everything
you've done for me all this time.

702
00:54:20,632 --> 00:54:24,004
Why are you suddenly thanking me?

703
00:54:24,730 --> 00:54:29,219
Just thought I should at least
bid you farewell one last time.

704
00:54:30,366 --> 00:54:32,429
Last?

705
00:54:34,986 --> 00:54:37,600
So you're not going to see me again?

706
00:54:39,792 --> 00:54:45,123
I don't want any more
of your compassion.

707
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:46,748
I looked into it.

708
00:55:46,948 --> 00:55:48,188
Who is it?

709
00:55:48,387 --> 00:55:51,993
Who is scheming behind our backs to
get his hands on our highway project?

710
00:55:52,163 --> 00:55:54,471
It's Chairman Cheon Suman
of Gwangmyeong Construction.

711
00:55:54,596 --> 00:55:57,014
What... Chairman Cheon?!

712
00:55:57,204 --> 00:56:03,677
The City Council informed us he signed an
exclusive deal with Hangang Construction.

713
00:56:03,837 --> 00:56:08,589
So it was Chairman Cheon who
put pressure on the commissioner?

714
00:56:08,701 --> 00:56:12,204
This doesn't feel right...

715
00:56:12,411 --> 00:56:18,983
Chairman Cheon wouldn't have the
guts to scheme something like this?!

716
00:56:21,830 --> 00:56:24,096
Listen, Chairman Cheon!

717
00:56:24,282 --> 00:56:27,888
Can fellow committee members
do this to each other?

718
00:56:28,027 --> 00:56:30,523
I'm well aware of your position.

719
00:56:30,691 --> 00:56:33,362
But I did nothing wrong.

720
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:35,031
You didn't?!

721
00:56:35,142 --> 00:56:39,851
Throwing your spoon on someone else's
table is doing nothing wrong?

722
00:56:39,976 --> 00:56:45,630
Commissioner Han asked me for
estimates and I gave them to him,

723
00:56:45,811 --> 00:56:49,267
and since Hangang Construction
proposed an exclusive deal, I signed it.

724
00:56:49,456 --> 00:56:50,382
What?

725
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:55,001
Then, are you telling me it was
Commissioner Han who introduced them to you?

726
00:56:55,092 --> 00:56:58,636
It's not like I was trying to create
a rift between fellow committee members,

727
00:56:58,856 --> 00:57:03,793
<i>but I certainly couldn't resist
the commissioner's decision.</i>

728
00:57:03,985 --> 00:57:06,008
<i>I was put in an awkward position myself.</i>

729
00:57:06,138 --> 00:57:08,431
<i>Why would the commissioner...</i>

730
00:57:08,542 --> 00:57:13,692
Seems that he didn't like the idea that
the committee was supporting Candidate Jo.

731
00:57:13,837 --> 00:57:19,227
He even offered me the possibility
of leading the committee.

732
00:57:19,372 --> 00:57:21,771
Han Myeongseok...

733
00:57:21,872 --> 00:57:24,545
You bastard!

734
00:57:48,163 --> 00:57:52,652
Right as planned, Hwang Taeseop
started suspecting Commissioner Han.

735
00:57:52,812 --> 00:57:55,746
I don't know how the
situation will develop,

736
00:57:56,049 --> 00:57:59,508
but I'm counting on you.

737
00:58:04,752 --> 00:58:07,251
We can't just blindly trust
everything he says, Dad.

738
00:58:07,352 --> 00:58:12,718
I received a call the other night, suggesting
that Commissioner Han would betray me.

739
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:14,665
Who called you?

740
00:58:14,839 --> 00:58:18,049
I can't figure out who that could be.

741
00:58:18,238 --> 00:58:21,161
Whether he was a friend or foe.

742
00:58:21,286 --> 00:58:26,632
If Commissioner Han truly
abandoned us, then what?

743
00:58:26,937 --> 00:58:31,223
Once Jo Pilyeon wins the
elections, it's game over.

744
00:58:31,701 --> 00:58:37,991
Because Han Myeongseok will be the
first head to roll for betraying me.

745
00:58:38,367 --> 00:58:40,359
Ahh... Also.

746
00:58:41,042 --> 00:58:46,168
So Hangang Construction's
president is currently overseas?

747
00:58:46,821 --> 00:58:48,009
Yes.

748
00:58:48,149 --> 00:58:50,206
There's no time to waste,

749
00:58:50,351 --> 00:58:58,164
so at least go meet with the other
employees there and win them over.

750
00:59:19,817 --> 00:59:21,971
What's this, some nursing home?

751
00:59:22,048 --> 00:59:24,901
Coming here to stuff himself
all day and then doze off.

752
00:59:25,018 --> 00:59:28,433
Aigoo... What else is new...

753
00:59:28,850 --> 00:59:29,891
- Gangmo.
- Hey.

754
00:59:29,963 --> 00:59:32,018
So, what, did it go well in Seoul?

755
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:33,966
Yes.

756
00:59:34,452 --> 00:59:36,587
<i>Hey... Wake up.</i>

757
00:59:36,712 --> 00:59:38,490
I said wake up, you useless fool.

758
00:59:38,635 --> 00:59:41,003
Ehh... Really.

759
00:59:55,702 --> 00:59:57,765
G...Gangmo...

760
01:00:00,975 --> 01:00:04,840
I... I'm not dreaming, right?

761
01:00:04,941 --> 01:00:08,108
A pinch and you'll know, you fool.

762
01:00:15,008 --> 01:00:16,992
How have you been?

763
01:00:24,042 --> 01:00:27,505
You... You were alive?

764
01:00:28,319 --> 01:00:30,367
I missed you, Shideok.

765
01:00:30,527 --> 01:00:32,249
Gangmo...

766
01:00:32,373 --> 01:00:34,013
Gangmo!

767
01:00:34,144 --> 01:00:36,476
Gangmo!

768
01:00:39,743 --> 01:00:41,546
Gangmo...

769
01:00:41,639 --> 01:00:43,491
Gangmo...

770
01:00:59,531 --> 01:01:01,376
Gangmo!

771
01:01:12,628 --> 01:01:15,669
<i>{\a6}- Cheonan, South Chungcheong -</i>

772
01:01:12,628 --> 01:01:15,669
<i>Munhwa-Dong, Dongnam-Gu
San 727 - 2nd Street</i>

773
01:01:35,805 --> 01:01:37,792
You're here, Chief?

774
01:01:38,463 --> 01:01:41,725
Have you looked into
Hangang Construction?

775
01:01:41,870 --> 01:01:47,361
Yes, their president is a certain
James Lee, an expat from the US.

776
01:01:48,712 --> 01:01:50,521
James Lee?!

777
01:01:50,635 --> 01:01:55,539
<i>Those mudflats Lee Gangmo owned
are under James Lee's name.</i>

778
01:01:55,873 --> 01:01:57,557
What's the matter?

779
01:01:57,650 --> 01:02:00,663
I'll have to head to Hangang
Construction's offices right away.

780
01:02:00,954 --> 01:02:02,363
Get my car.

781
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:04,467
<i>Yes, Chief.</i>

782
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:10,512
I know you bear a grudge against
Jeongshik and the chairman,

783
01:02:11,082 --> 01:02:15,247
but shouldn't you at least
tell Jeongyeon that you're alive?

784
01:02:15,341 --> 01:02:16,901
Don't tell her.

785
01:02:16,997 --> 01:02:18,694
You must not let her know.

786
01:02:18,788 --> 01:02:22,708
Are you really plotting to
bring Manbo Construction down?

787
01:02:23,274 --> 01:02:25,528
Manbo Construction's heir is Jeongyeon.

788
01:02:25,622 --> 01:02:28,475
That can only mean you'll
have to fight with Jeongyeon.

789
01:02:28,663 --> 01:02:32,704
If that's where things go,
I guess I'll have to.

790
01:02:32,813 --> 01:02:35,065
Listen to you... Lee Gangmo!

791
01:02:37,185 --> 01:02:39,786
Do you know why Jeongyeon
has been living that way?

792
01:02:40,018 --> 01:02:42,423
It was only to avenge you!

793
01:02:42,662 --> 01:02:46,536
To make Minwoo and Jeongshik
pay for what they did to you.

794
01:02:47,219 --> 01:02:51,562
She even caught aphasia,
shocked about your death.

795
01:02:52,828 --> 01:02:57,329
Seeing her struggle so much by
herself on that construction site...

796
01:02:57,634 --> 01:03:00,772
It's so hard to bear, it brings me tears.

797
01:03:01,164 --> 01:03:02,794
<i>Gangmo...</i>

798
01:03:03,004 --> 01:03:05,728
<i>You loved Jeongyeon.</i>

799
01:03:06,193 --> 01:03:09,536
You still love her!

800
01:03:11,132 --> 01:03:15,083
Stop talking about Jeongyeon,
I don't want to hear it.

801
01:03:18,352 --> 01:03:20,454
Shideok.

802
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:23,243
You'll help me out, right?

803
01:03:34,379 --> 01:03:38,115
What drunken sack of cow shit
taught you how to drive?

804
01:03:38,213 --> 01:03:40,625
You fool! Where do you think
you are, driving like that?

805
01:03:40,698 --> 01:03:43,211
<i>Know how much this cost?</i>

806
01:03:47,816 --> 01:03:49,556
You...

807
01:04:05,491 --> 01:04:08,847
<i>What's with all the cars today?</i>

808
01:04:12,783 --> 01:04:14,483
Gangmo!

809
01:04:14,919 --> 01:04:17,054
Jeongyeon is here!

We came to the conclusion that you're no
longer able to complete the construction.

816
01:04:49,672 --> 01:04:52,044
Think I won't be
able to get you sacked?

817
01:04:52,137 --> 01:04:53,328
Why don't you give it a try, then?

818
01:04:53,415 --> 01:04:55,275
<i>If we want him to
confess against Jo Pilyeon,</i>

819
01:04:55,376 --> 01:04:58,252
<i>we must force him to join our side.</i>

820

That James might in fact be Lee Gangmo.

821
01:05:00,984 --> 01:05:02,581
<i>I'm sure I saw Gangmo.</i>

822
01:05:02,712 --> 01:05:04,339
<i>I have no doubt it was him.</i>

823
01:05:04,412 --> 01:05:06,010
<i>I need your consolation today.</i>

824
01:05:06,111 --> 01:05:07,960
<i>Try to console me, will you?</i>

825
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:09,035
You liar...

826
01:05:09,126 --> 01:05:11,278
Hey... Forget it, then!
Forget I ever mentioned it!

827
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:13,980
I'll introduce our new member, then.

828
01:05:14,140 --> 01:05:15,680
<i>I'm president of Hangang Construction,</i>

829

Lee Gangmo.
