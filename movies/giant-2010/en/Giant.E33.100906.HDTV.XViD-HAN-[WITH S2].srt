4
00:00:12,647 --> 00:00:14,191
Yes.

5
00:00:14,585 --> 00:00:16,551
<i>It's me, Jo Minwoo.</i>

6
00:00:17,501 --> 00:00:20,666
You're having it quite hard
these days, aren't you?

7
00:00:23,225 --> 00:00:27,579
I just wanted to let you in
on a precious bit of information.

8
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:31,494
<i>You should be receiving a fax by now.</i>

9
00:00:31,924 --> 00:00:33,961
<i>You'll have to go through with it
even if you don't want to.</i>

10
00:00:34,127 --> 00:00:36,374
<i>If you want to survive.</i>

11
00:00:37,389 --> 00:00:39,390
<i>I can't wait...</i>

12
00:00:40,216 --> 00:00:46,102
<i>To see how you'll cause
Hwang Jeongyeon's downfall.</i>

13
00:00:55,941 --> 00:00:57,607
Jeongyeon...

14
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:07,030
I hope you won't
disappoint me, Lee Gangmo.

15
00:01:08,077 --> 00:01:11,597
As while you worry about
bringing Hwang Jeongyeon down,

16
00:01:13,019 --> 00:01:16,057
I'll be getting my hands
on Manbo Construction.

17
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,018
What is he scheming?!

18
00:01:27,277 --> 00:01:28,987
Jo Minwoo!

19
00:01:46,688 --> 00:01:48,903
<i>- No Trespassing -</i>

20
00:01:59,064 --> 00:02:01,947
Hey... Guess it's not the right place.

21
00:02:02,019 --> 00:02:06,120
There... Try digging over there.

22
00:02:06,236 --> 00:02:08,243
- Here?
- Yeah.

23
00:02:11,105 --> 00:02:13,830
Not there, you fool.
Farther back!

24
00:02:13,873 --> 00:02:16,297
Here.

25
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:17,961
You do it then, dammit!

26
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:19,782
Excuse me?

27
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,848
<i>What did I just hear?</i>

28
00:02:22,005 --> 00:02:25,261
We're getting a little sassy, aren't we?

29
00:02:25,376 --> 00:02:27,446
This... This...

30
00:02:27,633 --> 00:02:29,555
It must be a caveman's bone, I bet?

31
00:02:29,698 --> 00:02:31,978
Wow... What an epochal
discovery I've just made!

32
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:37,228
Hey... Guess someone around here
had some dog soup?

33
00:02:37,342 --> 00:02:38,633
It's a dog bone?

34
00:02:38,777 --> 00:02:39,637
Ehh...

35
00:02:39,737 --> 00:02:42,709
Move out the way.

36
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,526
Wow...

37
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,433
You do look like a tomb raider?!

38
00:02:51,548 --> 00:02:53,796
I ought to...

39
00:02:54,244 --> 00:02:56,109
That!

40
00:03:07,772 --> 00:03:10,371
Jo Minwoo was right...

41
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,623
Gangmo.
What do we do now?

42
00:03:12,766 --> 00:03:13,913
What do you think?

43
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:15,284
If we let the press in on this,

44
00:03:15,355 --> 00:03:18,324
Manbo Construction will be forced
to halt the construction. Then what?

45
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:21,336
All the buyers will
come our way, what else?

46
00:03:21,436 --> 00:03:23,832
If we got these out of
a few hours of digging,

47
00:03:23,932 --> 00:03:27,044
think of how many more
will be buried in there.

48
00:03:27,276 --> 00:03:28,392
Good job.

49
00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:30,431
You and Sotae can go to sleep.

50
00:03:30,561 --> 00:03:32,081
Can we?

51
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:35,795
Let's go get a drink
and then call it a night.

52
00:03:35,925 --> 00:03:38,377
If you're treating,
I sure could give it a thought?

53
00:03:38,434 --> 00:03:43,540
All right...
I'm treating, you pay.

54
00:03:46,538 --> 00:03:50,524
Jo Minwoo might be trying to
gain control of Manbo Construction.

55
00:03:50,767 --> 00:03:52,326
What?!

56
00:03:52,764 --> 00:03:54,955
Who's Jo Minwoo's closest
confidant within the company?

57
00:03:55,084 --> 00:03:56,892
Wouldn't go so far
as to call him confidant,

58
00:03:57,021 --> 00:04:00,348
but Chief Moon Seongjoong
is always around him, so...

59
00:04:00,764 --> 00:04:03,740
Then, stick to him for now.

60
00:04:03,855 --> 00:04:05,690
All right.

61
00:04:06,809 --> 00:04:09,046
But, Gangmo...

62
00:04:09,424 --> 00:04:11,585
Are you really all right?

63
00:04:11,923 --> 00:04:13,148
And if I'm not?

64
00:04:13,263 --> 00:04:18,211
Are you really going to keep
fighting with Jeongyeon to the end?

65
00:04:23,595 --> 00:04:24,986
You still haven't left?

66
00:04:25,101 --> 00:04:29,315
Why is the president
refusing to meet me?

67
00:04:29,805 --> 00:04:32,189
<i>You still can't realize why?</i>

68
00:04:35,913 --> 00:04:41,191
There is no bank in Korea willing
to lend money to Hangang Construction.

69
00:04:41,363 --> 00:04:45,880
Were you the one who
was stopping our bank loan?

70
00:04:46,124 --> 00:04:47,974
Who else did you think it could be?

71
00:04:48,132 --> 00:04:52,957
I suggest you stop trying
to interfere in my business.

72
00:04:53,603 --> 00:04:55,554
This is a warning.

73
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:59,137
We're in a fight that can
only end with your foe's demise,

74
00:04:59,252 --> 00:05:01,202
and you "warn" me?

75
00:05:01,685 --> 00:05:04,286
I see you've still
got time to waste doing that.

76
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:11,260
You might believe that refusing the
acquisition proposal I made is your last stand,

77
00:05:11,389 --> 00:05:14,011
but let's pretend I never mentioned it.

78
00:05:14,107 --> 00:05:16,854
Since the situation has now changed.

79
00:05:23,995 --> 00:05:28,752
You will end up on a street.

80
00:05:29,225 --> 00:05:33,901
And that's because I will
destroy Hangang Construction.

81
00:05:41,342 --> 00:05:42,501
Here you are.

82
00:05:42,673 --> 00:05:43,978
How have you been, President?

83
00:05:44,107 --> 00:05:46,617
Please, come on in.

84
00:05:54,213 --> 00:05:56,147
<i>Gangmo...</i>

85
00:05:59,435 --> 00:06:02,302
If you can't do it because of her,

86
00:06:02,646 --> 00:06:04,224
let me.

87
00:06:05,787 --> 00:06:06,863
If anyone does it, I will.

88
00:06:06,977 --> 00:06:07,895
Gangmo...

89
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:09,788
Enough.

90
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,430
<i>You know...</i>

91
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:16,236
that I wouldn't bear to
see you get ruined, don't you?

92
00:06:17,073 --> 00:06:22,481
Do you know why a scumbag like me
has been sticking to you all this time?

93
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,991
Think it was just to make it big?

94
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:32,671
Gangmo, it's...

95
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,660
because I wanted to see you succeed.

96
00:06:36,355 --> 00:06:41,435
<i>Because I wanted to
see your dreams come true.</i>

97
00:06:43,364 --> 00:06:47,003
Leave all the dirty work to me.

98
00:06:47,331 --> 00:06:51,360
As if it's for Lee Gangmo's sake,
I'm even prepared to die.

99
00:06:52,849 --> 00:06:54,042
Go ahead first.

100
00:06:54,148 --> 00:06:57,260
I'll drop by the newspaper
on my way to the office.

101
00:06:58,306 --> 00:07:01,101
I said I'll do it.

102
00:07:14,799 --> 00:07:16,212
What's this?

103
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:19,407
How much does your loan to
Manbo Construction amount to?

104
00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:21,317
<i>And why are you...</i>

105
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:24,349
I was just asking
out of concern for you.

106
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,555
<i>What are you trying to say?</i>

107
00:07:37,904 --> 00:07:43,600
These are Baekje relics found
on Manbo Construction's site.

108
00:07:44,345 --> 00:07:46,361
Should the press get a hold of this,

109
00:07:46,608 --> 00:07:49,366
the construction will have
to be stopped immediately.

110
00:08:02,113 --> 00:08:04,185
Get out of the way!

111
00:08:07,728 --> 00:08:10,410
Start digging... Now!

112
00:08:15,642 --> 00:08:17,898
Move out of the way.

113
00:08:49,476 --> 00:08:50,443
Director!

114
00:08:50,573 --> 00:08:52,142
Director...

115
00:09:26,712 --> 00:09:28,615
What are you going to do?

116
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:35,983
Hand the report to the press.

117
00:10:28,444 --> 00:10:31,015
<i>- Baekje Relics Found on Site -
Complications Brewing for Manbo Construction</i>

118
00:10:39,465 --> 00:10:42,214
Handled quite neatly, I see.

119
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,243
Manbo Construction's stock price
will soon begin to fall.

120
00:10:46,325 --> 00:10:50,002
And I'm sure you've been preparing
the capital to buy those shares?!

121
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:51,858
Certainly.

122
00:10:52,422 --> 00:10:57,249
You will soon be able to get
your hands on Manbo Construction.

123
00:11:08,795 --> 00:11:10,263
Yes?

124
00:11:15,415 --> 00:11:16,806
Go ahead.

125
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:20,629
<i>The chairman has regained his speech.</i>

126
00:11:22,758 --> 00:11:24,705
That's great to hear.

127
00:11:26,396 --> 00:11:28,369
Oh Namsuk still doesn't know this, right?

128
00:11:28,593 --> 00:11:30,216
<i>No.</i>

129
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:33,329
She must never be told.

130
00:11:33,587 --> 00:11:35,619
You understand what I'm saying, right?

131
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,651
Ohh... Miss Kim.

132
00:11:37,734 --> 00:11:40,647
<i>Hello? Miss Kim?</i>

133
00:11:42,138 --> 00:11:44,568
The chairman's condition
is still the same, right?

134
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,518
Yes.

135
00:11:53,613 --> 00:11:54,870
I'll have to hang up.

136
00:11:54,975 --> 00:11:57,369
His wife is here.

137
00:12:01,798 --> 00:12:04,382
How have you been, Dear?

138
00:12:05,908 --> 00:12:08,822
Dreamed that you would get back
on your feet last night.

139
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:10,671
You can't imagine how startled I was.

140
00:12:10,777 --> 00:12:14,888
<i>I even changed the testament now,
you can't do that to me...</i>

141
00:12:15,076 --> 00:12:17,190
Isn't that right, Honey?

142
00:12:19,951 --> 00:12:24,102
Know what this is?

143
00:12:24,968 --> 00:12:28,624
<i>{\a6}- Petition for Adjudication of Incompetence -</i>

144
00:12:25,981 --> 00:12:29,529
<i>I filed for an incompetence adjudication.</i>

145
00:12:29,811 --> 00:12:33,934
The court will soon announce the verdict.

146
00:12:34,357 --> 00:12:35,719
With that,

147
00:12:35,931 --> 00:12:38,181
even without having
to wait for your death,

148
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:42,222
Jeongshik will be able to
become the new chairman.

149
00:12:44,217 --> 00:12:46,134
<i>Namsuk...</i>

150
00:12:46,615 --> 00:12:49,675
<i>Why have you suddenly
become so scary?</i>

151
00:12:49,874 --> 00:12:53,833
<i>Are you the same Oh Namsuk I knew?</i>

152
00:12:54,362 --> 00:12:58,449
What are you, reflecting on
all the years you spent ignoring me?

153
00:12:58,637 --> 00:13:03,242
<i>Or is it just plain resentment?</i>

154
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,226
If you were capable of
throwing puppy eyes at me,

155
00:13:06,296 --> 00:13:08,916
you should have tried
while you still could.

156
00:13:09,551 --> 00:13:12,287
None of this would
have happened, then.

157
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:44,004
Miss Kim, don't you want
to earn some easy money?

158
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:44,850
Excuse me?

159
00:13:44,979 --> 00:13:46,835
Help me out just this once,

160
00:13:46,917 --> 00:13:50,547
and you'll get your hands on the kind of
money a lifetime of work wouldn't give you.

161
00:13:53,856 --> 00:13:56,480
Write down your account number.

162
00:13:56,986 --> 00:13:59,053
Don't you worry and just write it down.

163
00:13:59,253 --> 00:14:03,352
It won't be all that hard
for someone like you.

164
00:14:58,292 --> 00:15:00,285
This is home.

165
00:15:05,847 --> 00:15:08,214
Let's go in.
They'll be waiting for us.

166
00:15:09,817 --> 00:15:11,770
How do I look?

167
00:15:11,863 --> 00:15:13,235
Is the make-up looking all right?

168
00:15:13,376 --> 00:15:14,763
You're pretty.

169
00:15:14,857 --> 00:15:16,401
Let's get going.

170
00:15:16,508 --> 00:15:18,264
Minwoo...

171
00:15:18,928 --> 00:15:21,829
What should I tell them?

172
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:27,516
Just let me handle it.

173
00:15:27,692 --> 00:15:30,981
They already gave us their consent,
what's there to worry about?

174
00:15:31,815 --> 00:15:33,612
Come on, let's go in.

175
00:15:48,184 --> 00:15:49,840
Come on in.

176
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,008
How are you?

177
00:15:55,899 --> 00:15:58,773
Honey, serve us some tea, please.

178
00:16:02,685 --> 00:16:05,057
Have a seat.

179
00:16:12,758 --> 00:16:17,136
Our Minwoo got himself
quite the radiant beauty, I see.

180
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,702
Thank you.

181
00:16:18,796 --> 00:16:20,755
So your parents passed away?

182
00:16:21,005 --> 00:16:22,395
Yes...

183
00:16:23,158 --> 00:16:25,320
Must have been hard, all these years.

184
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:29,372
Any other family...
Brothers or sisters?

185
00:16:29,804 --> 00:16:32,075
- That...
- She has no family.

186
00:16:34,245 --> 00:16:35,880
She's alone.

187
00:16:36,493 --> 00:16:40,698
So I hear you passed your
GED test with flying colors?

188
00:16:41,046 --> 00:16:44,523
I'd love to see you graduate
from college, while we're at it?

189
00:16:44,617 --> 00:16:46,430
I was already planning to send her.

190
00:16:46,534 --> 00:16:47,607
<i>Must be busy.</i>

191
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,389
Worrying about work and finding
the time to look after students...

192
00:16:50,548 --> 00:16:52,832
I will pay my tuition.

193
00:16:52,926 --> 00:16:55,388
And how do you plan to do that?

194
00:16:57,014 --> 00:16:57,906
That's cute.

195
00:16:58,038 --> 00:16:59,877
You have quite the
independent spirit as well.

196
00:17:00,121 --> 00:17:02,752
I can understand how Minwoo
could fall head over heels for you.

197
00:17:04,384 --> 00:17:06,558
I think marrying as soon
as possible would be best.

198
00:17:06,746 --> 00:17:07,742
Minwoo...

199
00:17:07,874 --> 00:17:08,297
You...

200
00:17:08,381 --> 00:17:13,815
Men need to have a strong foundation
behind them to make it big.

201
00:17:14,482 --> 00:17:18,382
We'll leave our Minwoo to your care.

202
00:17:19,265 --> 00:17:22,985
<i>{\a6}*-in-law</i>

203
00:17:19,265 --> 00:17:22,985
Yes... F...ather*...

204
00:17:36,106 --> 00:17:38,700
Your father seems
like such a nice person.

205
00:17:38,813 --> 00:17:41,297
Think he liked you.

206
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,153
But... How did you
manage to convince him?

207
00:17:44,219 --> 00:17:45,892
Told you, didn't I?

208
00:17:46,167 --> 00:17:49,021
That I could do anything for you.

209
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:55,077
You've heard him say he wants to
get married right away, didn't you?

210
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:58,403
I told you to leave Minwoo to me.

211
00:17:58,826 --> 00:18:04,480
And if he starts refusing to
break up with her later, then what?

212
00:18:04,776 --> 00:18:07,722
No need to stir up a hornet's nest.

213
00:18:08,567 --> 00:18:13,053
Just let him do as he pleases for now.

214
00:18:13,805 --> 00:18:17,404
I need to go out,
so make all the arrangements.

215
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:38,164
How are things going for Jeongyeon?

216
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:41,237
If I tell you, you'll only feel worse.

217
00:18:42,403 --> 00:18:43,869
Just say it.

218
00:18:44,142 --> 00:18:46,857
At today's shareholders' meeting,

219
00:18:47,374 --> 00:18:50,099
they might actually
kick her out of the company.

220
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:13,625
<i>- Construction Halted, Stock Crashes -
Formerly the Sector's Kingpin, now an Also-Ran</i>

221
00:19:14,741 --> 00:19:17,043
<i>Wake up, Hwang Jeongyeon.</i>

222
00:19:17,349 --> 00:19:20,451
<i>Nobody can help you now.</i>

223
00:19:21,203 --> 00:19:23,916
<i>If you lose out to the shareholders today,</i>

224
00:19:24,269 --> 00:19:26,747
<i>it is over for Manbo Construction.</i>

225
00:19:27,804 --> 00:19:31,728
<i>I can't ruin what my father
worked a lifetime to build...</i>

226
00:19:31,952 --> 00:19:34,547
<i>just because of Lee Gangmo.</i>

227
00:19:40,197 --> 00:19:42,476
The shareholders are coming.

228
00:19:49,611 --> 00:19:51,432
Hello there.

229
00:19:51,644 --> 00:19:53,746
You're one of our major
shareholders after all...

230
00:19:53,899 --> 00:19:55,332
My behavior was inexcusable.

231
00:19:55,426 --> 00:19:57,287
<i>Allow me to apologize.</i>

232
00:19:57,452 --> 00:20:00,788
No need to apologize,
it's all in the past.

233
00:20:02,561 --> 00:20:05,498
I see you still haven't forgiven me?

234
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:09,774
My... You sure know
how to hold grudges.

235
00:20:17,253 --> 00:20:20,189
That wench is going to keep up
with the attitude to the end!

236
00:20:20,341 --> 00:20:22,197
Still, remaining calm
was the wisest move.

237
00:20:22,303 --> 00:20:24,356
She's Baekpa's adopted daughter...

238
00:20:24,497 --> 00:20:27,546
If it weren't for that,
I'd already be all over...

239
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:30,125
Let's go in.

240
00:20:47,619 --> 00:20:50,203
What is going on with
the apartment construction?

241
00:20:50,297 --> 00:20:54,314
The Cultural Heritage Administration
announced a major excavation,

242
00:20:54,432 --> 00:20:55,606
how are you going to deal with that?

243
00:20:55,724 --> 00:20:57,838
<i>Have you seen how we're doing
at the stock exchange?</i>

244
00:20:57,967 --> 00:21:00,117
Our stocks are plummeting!

245
00:21:03,123 --> 00:21:04,382
Here... Everyone!

246
00:21:04,511 --> 00:21:07,829
If you want an answer, please be quiet.

247
00:21:09,774 --> 00:21:15,634
At the end of the day,
we won't have to stop the construction.

248
00:21:15,836 --> 00:21:16,855
I'll assume full responsibility, and...

249
00:21:16,914 --> 00:21:19,158
Do you even have what it takes
to assume responsibility?

250
00:21:19,263 --> 00:21:23,978
Shouldn't you face the repercussions
for causing all this in the first place?

251
00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:34,150
I'm rather curious how Director Hwang
will overcome this crisis.

252
00:21:36,499 --> 00:21:40,575
Moments of crisis always go
hand in hand with management.

253
00:21:40,822 --> 00:21:43,623
<i>Which is why, on the contrary,</i>

254
00:21:44,445 --> 00:21:49,203
this might turn out to be the
perfect proving ground for her.

255
00:21:49,426 --> 00:21:51,904
<i>And if letting her take her
first baby steps as a leader...</i>

256
00:21:52,022 --> 00:21:55,627
ends up putting the entire
company at risk, what will you do?

257
00:21:55,768 --> 00:21:56,907
<i>Well said!</i>

258
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:59,832
What if she fails?

259
00:22:01,369 --> 00:22:02,886
What would you like me to do?

260
00:22:03,015 --> 00:22:07,937
Would you be prepared to renounce
all your company holdings if you fail?

261
00:22:08,031 --> 00:22:10,912
<i>Ahh... Seems like that would be ideal.</i>

262
00:22:11,065 --> 00:22:17,290
Weren't you the first to force this project
on us, promising you'd take responsibility?

263
00:22:19,698 --> 00:22:21,519
Fine, then.

264
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:26,223
Should this construction
have to be halted,

265
00:22:27,002 --> 00:22:31,356
I'll relinquish all the
company shares in my possession.

266
00:22:40,424 --> 00:22:42,890
So what do you need to understand,
in order to sign a contract?

267
00:22:42,996 --> 00:22:45,557
Let's respect the line, shall we?
If you don't...

268
00:22:45,639 --> 00:22:48,415
Ehhh! Ajumma!

269
00:22:48,509 --> 00:22:50,858
Stay in line, you're
messing up the whole thing!

270
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,185
Aigoo... All right.

271
00:22:52,267 --> 00:22:54,205
All right, Ajeosshi.

272
00:22:54,311 --> 00:22:59,938
How many times do I
have to tell you... Gangmo!

273
00:23:01,165 --> 00:23:02,271
We hit the jackpot!

274
00:23:02,424 --> 00:23:06,840
They're all going crazy,
asking to sign with us. Take a look.

275
00:23:08,908 --> 00:23:11,445
<i>- Gangmo.
- Gangmo!</i>

276
00:23:19,944 --> 00:23:21,621
<i>What are you doing, Mom?</i>

277
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,876
You think you can buy an
apartment with this kind of money?

278
00:23:24,006 --> 00:23:26,406
Why... Is it not enough?

279
00:23:27,228 --> 00:23:30,141
But we brought everything
we have down to the last penny?!

280
00:23:30,247 --> 00:23:31,633
You can stop dreaming with this much.

281
00:23:31,715 --> 00:23:33,900
Couldn't you inform yourself
before coming here?

282
00:23:34,064 --> 00:23:37,482
I will buy an apartment for you...

283
00:23:37,623 --> 00:23:39,265
Mother.

284
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:41,157
Mother?!

285
00:23:41,287 --> 00:23:42,931
<i>Who's this fella?</i>

286
00:23:43,072 --> 00:23:45,797
Isn't he the one who scolded
us for not staying in line?

287
00:23:45,903 --> 00:23:47,266
I apologize for earlier on,

288
00:23:47,348 --> 00:23:50,226
I'm a director here at Hangang
Construction, Park Sotae.

289
00:23:50,331 --> 00:23:51,800
Dir...Director?!

290
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:54,028
Our Shideok is a director, too?

291
00:23:54,122 --> 00:23:57,517
But, will you really
buy us an apartment?

292
00:23:57,634 --> 00:24:00,688
Yes... When I've made
enough money later on.

293
00:24:00,794 --> 00:24:01,945
<i>Aigoo... Really...</i>

294
00:24:02,004 --> 00:24:04,796
Isn't there anything
we can get with this much?

295
00:24:04,878 --> 00:24:06,969
Even if it's small...

296
00:24:07,098 --> 00:24:12,219
Aigoo... And we saved a little money
to buy ourselves an apartment.

297
00:24:12,431 --> 00:24:14,404
Just let them sign
for whatever they have.

298
00:24:15,238 --> 00:24:16,319
Really?

299
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:17,505
Gangmo...

300
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:20,292
This is not even half the price.

301
00:24:20,385 --> 00:24:24,438
They looked after Miju and me,
when we were little.

302
00:24:24,661 --> 00:24:27,057
I always wanted to repay you
for your generosity.

303
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:29,054
Let's wrap up the contract, Gyeongja.

304
00:24:29,195 --> 00:24:31,051
All right, Oppa...

305
00:24:31,192 --> 00:24:32,790
Seal here, Dad.

306
00:24:32,884 --> 00:24:34,823
Your seal.

307
00:24:35,128 --> 00:24:38,100
But I could have bought you one later...

308
00:24:38,206 --> 00:24:40,978
Gangmo, we're so thankful...

309
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,191
Only people who've gone through
hardships could understand.

310
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,046
Despite all the work
we've done for them,

311
00:24:45,129 --> 00:24:47,913
Jeongyeon's family never gave us
enough to get ourselves our own place.

312
00:24:47,948 --> 00:24:50,380
I'm so thankful, Gangmo...

313
00:24:50,474 --> 00:24:54,485
<i>- Aigoo... Thank you...
- The hell are you crying for? Are we in mourning?</i>

314
00:24:54,579 --> 00:24:57,586
<i>I'm just thankful...</i>

315
00:25:00,386 --> 00:25:02,402
Please help us out, Commissioner.

316
00:25:03,213 --> 00:25:05,679
Aigoo, really...

317
00:25:06,243 --> 00:25:08,704
We can't just halt
the construction like this.

318
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:11,124
If you were aware something
like this had happened,

319
00:25:11,229 --> 00:25:14,213
you should have come to me
before the press got a hold of it.

320
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:16,751
I only found out later myself.

321
00:25:16,875 --> 00:25:18,865
It is all my fault.

322
00:25:20,358 --> 00:25:21,726
Yes.

323
00:25:22,184 --> 00:25:26,425
Ahh... How have you been,
Commissioner Han?

324
00:25:27,235 --> 00:25:29,876
What brings you here, all of a sudden?

325
00:25:30,011 --> 00:25:32,761
I see you're here as well.

326
00:25:33,709 --> 00:25:37,888
What is going on with Manbo
Construction's apartment project?

327
00:25:38,465 --> 00:25:42,784
The higher-ups still
haven't made any decision.

328
00:25:42,889 --> 00:25:44,451
Not only Songpa,

329
00:25:44,569 --> 00:25:47,791
but also Jamshil and Pungnap-Dong
have been proposed as historical sites.

330
00:25:47,909 --> 00:25:49,154
If we went by the book all the way,

331
00:25:49,236 --> 00:25:51,374
who would ever build anything there?

332
00:25:51,468 --> 00:25:54,334
Yes... You certainly have a point.

333
00:25:54,475 --> 00:25:58,293
Then, are you telling me you could
help us continue the construction?

334
00:25:58,948 --> 00:26:04,129
You should come to our rescue
in situations like this.

335
00:26:04,587 --> 00:26:07,524
I am indeed trying everything
in my power to help you out,

336
00:26:07,665 --> 00:26:11,901
but it seems that someone from above
is purposely delaying things.

337
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:17,664
Then, I'll have to put in a good
word where it counts, I suppose?

338
00:26:21,399 --> 00:26:24,159
I think even the higher-ups believe
that development is necessary,

339
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:29,401
if we are to successfully host the
1988 Olympics and 1986 Asian Games.

340
00:26:29,528 --> 00:26:32,895
I'll see what I can do,
so don't you worry too much,

341
00:26:33,052 --> 00:26:34,722
and focus on your company instead.

342
00:26:34,886 --> 00:26:36,836
Thank you.

343
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:43,047
If I think of how far back
Chairman Hwang and I go,

344
00:26:43,165 --> 00:26:47,088
this is nothing
compared to what I owe him.

345
00:26:57,768 --> 00:27:00,235
We have no more time to waste.

346
00:27:00,575 --> 00:27:06,247
Send the chairman to a
better place by tomorrow.

347
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,440
I'll be counting on you, Miss Kim.

348
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,402
<i>Mom!</i>

349
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:22,251
What did you just say?

350
00:27:22,487 --> 00:27:24,647
To a better place?!

351
00:27:25,669 --> 00:27:28,112
What is that supposed to mean?

352
00:27:28,864 --> 00:27:33,402
Your father will spend the rest of his
life in a vegetative state, anyway.

353
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,258
Mom!

354
00:27:36,622 --> 00:27:38,277
Be that as it may...

355
00:27:38,571 --> 00:27:39,745
How could you do this to him...

356
00:27:39,851 --> 00:27:42,153
I married your father out of love.

357
00:27:42,365 --> 00:27:44,338
And it was that same sentiment
which gave birth to you.

358
00:27:44,491 --> 00:27:46,870
Think I'm enjoying all this?

359
00:27:47,068 --> 00:27:49,397
This is all for your sake.

360
00:27:49,808 --> 00:27:53,502
Haven't you had it with
being ignored all your life?

361
00:27:53,655 --> 00:27:54,903
Mom...

362
00:27:56,184 --> 00:27:57,600
Must you really go this far?

363
00:27:57,666 --> 00:27:59,411
The hell do you know, anyway?

364
00:27:59,975 --> 00:28:01,629
Do you even realize how it feels?

365
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,903
What could you possibly know?

366
00:28:07,906 --> 00:28:12,307
Just pretend you didn't hear this.

367
00:28:13,113 --> 00:28:17,306
I'll take care of everything else.

368
00:28:19,333 --> 00:28:21,232
How could this happen?

369
00:28:21,392 --> 00:28:24,540
Why did things have
to get to this point?

370
00:28:26,843 --> 00:28:28,117
Jeongshik...

371
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:30,155
Jeongshik!

372
00:28:46,365 --> 00:28:51,063
That man's life is over, anyway.

373
00:28:51,907 --> 00:28:54,188
He's merely leaving us a little earlier.

374
00:28:55,699 --> 00:29:00,409
He can do that much for us, can't he?

375
00:29:18,418 --> 00:29:19,771
Yes?

376
00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:27,713
All right.

377
00:29:27,864 --> 00:29:29,771
I'll come there myself.

378
00:29:35,172 --> 00:29:36,830
Oh Namsuk...

379
00:29:38,381 --> 00:29:41,181
So you plan to go all the way...

380
00:29:50,642 --> 00:29:52,447
Dad.

381
00:29:53,435 --> 00:29:56,074
This has nothing to do with me.

382
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,867
I've always been nothing but a fool...

383
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:06,623
You always scolded me
for that same reason.

384
00:30:09,794 --> 00:30:15,770
I'm just a wretched, useless fool...
That's all I am...

385
00:30:17,334 --> 00:30:21,283
So I didn't even realize
she could go this far, Dad...

386
00:30:34,472 --> 00:30:36,786
No way...

387
00:30:37,093 --> 00:30:39,032
I can't let her do this to my father.

388
00:30:39,155 --> 00:30:41,100
No way...

389
00:31:15,104 --> 00:31:16,495
Don't worry.

390
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,788
They're just supplements.

391
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:39,611
Dad...

392
00:31:39,724 --> 00:31:41,265
Dad...

393
00:31:57,003 --> 00:31:58,611
Dad!

394
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:00,011
Dad...

395
00:32:00,405 --> 00:32:01,486
Nurse!

396
00:32:01,608 --> 00:32:03,168
Nurse!!

397
00:32:41,122 --> 00:32:42,568
What did you just say?

398
00:32:42,746 --> 00:32:44,870
Your father disappeared?!

399
00:32:45,095 --> 00:32:46,683
How about that nurse?

400
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:48,516
What?!

401
00:32:48,722 --> 00:32:50,066
She quit?!

402
00:32:50,592 --> 00:32:51,635
All right.

403
00:32:51,758 --> 00:32:53,637
I'll head there right away.

404
00:32:59,832 --> 00:33:01,618
What is it?

405
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:05,367
She said the chairman disappeared,

406
00:33:05,518 --> 00:33:06,847
where are you going?

407
00:33:06,932 --> 00:33:10,719
Uh? The chairman disappeared?

408
00:33:17,337 --> 00:33:21,274
If the construction is halted,
we'll be the only ones to lose money!

409
00:33:21,378 --> 00:33:22,317
Please have faith in us.

410
00:33:22,421 --> 00:33:24,150
That is never going to happen.

411
00:33:24,234 --> 00:33:25,747
The Cultural Heritage Administration...

412
00:33:26,358 --> 00:33:29,475
Hey... Think it's the first time
I go through something like this?

413
00:33:29,588 --> 00:33:30,922
Please, don't do this...
Just calm down, and...

414
00:33:30,979 --> 00:33:33,638
Forget that, and tell
your chairman to come out!

415
00:33:33,685 --> 00:33:35,358
If he doesn't compensate us
for our damages right away...

416
00:33:35,452 --> 00:33:37,208
Let go!

417
00:33:44,707 --> 00:33:46,102
<i>You dare...</i>

418
00:33:46,383 --> 00:33:48,695
lay your hands on one of my customers?

419
00:33:52,693 --> 00:33:54,000
Get up.

420
00:33:54,718 --> 00:33:56,424
Ahh... My back...

421
00:33:56,527 --> 00:33:57,843
I'm sorry.

422
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:59,886
I'll apologize on his behalf.

423
00:34:00,027 --> 00:34:01,428
I apologize.

424
00:34:01,615 --> 00:34:03,831
Give me back my money!

425
00:34:11,573 --> 00:34:13,951
Everyone, keep quiet!

426
00:34:15,854 --> 00:34:18,370
<i>Here is a new contract.</i>

427
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:24,289
A few clauses have been added which will
protect you from incurring any losses.

428
00:34:50,732 --> 00:34:53,586
So what's the reason
you wanted us to meet?

429
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:56,697
I have no intention of
sitting here staring at your face,

430
00:34:56,862 --> 00:34:57,801
so get to the point.

431
00:34:57,954 --> 00:35:00,162
If you want to protect your company,

432
00:35:00,803 --> 00:35:04,485
first try to find out what
Jo Minwoo is going after.

433
00:35:05,743 --> 00:35:07,563
And do you have any evidence
to support such accusations?

434
00:35:07,645 --> 00:35:13,938
The fact that the man who alerted me
to those relics was exactly him.

435
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,652
Really...

436
00:35:15,758 --> 00:35:18,154
If my guess is right,

437
00:35:18,965 --> 00:35:24,189
Jo Minwoo is trying to oust you and
gain control of Manbo Construction.

438
00:35:24,933 --> 00:35:26,527
And of course Jo Pilyeon is behind him.

439
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,606
How about you, then?

440
00:35:29,182 --> 00:35:34,292
If your "guess" is right,
then you let Jo Minwoo manipulate you.

441
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:39,488
After letting the puppeteer
move you around freely,

442
00:35:39,629 --> 00:35:42,918
what do you plan to accomplish
by telling me that?

443
00:35:44,713 --> 00:35:46,658
It's because...

444
00:35:48,877 --> 00:35:54,868
I don't want to see Manbo Construction
fall because of anyone that isn't me.

445
00:35:57,041 --> 00:35:59,003
Right...

446
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:02,900
as expected, Lee Gangmo.

447
00:36:03,962 --> 00:36:06,506
It went right as Minwoo predicted.

448
00:36:06,788 --> 00:36:08,503
He told me.

449
00:36:08,703 --> 00:36:12,003
That you'd come looking for me,

450
00:36:12,132 --> 00:36:16,983
<i>and try to frame him
and his father for all this.</i>

451
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:18,322
Ahh!

452
00:36:18,475 --> 00:36:20,260
He also said this.

453
00:36:20,742 --> 00:36:27,352
That Park Sotae came to our
construction site to dig up those relics.

454
00:36:28,069 --> 00:36:30,477
<i>The only people who are helping me now...</i>

455
00:36:30,595 --> 00:36:33,461
are Jo Minwoo and his father.

456
00:36:34,612 --> 00:36:38,300
So you want me to cut my ties with them?

457
00:36:39,545 --> 00:36:41,532
<i>You know...</i>

458
00:36:41,861 --> 00:36:44,856
The mere thought that I
once loved a man like you...

459
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:49,543
just makes me feel ashamed.

460
00:37:07,467 --> 00:37:08,677
Marriage?!

461
00:37:08,794 --> 00:37:11,688
So you're going to marry Chief Jo?

462
00:37:12,318 --> 00:37:12,906
Yeah.

463
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,079
Think I might.

464
00:37:15,431 --> 00:37:16,324
Eonni...

465
00:37:16,429 --> 00:37:18,567
What have we been doing while
she was winning the lottery?

466
00:37:18,638 --> 00:37:21,059
Did his parents
give you their consent?

467
00:37:21,309 --> 00:37:22,284
Yeah.

468
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:25,432
Minwoo's father is really nice.

469
00:37:25,561 --> 00:37:27,511
Then, how about singing?

470
00:37:28,149 --> 00:37:30,107
Even after I'm married,
I won't give up my dream.

471
00:37:30,177 --> 00:37:32,630
Minwoo said he'll help me.

472
00:37:33,934 --> 00:37:36,553
Made me lose all my appetite...

473
00:37:36,965 --> 00:37:39,208
What's wrong with you?
I did my best to make it tasty...

474
00:37:39,326 --> 00:37:42,239
Don't say that, and have some.

475
00:37:47,824 --> 00:37:50,311
What's wrong with her now?

476
00:37:51,604 --> 00:37:54,881
Miju... Are you all right?

477
00:37:57,711 --> 00:38:01,214
Don't know what did this to me,
but it's been this way for a while?

478
00:38:01,332 --> 00:38:03,681
Aigoo...

479
00:38:11,069 --> 00:38:15,888
You're the only committee member
who refused to give a penny.

480
00:38:16,206 --> 00:38:17,768
I apologize.

481
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:20,540
We've had our difficulties
here and there, so...

482
00:38:20,693 --> 00:38:23,688
Give me a little more time
to find the money.

483
00:38:24,967 --> 00:38:29,105
Our friend at the Blue House
is not enjoying this, you know?

484
00:38:29,516 --> 00:38:35,060
I'm losing face just
because of you, is that clear?

485
00:38:35,552 --> 00:38:37,926
A little more time is all I ask.

486
00:38:38,886 --> 00:38:42,729
One way or another,
I'll get you that money.

487
00:38:44,458 --> 00:38:47,664
<i>That money Jo Pilyeon is gathering...</i>

488
00:38:47,823 --> 00:38:51,742
<i>will end up in the
president's Swiss bank account.</i>

489
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:56,929
Then, being put in charge
of the consultation panel...

490
00:38:57,023 --> 00:38:59,268
Just a way to legitimize
his need for capital.

491
00:38:59,343 --> 00:39:01,834
Jo Pilyeon turned
that post in his favor.

492
00:39:02,754 --> 00:39:08,388
He's got an innate talent for
ingratiating himself with powerful figures.

493
00:39:08,603 --> 00:39:11,207
We can't let him get away with this.

494
00:39:11,329 --> 00:39:14,787
And how do you suppose we proceed?

495
00:39:15,187 --> 00:39:17,653
You need to put
a stop to him, Seonbaenim.

496
00:39:19,151 --> 00:39:23,249
If Jo Pilyeon continues to gain
power in the construction sector,

497
00:39:23,427 --> 00:39:25,109
we'll all be wallowing in
quicksands soon enough.

498
00:39:25,185 --> 00:39:28,709
Don't you know what kind of
money we're dealing with?

499
00:39:28,849 --> 00:39:32,332
You want me to bother a sacred cow?

500
00:39:36,392 --> 00:39:40,549
Gangnam's development rush
is about to fire up,

501
00:39:40,747 --> 00:39:43,190
but it's already shrouded in shadows.

502
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:48,922
I wonder if that city can
ever truly develop in peace.

503
00:39:51,534 --> 00:39:53,590
How much land have
you managed to sell so far?

504
00:39:53,703 --> 00:39:56,475
We'll get the rest of our
money in a matter of days.

505
00:39:56,578 --> 00:40:00,017
First, transfer what you have to me,

506
00:40:00,205 --> 00:40:02,663
and spare no effort to get
your hands on all the rest.

507
00:40:02,748 --> 00:40:04,599
All right, Chief.

508
00:40:34,985 --> 00:40:37,419
Gangmo.

509
00:40:37,551 --> 00:40:38,838
I finally caught them red-handed.

510
00:40:38,932 --> 00:40:40,220
Take a look at this.

511
00:40:40,661 --> 00:40:44,198
Chief Moon is selling that land
behind everyone's back.

512
00:40:44,348 --> 00:40:47,148
But this land belongs
to Manbo Construction.

513
00:40:47,334 --> 00:40:50,070
Shouldn't you let Jeongyeon know?

514
00:40:51,718 --> 00:40:54,669
They took advantage of what
happened to Chairman Hwang.

515
00:40:55,373 --> 00:40:57,751
And that's because they can
get out of any trouble...

516
00:40:57,901 --> 00:41:01,688
by simply claiming
the chairman ordered this.

517
00:41:01,968 --> 00:41:06,310
But... What is Jo Minwoo trying
to accomplish with this money?

518
00:41:06,386 --> 00:41:07,955
Find out where Jo Minwoo is.

519
00:41:08,086 --> 00:41:09,035
Why...

520
00:41:09,628 --> 00:41:11,017
Want to meet him?

521
00:41:11,141 --> 00:41:12,456
I'll have to meet him firsthand,

522
00:41:12,757 --> 00:41:15,366
and find out whether my guess is right.

523
00:41:20,327 --> 00:41:26,402
I'm happy that you
found someone you like.

524
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:30,565
Want to meet her right now?

525
00:41:30,678 --> 00:41:32,003
Now?!

526
00:41:32,172 --> 00:41:33,901
I'm sure she's at my apartment.

527
00:41:33,995 --> 00:41:35,950
Let's just go home
and have a drink there.

528
00:41:36,072 --> 00:41:37,501
Don't know about that...

529
00:41:37,604 --> 00:41:39,286
I am a little curious, I'll admit.

530
00:41:39,418 --> 00:41:42,105
But what kind of woman
are we dealing with?

531
00:41:45,304 --> 00:41:46,411
My...

532
00:41:46,533 --> 00:41:50,320
Do you like her enough to act like
that any time someone mentions her?

533
00:41:50,442 --> 00:41:53,938
She's like a blessing to me.

534
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:55,946
So who is this woman?

535
00:41:57,678 --> 00:41:59,717
Her dream is a tad
out of the ordinary.

536
00:42:00,234 --> 00:42:02,743
She sings well, so...

537
00:42:12,849 --> 00:42:14,550
We need to talk.

538
00:42:15,681 --> 00:42:17,050
I'll leave you two alone.

539
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:19,068
Just sit, Hyung.

540
00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:23,297
Let's not ruin the mood because of him.

541
00:42:33,438 --> 00:42:36,290
Thanks to you,
my job has gotten much easier.

542
00:42:36,643 --> 00:42:38,299
Don't enjoy this too much.

543
00:42:38,428 --> 00:42:42,540
I have no intention of letting you
gain control of Manbo Construction.

544
00:42:42,693 --> 00:42:47,767
I'm sure you know who got that
dying company out of trouble?!

545
00:42:47,884 --> 00:42:49,975
I know what you're plotting.

546
00:42:50,527 --> 00:42:52,313
While Jeongyeon and I fight each other,

547
00:42:52,407 --> 00:42:55,417
you'll make sure
company shares hit rock bottom,

548
00:42:55,558 --> 00:42:58,283
and then get your hands
on them on the cheap.

549
00:42:58,776 --> 00:43:01,666
Smarts as always, aren't you?

550
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:03,522
But...

551
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:07,104
How do you plan to stop me?

552
00:43:09,092 --> 00:43:12,681
Last time I checked, you allowed me
to manipulate you like a puppet.

553
00:43:12,822 --> 00:43:14,185
Jo Minwoo,

554
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:17,967
all the hell you put me through...

555
00:43:18,919 --> 00:43:21,320
is exactly what you're going
to experience from now on.

556
00:43:22,824 --> 00:43:25,031
Let's go, Hyung.

557
00:43:33,149 --> 00:43:34,561
Right...

558
00:43:36,471 --> 00:43:39,424
You've arrested him once,
if I recall correctly?

559
00:43:46,599 --> 00:43:49,165
Will you keep an eye on him for me?

560
00:43:49,658 --> 00:43:52,618
Never know when he might
go back to his old ways.

561
00:44:04,563 --> 00:44:06,360
Take good care of him.

562
00:44:07,276 --> 00:44:10,556
He's like a brother to me.

563
00:44:34,899 --> 00:44:36,933
He ended up ruining the mood, all right.

564
00:44:37,168 --> 00:44:38,749
Let's go to my place, Hyung.

565
00:44:38,937 --> 00:44:40,992
Will have to meet
your girlfriend next time.

566
00:44:41,168 --> 00:44:42,014
You're not coming?

567
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:44,281
I have something to do.

568
00:44:45,206 --> 00:44:48,451
Introduce her to me next time.

569
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:04,604
Jo Minwoo is preparing a secret fund
to gain control of Manbo Construction.

570
00:45:05,186 --> 00:45:09,036
I'll have to get
my hands on that money.

571
00:45:09,585 --> 00:45:12,630
Looks like you might need my help?

572
00:45:17,513 --> 00:45:19,439
Moon Seongjoong.

573
00:45:20,403 --> 00:45:21,718
He's a department chief
at Manbo Construction,

574
00:45:21,789 --> 00:45:23,797
<i>and was put in charge
of the secret fund.</i>

575
00:45:26,477 --> 00:45:27,768
I know it won't be easy,

576
00:45:27,967 --> 00:45:31,156
but we must stop
Jo Pilyeon's secret fund.

577
00:45:31,488 --> 00:45:33,284
Let's give it a try.

578
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:36,456
We need to.

579
00:46:20,429 --> 00:46:22,543
When did you arrive?

580
00:46:22,743 --> 00:46:25,194
Still haven't had dinner, have you?

581
00:46:25,617 --> 00:46:27,050
Just sleep.

582
00:46:27,355 --> 00:46:28,941
I had dinner.

583
00:46:31,736 --> 00:46:35,648
Then, I'll sleep a little while more.

584
00:46:58,393 --> 00:47:03,079
I see you've cheered up our Minwoo.

585
00:47:03,243 --> 00:47:06,673
<i>Looks like you're our good-luck charm.</i>

586
00:47:08,964 --> 00:47:10,832
Don't you like meat?

587
00:47:10,996 --> 00:47:12,828
<i>Why are you only eating salad?</i>

588
00:47:13,016 --> 00:47:14,634
What?

589
00:47:15,365 --> 00:47:17,969
She loves meat.

590
00:47:19,109 --> 00:47:20,894
Should I cut it for you, then?

591
00:47:21,024 --> 00:47:22,327
No...

592
00:47:22,445 --> 00:47:24,547
I can handle it.

593
00:47:34,535 --> 00:47:35,832
Miju!

594
00:47:40,401 --> 00:47:41,486
Really...

595
00:47:41,601 --> 00:47:43,151
Suits her just right...

596
00:47:43,292 --> 00:47:46,041
<i>Awww... I can't stand her.</i>

597
00:47:49,035 --> 00:47:50,458
Wait a moment...

598
00:47:51,115 --> 00:47:53,089
She can't be...

599
00:47:59,502 --> 00:48:00,582
Miju, are you all right?

600
00:48:00,665 --> 00:48:02,955
I'm fine.

601
00:48:03,739 --> 00:48:06,420
Still dealing with that indigestion?

602
00:48:11,742 --> 00:48:12,952
Pregnant?!

603
00:48:13,175 --> 00:48:15,524
Seeing how she only eats salad,

604
00:48:15,677 --> 00:48:18,555
and suffering from nausea like that.

605
00:48:18,755 --> 00:48:22,612
She might be pregnant indeed.

606
00:48:23,574 --> 00:48:26,113
What if she really is?

607
00:48:26,242 --> 00:48:27,781
Leave it to me.

608
00:48:27,886 --> 00:48:30,165
I'll take care of everything.

609
00:48:34,796 --> 00:48:36,359
I'm so sorry.

610
00:48:36,488 --> 00:48:39,037
I've been dealing with an
indigestion the last few days.

611
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:41,316
Can you eat anything?

612
00:48:41,692 --> 00:48:44,374
I do feel bad about it...

613
00:48:44,844 --> 00:48:46,227
But I'm afraid I can't.

614
00:48:46,336 --> 00:48:47,863
I apologize, Father.

615
00:48:47,969 --> 00:48:49,872
An old friend of mine
runs a traditional clinic,

616
00:48:49,954 --> 00:48:51,234
let's go together.

617
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:53,745
We'll have to get you some tonic.

618
00:48:53,887 --> 00:48:55,383
Tonic?

619
00:48:55,547 --> 00:48:57,556
<i>You don't need to bother.</i>

620
00:48:57,626 --> 00:48:59,353
If you want to become
my daughter-in-law,

621
00:48:59,494 --> 00:49:01,503
I want a healthy lady by my son's side.

622
00:49:01,608 --> 00:49:03,077
Let's go there.

623
00:49:07,961 --> 00:49:09,752
Consider yourself lucky.

624
00:49:10,105 --> 00:49:13,993
He's never done that for me before.

625
00:49:15,201 --> 00:49:18,339
Thank you... Father.

626
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:40,252
We'll prepare some tonic for you,
so come get it next week.

627
00:49:43,322 --> 00:49:45,714
You can go ahead first.

628
00:49:45,822 --> 00:49:47,200
Yes...

629
00:49:47,587 --> 00:49:48,504
Have a nice day.

630
00:49:48,562 --> 00:49:51,370
Yes, you as well.

631
00:49:56,567 --> 00:49:59,416
So, is she pregnant?

632
00:49:59,698 --> 00:50:02,280
There is no doubt.

633
00:50:17,477 --> 00:50:18,945
<i>Tonight at 7?</i>

634
00:50:19,062 --> 00:50:23,056
Yes, Moon Seongjoong and Jo Minwoo
are set to meet at a night club.

635
00:50:23,467 --> 00:50:25,076
How about the password?

636
00:50:25,546 --> 00:50:28,864
Looks like it might be Manbo
Construction's founding day.

637
00:50:29,157 --> 00:50:30,449
0316.

638
00:50:30,543 --> 00:50:32,329
Good job, Chanseong.

639
00:50:37,110 --> 00:50:41,362
So is it my turn now?

640
00:50:41,609 --> 00:50:46,409
It won't be easy to get both
account book and seal from him.

641
00:50:46,847 --> 00:50:48,363
Don't worry.

642
00:50:48,656 --> 00:50:51,029
I have something in mind already.

643
00:51:04,072 --> 00:51:05,877
It's me, Lee Seongmo.

644
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:09,353
How about a drink later tonight?

645
00:51:10,247 --> 00:51:12,689
Yes... It's been a while,
so thought I'd ask.

646
00:51:12,959 --> 00:51:14,134
Yes.

647
00:51:14,733 --> 00:51:17,444
Then, we'll go to the usual place.

648
00:51:17,663 --> 00:51:19,559
Yes, all right.

649
00:51:29,829 --> 00:51:33,209
This has all the
deposit money we encashed.

650
00:51:37,396 --> 00:51:39,804
It's thirty percent of the total sum.

651
00:51:39,909 --> 00:51:43,868
Gather the remaining seventy
percent all in the same account.

652
00:51:43,997 --> 00:51:46,190
All right, Chief.

653
00:51:50,230 --> 00:51:51,593
Minwoo.

654
00:51:51,884 --> 00:51:53,284
Hyung!

655
00:51:54,605 --> 00:51:55,751
What are you doing here?

656
00:51:55,857 --> 00:51:58,429
I came here to have
a drink with Director Jo.

657
00:51:58,547 --> 00:52:00,599
The owner said you were here.

658
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:02,972
Ahh... Say hi.

659
00:52:03,171 --> 00:52:04,722
He's like a brother to me.

660
00:52:04,863 --> 00:52:06,848
- I'm Moon Seongjoong.
- Pleasure to meet you.

661
00:52:07,036 --> 00:52:08,140
All the better, then.

662
00:52:08,234 --> 00:52:10,677
When Director Jo arrives,
we can all have a drink together.

663
00:52:10,771 --> 00:52:13,521
I'll get going.

664
00:52:13,632 --> 00:52:14,974
As you prefer.

665
00:52:15,236 --> 00:52:16,859
Yes.

666
00:52:22,813 --> 00:52:24,997
Almost ran out of drinks here?

667
00:52:25,404 --> 00:52:27,694
Order some more.

668
00:52:38,289 --> 00:52:41,552
Here...
Let's first empty this one.

669
00:52:45,534 --> 00:52:47,519
To our Minwoo's...

670
00:52:47,672 --> 00:52:50,138
happy marriage!

671
00:52:50,232 --> 00:52:52,037
Cheers!

672
00:53:18,791 --> 00:53:20,908
Remember, Hyung?

673
00:53:21,237 --> 00:53:26,182
The first night you
took me out for drinks.

674
00:53:27,792 --> 00:53:30,082
You said I was piss drunk that night...

675
00:53:30,235 --> 00:53:35,131
You puked all over my
one and only suit, you fool...

676
00:53:36,189 --> 00:53:37,962
Hyung...

677
00:53:38,691 --> 00:53:41,533
I'm so happy these days...

678
00:53:42,626 --> 00:53:45,109
You do look happy.

679
00:53:47,788 --> 00:53:49,914
Did I miss all the fun?

680
00:53:50,043 --> 00:53:51,474
You're here?

681
00:53:51,652 --> 00:53:53,909
- Dad...
- Ohh...

682
00:53:54,565 --> 00:53:57,842
Looks like Minwoo is already drunk?!

683
00:53:58,336 --> 00:54:01,953
Yes... I'm a little drunk.

684
00:54:02,117 --> 00:54:03,867
Seongmo is perfectly fine...

685
00:54:04,032 --> 00:54:07,509
How can you let him
outdrink you like that?

686
00:54:07,638 --> 00:54:10,093
Ohh Ohh... Look at him.

687
00:54:10,222 --> 00:54:12,040
He said he's really happy these days.

688
00:54:12,169 --> 00:54:13,497
Is that so?

689
00:54:14,967 --> 00:54:18,019
Forget him, and let's
have a drink by ourselves.

690
00:54:18,148 --> 00:54:19,252
Yes.

691
00:54:19,499 --> 00:54:22,414
- I'll pour you one, Sir.
- Sure.

692
00:54:27,590 --> 00:54:28,955
<i>Here...</i>

693
00:54:30,764 --> 00:54:33,243
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

694
00:54:47,601 --> 00:54:50,237
Have you found the nurse
who took away my father?

695
00:54:50,425 --> 00:54:51,853
She already erased her traces.

696
00:54:51,971 --> 00:54:55,765
I asked everyone at the hospital,
and nobody knew a thing.

697
00:54:56,294 --> 00:55:00,428
Director Ju... File a
missing report with the police.

698
00:55:00,522 --> 00:55:02,354
That's out of the question.

699
00:55:02,613 --> 00:55:04,203
My father is nowhere to be found.

700
00:55:04,321 --> 00:55:07,903
We won't gain a thing by
letting everyone in on this.

701
00:55:08,162 --> 00:55:09,627
And why is that?

702
00:55:12,937 --> 00:55:16,783
What did you do to him behind my back?

703
00:55:17,430 --> 00:55:19,021
Watch your mouth.

704
00:55:19,128 --> 00:55:20,087
I did what?

705
00:55:20,193 --> 00:55:22,695
You were the one who hid him
at that nursing home.

706
00:55:22,836 --> 00:55:25,009
What could you possibly be afraid of?

707
00:55:25,115 --> 00:55:26,689
If people learn of this,

708
00:55:26,818 --> 00:55:30,220
what will happen to the company
you're running into the ground?

709
00:55:31,467 --> 00:55:34,767
You'd only fuel the fire, got it?

710
00:55:37,854 --> 00:55:41,920
Until we find him, forget the police.

711
00:55:42,924 --> 00:55:45,635
Shouldn't you be smart
enough to understand that?

712
00:55:56,742 --> 00:55:58,542
She does have a point.

713
00:55:58,801 --> 00:56:01,701
We'll look for him again tomorrow.

714
00:56:33,516 --> 00:56:35,992
Jaechun, can you really drive?

715
00:56:36,122 --> 00:56:40,292
Yes... Had a little sleep earlier on,
and that sobered me up.

716
00:56:41,548 --> 00:56:44,415
Seongmo, come sleep at my place.

717
00:56:44,590 --> 00:56:46,858
Was going to ask myself.

718
00:56:49,801 --> 00:56:54,887
Minwoo, that fool needs to be taught
how to handle his alcohol.

719
00:57:54,881 --> 00:57:56,304
Here...

720
00:57:56,492 --> 00:57:58,842
I've really had it
with my father, Hyung.

721
00:57:59,018 --> 00:58:00,557
Want me to do it?

722
00:58:00,686 --> 00:58:04,162
Why did I have to be born his son?

723
00:58:05,032 --> 00:58:08,696
I've never seen you act
like that with your father.

724
00:58:08,837 --> 00:58:10,940
Do you really want to
become a film director that bad?

725
00:58:11,022 --> 00:58:15,967
My father will never
give me his consent.

726
00:58:16,966 --> 00:58:19,491
And I'll never
manage to convince him.

727
00:58:24,151 --> 00:58:26,277
Thanks, Hyung.

728
00:58:27,792 --> 00:58:31,351
You ended up getting a beating as well.

729
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:35,658
When you get him angry,
he just swings at everything in his way.

730
00:58:35,834 --> 00:58:40,709
But why do you work
under someone like him?

731
00:58:43,163 --> 00:58:46,629
Forget that and let's deal
with these bruises first.

732
00:58:47,487 --> 00:58:50,859
A grown-ass man like you...
Does this even hurt?

733
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,990
Let me do it.

734
00:58:58,888 --> 00:59:00,199
Hyung.

735
00:59:00,308 --> 00:59:02,068
Shall we go somewhere
and take a photo?

736
00:59:02,221 --> 00:59:03,501
Looking like this?

737
00:59:03,618 --> 00:59:05,439
Why not?

738
00:59:05,815 --> 00:59:08,270
Let's go, uh?

739
00:59:23,018 --> 00:59:27,105
How nice it could have been,

740
00:59:27,175 --> 00:59:29,619
if we hadn't met like this.

741
01:00:19,592 --> 01:00:21,694
Is Minwoo still sleeping?

742
01:00:21,870 --> 01:00:24,850
I tried to wake him up, to no avail.

743
01:00:25,329 --> 01:00:26,663
Shall I give it a try?

744
01:00:26,839 --> 01:00:29,036
We need to have breakfast,
so go wake him up.

745
01:00:29,188 --> 01:00:30,516
Yes.

746
01:00:31,690 --> 01:00:33,215
<i>Just let him sleep.</i>

747
01:00:33,426 --> 01:00:35,059
He'll come down eventually.

748
01:00:35,515 --> 01:00:37,138
All right.

749
01:00:49,141 --> 01:00:51,227
<i>How are you?</i>

750
01:00:51,361 --> 01:00:53,863
- I'd like to transfer some funds.
- Yes.

751
01:00:54,411 --> 01:00:56,576
<i>Yes, just a moment.</i>

752
01:01:03,631 --> 01:01:05,324
It's quite the amount?

753
01:01:05,429 --> 01:01:08,436
Please, follow me.

754
01:01:18,185 --> 01:01:20,136
Jo Minwoo.

755
01:01:20,418 --> 01:01:23,590
Take a good look.

756
01:02:19,956 --> 01:02:21,447
Dad...

757
01:02:22,236 --> 01:02:23,996
Have you seen my account book?

758
01:02:24,219 --> 01:02:25,476
Account book?!

759
01:02:25,652 --> 01:02:27,215
What account is it?

760
01:02:27,344 --> 01:02:29,035
It's important.

761
01:02:30,223 --> 01:02:31,943
You didn't...

762
01:02:32,719 --> 01:02:34,093
Hyung.

763
01:02:34,363 --> 01:02:36,184
What happened last night at the bar?

764
01:02:36,454 --> 01:02:39,931
You were drunk,
so we helped you get here.

765
01:02:40,133 --> 01:02:41,846
Maybe it fell down in your room?

766
01:02:41,986 --> 01:02:43,490
I looked everywhere,
but I couldn't find it.

767
01:02:43,596 --> 01:02:46,222
Maybe you dropped it in the car?

768
01:02:46,363 --> 01:02:47,819
Go take a look.

769
01:02:48,899 --> 01:02:50,063
Minwoo...

770
01:02:50,333 --> 01:02:51,766
Here's the key.

What's wrong with you two?

779
01:04:06,885 --> 01:04:08,353
<i>Why can't I?</i>

780
01:04:08,459 --> 01:04:09,986
Because our father!

781
01:04:10,162 --> 01:04:12,100
Was killed by Jo Pilyeon.

782
01:04:12,194 --> 01:04:13,416
Without Miju,

783
01:04:13,592 --> 01:04:16,664
my life would be meaningless...

784
01:04:16,758 --> 01:04:18,978
<i>My stepmother did it.</i>

785
01:04:19,096 --> 01:04:20,987
To oust me from my heir position.

786
01:04:21,069 --> 01:04:23,912

<i>The testament will be presented.</i>

788
