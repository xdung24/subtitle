5
00:00:12,433 --> 00:00:15,133
I really didn't do anything.

6
00:00:20,984 --> 00:00:22,837
What's wrong with you?

7
00:00:27,931 --> 00:00:29,732
Hyungnim... Blood.

8
00:00:31,543 --> 00:00:34,741
You have hemorrhoids or something?

9
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:45,388
Hyungnim! A knife.

10
00:00:58,328 --> 00:01:00,592
Who is it?

11
00:01:02,835 --> 00:01:05,279
Who sent you?

12
00:01:06,569 --> 00:01:08,406
G...Gangmo...

13
00:01:08,773 --> 00:01:11,081
It's a misunderstanding.

14
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,447
Was it Jo Minwoo?

15
00:01:18,087 --> 00:01:20,037
Jeongshik?

16
00:01:23,993 --> 00:01:25,821
Who sent you here...

17
00:01:25,962 --> 00:01:28,249
to kill me?

18
00:01:30,105 --> 00:01:31,877
Speak!

19
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:38,818
J...Jeongshik and...

20
00:01:40,034 --> 00:01:41,954
Jo Minwoo.

21
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:44,118
Both.

22
00:01:45,642 --> 00:01:47,358
What?

23
00:01:56,677 --> 00:01:57,929
<i>Help me!</i>

24
00:01:58,005 --> 00:02:01,308
Warden! Warden!!

25
00:02:14,325 --> 00:02:18,403
<i>Warden... Warden!</i>

26
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:24,007
Oppa, you've come?

27
00:02:24,073 --> 00:02:27,068
- Just got back?
- Why didn't you call me?

28
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,648
I had to go to the practice room, 
so I'm a little late.

29
00:02:29,714 --> 00:02:30,938
Is it going well?

30
00:02:31,306 --> 00:02:32,832
Oppa.

31
00:02:34,943 --> 00:02:36,938
Listen well and don't be shocked.

32
00:02:37,174 --> 00:02:40,308
I'll soon get my debut song!

33
00:02:40,414 --> 00:02:41,574
Debut song?

34
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:46,255
Yeah... The composer said he'll 
give me the song he's working on now.

35
00:02:46,376 --> 00:02:50,150
Does that mean our Miju
will officially become a singer?

36
00:02:50,392 --> 00:02:51,229
Yeah...

37
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:55,973
Oppa. He said if I keep working hard,
he'll even let me perform solo.

38
00:02:56,048 --> 00:03:00,208
Wow... You're really something?!

39
00:03:01,421 --> 00:03:06,078
Miju. How about you stop working
as a bus conductor now?

40
00:03:06,236 --> 00:03:10,978
Oppa will take good care of you,
so just focus on singing.

41
00:03:11,084 --> 00:03:15,695
Forget it... As if you didn't spend
enough getting me this house.

42
00:03:15,854 --> 00:03:18,634
It's not like I 
have any expenses anyway.

43
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:21,384
You need to save money 
and get married.

44
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:24,360
I want to see a little nephew soon.

45
00:03:26,864 --> 00:03:31,764
After you and Gangmo get married,

46
00:03:32,059 --> 00:03:33,107
only then I'll follow through.

47
00:03:33,201 --> 00:03:34,778
Ohh... Listen to that.

48
00:03:34,884 --> 00:03:38,152
That's why you're 
still single at your age!

49
00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:42,741
Have you visited Gangmo yet?

50
00:03:43,245 --> 00:03:46,533
Couldn't go this week.

51
00:03:47,298 --> 00:03:51,992
I'm too busy to visit him that often,
so at least you do it for me.

52
00:03:52,178 --> 00:03:54,796
All right, Oppa...

53
00:04:00,721 --> 00:04:02,402
<i>Twenty-five.</i>

54
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,933
<i>Twenty-six.</i>

55
00:04:06,653 --> 00:04:08,693
<i>Twenty-seven.</i>

56
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:12,555
<i>Twenty-eight.</i>

57
00:04:13,424 --> 00:04:15,277
Twenty-nine.

58
00:04:16,696 --> 00:04:19,089
And thirty!

59
00:04:21,536 --> 00:04:23,644
Park Sotae.

60
00:04:24,248 --> 00:04:25,822
<i>Visit for you.</i>

61
00:04:28,275 --> 00:04:31,191
I wasn't expecting anyone?!

62
00:04:56,483 --> 00:04:58,425
Young Master...

63
00:05:02,534 --> 00:05:06,046
I can't stay here any longer.

64
00:05:07,295 --> 00:05:11,039
Try to experience it yourself,
this is hell on earth!

65
00:05:11,133 --> 00:05:15,500
Only looking at him gives me chills.

66
00:05:16,352 --> 00:05:18,915
I can't take this anymore.

67
00:05:19,162 --> 00:05:21,611
It's still too early to give up.

68
00:06:03,018 --> 00:06:04,701
Who was it?

69
00:06:05,681 --> 00:06:06,901
Uh?

70
00:06:08,912 --> 00:06:12,154
Even you had visitors?

71
00:06:13,837 --> 00:06:15,767
She's this "Miss Kim,"

72
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,109
from the coffeehouse 
in Cheongnyang-Ri.

73
00:06:20,532 --> 00:06:25,325
Ahh... That wench, and I had
even paid my tab already...

74
00:06:25,514 --> 00:06:28,940
Guess that one night
left a lasting impression on her.

75
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,088
<i>Crazy brat...</i>

76
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,475
<i>There are people inside
who can do the job for you.</i>

77
00:07:04,569 --> 00:07:08,525
<i>I'll get them to work for us,
so contact their leader.</i>

78
00:07:16,582 --> 00:07:18,311
Are you Park Sotae?

79
00:07:18,499 --> 00:07:19,653
Yes...

80
00:07:20,018 --> 00:07:22,526
So I guess he called you?

81
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:23,842
The money?

82
00:07:23,925 --> 00:07:26,550
I'm sure he must have 
wired it already, check it out.

83
00:07:26,656 --> 00:07:29,282
Even people like us 
follow ironclad rules.

84
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:34,062
If one of my boys is not involved,
I'm not getting my hands dirty.

85
00:07:34,168 --> 00:07:35,798
I'm aware of that.

86
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:38,470
Just hold him for me.

87
00:07:38,565 --> 00:07:42,556
I'll take care of finishing him off.

88
00:07:42,897 --> 00:07:44,734
So who are we dealing with?

89
00:07:49,656 --> 00:07:52,194
Lee Gangmo is his name.

90
00:07:52,359 --> 00:07:55,714
He's sharing the same cell with me.

91
00:07:56,521 --> 00:07:58,659
Lee Gangmo?

92
00:07:58,858 --> 00:08:00,567
Yes.

93
00:08:06,654 --> 00:08:09,350
<i>We're past the deadline already.</i>

94
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,117
Have you watched that 
on TV yesterday?

95
00:08:12,246 --> 00:08:16,509
Cheonhye Construction's apartment ad 
has the same concept as ours.

96
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,277
We must stop the broadcast of our ad 
before they air it tomorrow.

97
00:08:21,465 --> 00:08:23,655
And we'll have to postpone the opening
day to after the ad is broadcast.

98
00:08:23,761 --> 00:08:26,034
Who made this mess?

99
00:08:26,163 --> 00:08:28,076
I'm sure it's not anyone from our team.

100
00:08:28,158 --> 00:08:30,242
Seeing how even 
the CM song is the same,

101
00:08:30,348 --> 00:08:32,079
it might be someone 
from the record company.

102
00:08:32,197 --> 00:08:35,552
They're the only one outside 
the company who knew our concept.

103
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,307
Seek legal counsel 
and prepare a lawsuit.

104
00:08:38,425 --> 00:08:39,838
All right, Chief.

105
00:08:40,014 --> 00:08:42,487
You'll come with me 
to the record company.

106
00:08:42,558 --> 00:08:45,031
We'll have to verify this firsthand.

107
00:08:48,657 --> 00:08:51,984
Drive slowly, why don't you?

108
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:58,035
If we mess this up,
our sale can end up in failure.

109
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:02,545
When did you get 
your driver's license?

110
00:09:07,092 --> 00:09:09,292
You didn't know how to drive.

111
00:09:10,523 --> 00:09:12,212
Yesterday.

112
00:09:12,707 --> 00:09:14,850
Yesterday?!

113
00:09:16,227 --> 00:09:18,738
You got your license yesterday?!

114
00:09:21,116 --> 00:09:23,518
What's wrong with this?

115
00:09:28,561 --> 00:09:29,935
Jeongyeon...

116
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:33,392
Start by changing gear,
and turn off the wipers.

117
00:09:33,462 --> 00:09:36,618
- Wait...
- Should I drive?

118
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:44,720
<i>It's all over... Bring me drinks!</i>

119
00:09:45,597 --> 00:09:47,922
<i>Drinks!</i>

120
00:09:49,276 --> 00:09:55,034
So all the songs Lee Hayoung 
released were all copied from yours?

121
00:09:56,809 --> 00:10:01,909
There was even Miju's 
debut song among them...

122
00:10:02,062 --> 00:10:05,936
The real problem is our contract 
with Manbo Construction.

123
00:10:06,077 --> 00:10:08,008
If they learn it was leaked by 
one of our people...

124
00:10:08,138 --> 00:10:10,292
Aigoo... It will be trouble.

125
00:10:10,398 --> 00:10:12,801
<i>I see you understand the situation.</i>

126
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:20,399
<i>How do you explain this?</i>

127
00:10:21,877 --> 00:10:22,942
We sincerely apologize.

128
00:10:23,048 --> 00:10:25,402
This is not something
a mere apology will solve.

129
00:10:25,484 --> 00:10:28,533
Do you know for how long
we've been preparing this project?

130
00:10:28,655 --> 00:10:33,902
One of our trainees took the songs
and ad plans he worked on,

131
00:10:34,774 --> 00:10:35,833
sold them all and ran away.

132
00:10:35,904 --> 00:10:37,446
Where is she now?

133
00:10:37,529 --> 00:10:41,486
She moved and hid her traces.

134
00:10:41,604 --> 00:10:43,641
<i>I apologize.</i>

135
00:10:43,794 --> 00:10:47,385
I will soon get you another CM song.

136
00:10:47,515 --> 00:10:49,069
We will soon file a lawsuit.

137
00:10:49,198 --> 00:10:50,682
Just so you know.

138
00:10:51,424 --> 00:10:56,014
- Chief...
- Wait! Chief Jo!

139
00:10:57,315 --> 00:10:58,357
<i>Seonsaengnim!</i>

140
00:10:58,439 --> 00:10:59,864
Seonsaengnim, what's wrong?

141
00:10:59,935 --> 00:11:01,171
Seonsaengnim!

142
00:11:01,241 --> 00:11:02,902
- Get a hold of yourself.
- Seonsaengnim!

143
00:11:03,008 --> 00:11:04,971
Call an ambulance! Quick!

144
00:11:05,054 --> 00:11:07,868
Yes... Yes.

145
00:11:17,075 --> 00:11:19,043
How did it go?

146
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:24,895
How is he doing?

147
00:11:25,407 --> 00:11:29,308
They said his blood pressure is high,
so he must not experience any shocks.

148
00:11:29,485 --> 00:11:31,322
How did it go 
with Manbo Construction?

149
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:35,054
There's no talking 
to that Chief of Planning.

150
00:11:35,254 --> 00:11:37,385
He refuses to withdraw the lawsuit.

151
00:11:37,456 --> 00:11:41,777
Then, does this mean we'll be ruined?

152
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:48,628
Miju... How about you
try to reason with them?

153
00:11:48,734 --> 00:11:49,700
What?

154
00:11:49,817 --> 00:11:53,726
Last time, it seemed like their
chairman's son took a liking to you.

155
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:57,494
You never know, he might withdraw 
the lawsuit if you ask him.

156
00:11:59,698 --> 00:12:04,535
If we go bust, you'll have to give up 
your dream of becoming a singer.

157
00:12:05,052 --> 00:12:06,372
That's right, Miju.

158
00:12:06,477 --> 00:12:10,502
It's a life-and-death situation,
every little thing can help.

159
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:12,045
Give it a try.

160
00:12:12,421 --> 00:12:15,895
Or he might even get incarcerated.

161
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,559
<i>Miju...</i>

162
00:12:28,776 --> 00:12:29,789
How about this?

163
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,425
Try it out.

164
00:12:31,814 --> 00:12:34,216
Do I even have to dress up?

165
00:12:34,322 --> 00:12:35,235
I can just dress neatly, and...

166
00:12:35,293 --> 00:12:39,391
Listen to her. How are you going to 
convince him if you dress plainly?

167
00:12:39,862 --> 00:12:42,735
What do my clothes have
to do with convincing him?

168
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:45,019
You've still got a lot 
to learn, all right.

169
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:48,028
But are these all 
the cosmetics you have?

170
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:49,900
Yeah.

171
00:12:50,539 --> 00:12:52,019
This won't do it.

172
00:12:52,191 --> 00:12:53,621
Get up.

173
00:12:55,731 --> 00:12:57,565
Where are you taking me?

174
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:59,559
Just follow us.

175
00:13:26,677 --> 00:13:28,941
Now that she's all 
dressed up, not too bad?!

176
00:13:29,082 --> 00:13:32,367
But have you ever hit on a man?

177
00:13:33,533 --> 00:13:34,510
Not really.

178
00:13:34,628 --> 00:13:36,512
Of course not...

179
00:13:36,641 --> 00:13:37,807
Listen well.

180
00:13:37,924 --> 00:13:41,682
Men can't resist a woman's eyes.

181
00:13:42,131 --> 00:13:43,568
Her eyes?!

182
00:13:49,113 --> 00:13:54,580
Give him this kind of penetrating
stare for a good five seconds.

183
00:13:57,711 --> 00:14:00,539
Seonhwa... I think 
I'm not cut out for that.

184
00:14:00,645 --> 00:14:03,058
- Let's just...
- Ehh! You...

185
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:06,390
If I only had a pretty face,
think I'd have you do it?!

186
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:10,236
The chairman's son will
fall for this, guaranteed.

187
00:14:10,448 --> 00:14:12,402
Follow after me.

188
00:14:30,697 --> 00:14:32,937
Just tag along.

189
00:14:35,184 --> 00:14:37,074
Can't even do this?

190
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,707
Hey! Here he comes.
Ready to go?

191
00:15:01,124 --> 00:15:04,123
Hey! What are you doing?
Hurry up!

192
00:15:06,663 --> 00:15:08,952
Ohh... What the...

193
00:15:10,188 --> 00:15:11,391
Oh?!

194
00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:12,533
<i>Who's this?</i>

195
00:15:12,792 --> 00:15:14,723
Isn't this country chick?!

196
00:15:17,548 --> 00:15:19,055
How are you...

197
00:15:19,161 --> 00:15:23,294
Wow... 
You look completely different?!

198
00:15:23,447 --> 00:15:25,211
<i>But, what brings you here?</i>

199
00:15:25,294 --> 00:15:27,295
Came to see me?

200
00:15:28,786 --> 00:15:29,909
Yes...

201
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:32,440
I had something to tell you.

202
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:34,312
To me?

203
00:15:35,513 --> 00:15:38,581
We were heading out for lunch,
care to join us?

204
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:42,890
Follow me.

205
00:15:46,789 --> 00:15:48,530
Follow him!

206
00:15:48,836 --> 00:15:50,694
Remember the killer stare, all right?

207
00:15:50,765 --> 00:15:52,296
Killer stare!

208
00:15:52,637 --> 00:15:54,132
<i>What are you waiting for?</i>

209
00:15:54,432 --> 00:15:57,005
Yes... I'm coming.

210
00:16:02,183 --> 00:16:02,972
<i>Are you all right?</i>

211
00:16:03,043 --> 00:16:06,151
I'm... fine...

212
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:08,859
Let's go.

213
00:16:18,312 --> 00:16:19,855
What's this?

214
00:16:26,977 --> 00:16:29,406
Wow... You made all this?

215
00:16:29,548 --> 00:16:31,879
Looks good?!

216
00:16:32,173 --> 00:16:35,600
Where are the manners in bringing food
to a restaurant trying to run a business?

217
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,949
If we pay for our lunch, who cares?

218
00:16:40,101 --> 00:16:41,879
You're right.

219
00:16:44,116 --> 00:16:45,871
Have a taste.

220
00:16:50,627 --> 00:16:52,358
It's really good.

221
00:16:52,464 --> 00:16:54,511
Try it out yourself.

222
00:16:55,688 --> 00:16:57,219
Forget it.

223
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:17,850
<i>What did you use, to taste so great?</i>

224
00:17:19,804 --> 00:17:23,002
It's nothing all that special,
but it still tastes great?!

225
00:17:37,757 --> 00:17:40,262
Hey...

226
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:42,581
Over there.

227
00:17:46,772 --> 00:17:48,179
Hey.

228
00:17:49,827 --> 00:17:51,676
Aren't your eyes hurting?

229
00:17:53,999 --> 00:17:58,987
Make her happy and look. Seemed so
busy throwing loving glances at you.

230
00:18:00,356 --> 00:18:01,392
Really?

231
00:18:02,734 --> 00:18:07,455
Now that I think about it,
you really seem to have changed?!

232
00:18:07,573 --> 00:18:12,024
That's right! You need to take the 
initiative if you want to make it big.

233
00:18:14,357 --> 00:18:15,864
<i>Jeongshik.</i>

234
00:18:16,735 --> 00:18:19,490
Why do you think she
made this kimbap for you?

235
00:18:21,745 --> 00:18:23,387
<i>Ahh... Right.</i>

236
00:18:23,552 --> 00:18:26,499
We filed a lawsuit against
her workplace, right?

237
00:18:30,124 --> 00:18:34,258
Can't you withdraw that lawsuit?

238
00:18:35,859 --> 00:18:39,364
- Why the hell not, we could surely...
- No way.

239
00:18:41,498 --> 00:18:43,337
I don't remember asking you.

240
00:18:43,419 --> 00:18:44,538
I'm in charge here.

241
00:18:44,644 --> 00:18:48,547
- Still, the chairman's son...
- Minwoo.

242
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:52,014
Let's just withdraw it, shall we?

243
00:18:52,179 --> 00:18:54,096
If her company goes bust,
she'll have nowhere...

244
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:57,381
If that's how you want to handle it,
compensate us for the damages.

245
00:18:57,687 --> 00:18:59,948
Or just keep quiet about it.

246
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:02,056
Ehh... You really...

247
00:19:02,197 --> 00:19:04,352
Embarrass me 
in front of her, will you?

248
00:19:05,046 --> 00:19:08,263
You're exactly the
kind of girl I most despise.

249
00:19:08,498 --> 00:19:12,042
Vulgar little bimbos throwing their 
bodies around to make life easier.

250
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,608
What?

251
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,764
Do your parents even know
the kind of life you're leading?

252
00:19:21,347 --> 00:19:24,077
Makes me lose appetite, really...

253
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:29,592
<i>Ehh... Listen to him...</i>

254
00:19:29,686 --> 00:19:32,663
<i>Must you really talk 
like that to people?</i>

255
00:19:34,052 --> 00:19:36,631
The kimbap tastes great.

256
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:54,759
That Chief of Planning
is really an annoying prick.

257
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,490
Miju.

258
00:19:57,717 --> 00:20:00,051
Must we really do this?

259
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:03,524
It would hurt my pride
too much to bear it.

260
00:20:03,842 --> 00:20:05,219
So stay out of it.

261
00:20:05,313 --> 00:20:07,221
I can handle it by myself.

262
00:20:07,327 --> 00:20:09,996
Did I piss you off?

263
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,933
Fill in the kimbap.

264
00:20:13,075 --> 00:20:17,761
So you're really going to do that?

265
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,079
Young lady, what is all this?

266
00:20:45,781 --> 00:20:46,661
What is this?

267
00:20:46,838 --> 00:20:50,712
This young lady 
told me to give it to you.

268
00:20:59,952 --> 00:21:02,204
Where is she now?

269
00:21:07,253 --> 00:21:16,566
<i>{\a6}- Hyeeun's You Couldn't Possibly Know -</i>

270
00:21:07,253 --> 00:21:16,566
You couldn't possibly know
how much I loved you.

271
00:21:16,707 --> 00:21:26,546
As time goes by, 
you'll end up regretting all this.

272
00:21:30,951 --> 00:21:33,152
What's with you?

273
00:21:36,718 --> 00:21:40,594
I was rude to you last time.

274
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:44,501
I'm counting on you, Chief.

275
00:21:44,818 --> 00:21:48,598
So now there's nothing you
won't do to get what you want.

276
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,696
You've already eaten them all?

277
00:21:53,814 --> 00:21:56,623
I did try to make them tasty...

278
00:22:03,095 --> 00:22:05,780
<i>What are you, 
kidding around with me?</i>

279
00:22:06,204 --> 00:22:09,041
You think this will convince me 
to withdraw the lawsuit?

280
00:22:09,595 --> 00:22:12,023
Help us out just this once, Chief.

281
00:22:12,117 --> 00:22:15,378
We're all poor people.

282
00:22:15,555 --> 00:22:19,240
We've been struggling so much, and only 
now a little hope was on the horizon...

283
00:22:19,311 --> 00:22:21,989
I couldn't care less.

284
00:22:37,142 --> 00:22:39,627
How kind of him...

285
00:22:40,133 --> 00:22:43,171
Fine! Let's see 
who gets the last laugh!

286
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:46,762
I can't just give up now
after what you've done.

287
00:23:23,727 --> 00:23:25,034
Go ahead.

288
00:23:25,175 --> 00:23:27,094
Thank you.

289
00:23:33,643 --> 00:23:37,646
Your reputation precedes you, 
Seonsaengnim.

290
00:23:37,858 --> 00:23:40,495
I apologize for not
paying you a visit earlier.

291
00:23:41,792 --> 00:23:47,126
If money is the issue,
a late visit can only be a blessing.

292
00:23:48,103 --> 00:23:49,940
You've got a point.

293
00:23:50,257 --> 00:23:55,840
From what I hear, Manbo Construction
was funding your campaign?!

294
00:23:56,747 --> 00:24:00,326
Money is quite the strange entity.

295
00:24:00,479 --> 00:24:03,434
The more you use it,
the more thirst you get.

296
00:24:03,552 --> 00:24:08,466
And the more you make,
the more you desire.

297
00:24:08,713 --> 00:24:13,540
I hear most of the influential people
in our area are customers of yours.

298
00:24:15,212 --> 00:24:19,769
So it's not money you need,
but my connections?

299
00:24:19,863 --> 00:24:25,210
Of course, if you add money to
the package, it'd truly be a blessing.

300
00:24:25,952 --> 00:24:28,848
I'm not someone who
beats around the bush.

301
00:24:28,966 --> 00:24:30,508
If you extend me your help,

302
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:36,952
what you'll get in return will make
any interest pale in comparison.

303
00:24:41,614 --> 00:24:43,910
The tea got cold.

304
00:24:46,409 --> 00:24:47,950
Sir.

305
00:24:48,373 --> 00:24:50,328
Why don't you get up?

306
00:24:50,469 --> 00:24:53,224
This discussion has
gotten a bit long-winded.

307
00:25:01,777 --> 00:25:05,427
If he upset you in any way,
allow me to apologize on his behalf.

308
00:25:06,828 --> 00:25:11,420
He never involves 
himself with politics.

309
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:17,280
That's good to hear.

310
00:25:17,704 --> 00:25:23,662
Tell him hearing this lifted
a big weight off my shoulders.

311
00:25:23,791 --> 00:25:25,746
I'm sure he'll understand.

312
00:25:41,253 --> 00:25:46,492
What the hell were you doing while 
Cheonhye Construction aired that?

313
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:47,599
I apologize, Chairman.

314
00:25:47,669 --> 00:25:51,496
Forget the apologies 
and find a solution!

315
00:25:51,614 --> 00:25:56,062
Giving up on TV commercials and focusing
our efforts on radio and newspapers...

316
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,464
<i>That's out of the question.</i>

317
00:25:59,288 --> 00:26:02,502
We'll go on with the
commercial as planned.

318
00:26:02,997 --> 00:26:05,610
Seems like it might be
a little too late for that?

319
00:26:05,894 --> 00:26:08,783
All we need to do is match
the sale's start date.

320
00:26:08,937 --> 00:26:10,332
I'll go ahead with it, Chairman.

321
00:26:10,474 --> 00:26:12,746
But if we lose all other
media exposure because of it,

322
00:26:12,899 --> 00:26:15,831
we might even end up
with unsold apartments.

323
00:26:16,031 --> 00:26:17,974
What Chief Jo said is right.

324
00:26:18,233 --> 00:26:20,475
You can't just fight with your back
to the wall whenever you feel like it.

325
00:26:20,558 --> 00:26:23,819
But I think this is
exactly time to do that.

326
00:26:24,199 --> 00:26:25,868
And that's because our apartment
sales will decide the fate...

327
00:26:25,938 --> 00:26:27,940
of our status in the
sector rankings this year.

328
00:26:28,034 --> 00:26:32,273
Be it TV commercials or leaflets,
you better deal with it!

329
00:26:32,414 --> 00:26:37,984
But I don't want to see
any apartment go unsold!

330
00:26:42,668 --> 00:26:45,389
What is leading you to
make such reckless decisions?

331
00:26:45,531 --> 00:26:47,264
I'll take care of it, so stop worrying.

332
00:26:47,335 --> 00:26:49,914
Don't you sleep at night?
Are you going to starve all day?

333
00:26:50,043 --> 00:26:51,326
We have no time, none!

334
00:26:51,397 --> 00:26:53,481
I'll go on without food or sleep.

335
00:26:54,081 --> 00:26:57,131
I started this,
so I'll take it to the end.

336
00:26:57,308 --> 00:27:00,025
Is this because of Gangmo as well?

337
00:27:01,462 --> 00:27:06,719
Are you so obsessed with work
just because of Gangmo?

338
00:27:07,469 --> 00:27:10,751
Because everything I do for Gangmo 
is also for my own sake.

339
00:27:11,303 --> 00:27:11,870
What?

340
00:27:11,952 --> 00:27:13,672
You just wait.

341
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:20,023
By the time Gangmo is released, 
nobody in this company will doubt my skills.

342
00:27:20,219 --> 00:27:21,832
I told you, didn't I?

343
00:27:22,067 --> 00:27:23,951
That Lee Gangmo has changed.

344
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:28,409
I'm no longer your fiance 
or anything else.

345
00:27:28,538 --> 00:27:29,845
Still...

346
00:27:30,775 --> 00:27:33,189
I don't want to see
you get hurt any longer.

347
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:35,804
You've had to go through a lot.

348
00:27:35,979 --> 00:27:37,145
Life hasn't been kind to you.

349
00:27:37,227 --> 00:27:38,452
Give it a rest.

350
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:40,643
Spare me that kind of talk.

351
00:27:49,818 --> 00:27:51,937
Did you fight again?

352
00:27:53,723 --> 00:27:55,546
How did it go with Lee Gangmo?

353
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,514
Uh?!

354
00:27:56,608 --> 00:27:59,384
Why are there no news whatsoever?

355
00:28:02,154 --> 00:28:03,284
No worries.

356
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:06,450
I entrusted this to a ruthless man.

357
00:28:06,568 --> 00:28:09,523
He'll get things
done for sure, this time.

358
00:28:14,774 --> 00:28:17,153
Have a nice meal, Hyungnim.

359
00:29:12,258 --> 00:29:13,376
Why?

360
00:29:13,622 --> 00:29:18,003
Think I'd run out of ways 
to catch my prey?

361
00:29:20,032 --> 00:29:22,666
Screaming will make no difference.

362
00:29:22,984 --> 00:29:27,264
Thanks to these fellas here,
nobody is around.

363
00:29:27,617 --> 00:29:32,586
You were never destined
to become a decent person.

364
00:29:32,715 --> 00:29:35,588
You still don't get it, do you?

365
00:29:36,342 --> 00:29:39,635
Welcome to your funeral, 
you bastard.

366
00:29:39,741 --> 00:29:44,914
They'll only exploit you,

367
00:29:45,511 --> 00:29:47,206
after which you'll be 
abandoned like trash.

368
00:29:47,277 --> 00:29:51,680
You miserable twat,
still not having a clue...

369
00:29:52,563 --> 00:29:54,153
Fellas.

370
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,390
<i>Hold this prick for me.</i>

371
00:29:59,946 --> 00:30:02,247
There's no time to waste, hurry up!

372
00:30:03,313 --> 00:30:06,055
What... What's wrong with you?

373
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:11,110
What's wrong with you people?

374
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:20,229
So you're telling me he
was a childhood friend of yours?

375
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:25,834
Forget everything else,
but people betraying their friends...

376
00:30:25,928 --> 00:30:28,412
They more than deserve to die.

377
00:30:34,525 --> 00:30:36,880
<i>Ga...Gangmo!</i>

378
00:30:36,997 --> 00:30:38,139
Gangmo!

379
00:30:38,292 --> 00:30:41,000
You sure have little luck...

380
00:30:41,154 --> 00:30:45,743
<i>Of all people you could
ask me to get rid of, him?!</i>

381
00:30:45,884 --> 00:30:47,003
<i>What a shame...</i>

382
00:30:47,085 --> 00:30:49,676
I... I... I'm sorry!

383
00:30:49,758 --> 00:30:52,219
Forgive me just this once!

384
00:30:54,303 --> 00:30:56,911
I let money blind me!

385
00:30:57,170 --> 00:30:59,183
Forgive me, I beg you!

386
00:30:59,266 --> 00:31:01,067
<i>Mom! Mom...</i>

387
00:31:01,161 --> 00:31:04,811
Gangmo! Don't kill me...

388
00:31:05,223 --> 00:31:07,425
<i>Gangmo!</i>

389
00:31:17,295 --> 00:31:19,049
I, Park Sotae!

390
00:31:19,308 --> 00:31:24,087
Have dealt with retards 
like you all my life.

391
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:27,315
<i>I'll set the whole
damned thing on fire!</i>

392
00:31:33,671 --> 00:31:35,366
<i>Forgive me!</i>

393
00:31:35,437 --> 00:31:39,225
Gangmo! Gangmo, please...

394
00:31:48,985 --> 00:31:50,290
<i>Why?</i>

395
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:55,871
Letting this miserable fool go
just because you were friends?

396
00:31:56,644 --> 00:31:59,533
Exactly because 
he's a miserable fool.

397
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:09,272
Aigoo... You miserable fool.

398
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:13,617
You at least met a good friend.

399
00:32:38,989 --> 00:32:41,238
Hello.

400
00:33:26,235 --> 00:33:29,838
They're really good, aren't they?

401
00:33:31,863 --> 00:33:34,273
Come have some kimbap.

402
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:35,674
Go ahead and eat.

403
00:33:35,874 --> 00:33:38,818
But who's bringing kimbap every day?

404
00:33:38,888 --> 00:33:41,194
Ohh... The chief.

405
00:33:41,481 --> 00:33:42,291
What?!

406
00:33:42,373 --> 00:33:46,271
Don't even get us started.
He's spoiling us these days.

407
00:33:46,365 --> 00:33:51,370
- They're so firm.
- Tell me about it. Would never tire of them.

408
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:55,970
- Wow... They're really great.
- Especially when they offer them to you.

409
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,467
Thank you.

410
00:34:06,672 --> 00:34:09,086
- Thank you.
- Isn't that her? Country chick.

411
00:34:09,168 --> 00:34:11,570
Hurry up... Here...

412
00:34:12,194 --> 00:34:14,624
All right! Let's go.

413
00:34:14,777 --> 00:34:16,331
<i>She was a conductor?!</i>

414
00:34:16,461 --> 00:34:19,381
<i>Don't tell me...</i>

415
00:34:38,138 --> 00:34:40,349
Stay put and keep your head up.

416
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:42,021
No need. I'll handle it.

417
00:34:42,127 --> 00:34:43,822
I said stay put.

418
00:34:44,046 --> 00:34:47,343
If I go wash up it'll be fine.

419
00:34:52,907 --> 00:34:55,060
Jeongyeon. Jeongyeon!

420
00:34:55,417 --> 00:34:56,417
Jeongyeon.

421
00:34:56,559 --> 00:34:58,184
Jeongyeon. Wake up.

422
00:34:58,254 --> 00:34:59,208
Jeongyeon!

423
00:34:59,279 --> 00:35:01,115
Jeongyeon!

424
00:35:02,587 --> 00:35:04,436
<i>Jeongyeon. Wake up.</i>

425
00:35:04,612 --> 00:35:06,606
<i>Jeongyeon!</i>

426
00:35:07,169 --> 00:35:09,041
Jeongyeon is still not home?

427
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:11,537
She spent the night at work
yesterday as well,

428
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:13,751
how could she be 
so obsessed with work?

429
00:35:13,916 --> 00:35:16,942
Ohh Ohh... Really...

430
00:35:17,307 --> 00:35:19,473
<i>Do you ever work late?</i>

431
00:35:19,685 --> 00:35:23,570
Show some dedication
like Jeongyeon, will you?

432
00:35:23,806 --> 00:35:27,715
Mom... 
Why are you always bugging me?

433
00:35:28,044 --> 00:35:30,281
<i>- Agasshi!
- Wake up, Agasshi!</i>

434
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:32,712
<i>Agasshi, what's wrong?</i>

435
00:35:32,842 --> 00:35:35,279
<i>What's this?</i>

436
00:35:36,186 --> 00:35:39,753
What's the matter?

437
00:35:39,824 --> 00:35:41,625
What's wrong with Jeongyeon?

438
00:35:42,019 --> 00:35:43,462
She must have overworked herself.

439
00:35:43,544 --> 00:35:46,669
Are you telling me she fainted?

440
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:48,740
We just came back from the hospital.

441
00:35:48,933 --> 00:35:50,378
A good night of sleep 
and she'll be fine.

442
00:35:50,461 --> 00:35:53,647
Bring her to her room.

443
00:35:53,769 --> 00:35:54,970
I'll take her.

444
00:35:55,041 --> 00:35:56,312
Leave it.

445
00:35:57,291 --> 00:35:59,214
Don't worry.

446
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:06,031
Ahh... Really...

447
00:36:07,868 --> 00:36:09,398
<i>Aigoo...</i>

448
00:36:09,575 --> 00:36:12,430
Why would young people 
like you do this...

449
00:36:12,583 --> 00:36:16,002
She's hell bent on it, all right.

450
00:36:37,782 --> 00:36:39,862
Feeling better?

451
00:36:41,863 --> 00:36:44,136
What happened?

452
00:36:44,642 --> 00:36:46,385
You fainted.

453
00:36:46,502 --> 00:36:48,480
Collapsed right out 
of the blue, get it?

454
00:36:49,972 --> 00:36:52,268
It was just a nosebleed, that's all.

455
00:36:52,386 --> 00:36:55,212
Sleep deprivation, malnutrition,

456
00:36:55,532 --> 00:36:57,319
and overexertion to boot.

457
00:36:59,132 --> 00:37:00,830
Don't mind about my business.

458
00:37:00,924 --> 00:37:02,749
If you don't want me to,

459
00:37:02,879 --> 00:37:06,722
then you shouldn't have given me
the chance by making such mistakes.

460
00:37:07,903 --> 00:37:13,099
Shouldn't you have a happy
married life with Lee Gangmo?

461
00:37:14,748 --> 00:37:20,839
But you look even more tired and
unhappy than you've ever been before.

462
00:37:21,796 --> 00:37:24,041
You're mistaken.

463
00:37:24,453 --> 00:37:27,749
I've never been so happy.

464
00:37:30,316 --> 00:37:34,578
Don't come to work tomorrow,
and rest at home.

465
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:03,583
Gangmo.

466
00:38:04,716 --> 00:38:07,647
You haven't changed, right?

467
00:38:09,224 --> 00:38:15,936
When we meet again, you'll smile
for me like you always did, right?

468
00:38:19,487 --> 00:38:22,530
Gangmo...

469
00:38:41,663 --> 00:38:43,009
What?!

470
00:38:43,445 --> 00:38:45,695
He failed?!

471
00:38:46,083 --> 00:38:50,545
It's probably going to be hard 
while he's in prison.

472
00:38:52,749 --> 00:38:53,877
What do we do now?

473
00:38:54,042 --> 00:38:59,062
We can't let him keep
that land for himself.

474
00:38:59,703 --> 00:39:02,603
Ahh... Park Sotae, that useless fool.

475
00:39:02,957 --> 00:39:09,044
Considering the situation,
we'll have to use our last card.

476
00:39:11,727 --> 00:39:15,665
You're telling me there's
another way to get rid of him?

477
00:39:17,225 --> 00:39:18,644
What is it? Uh?

478
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:20,422
Tell me!

479
00:39:20,763 --> 00:39:24,567
I'm dying of curiosity here!
What is it?

480
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:31,722
Ahh... Minwoo, you'll have to
help your father's campaign.

481
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,595
Yes... I'll soon 
join his campaign camp.

482
00:39:34,713 --> 00:39:36,114
- Right...
- By the way,

483
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:39,268
it seemed like you've been 
wanting to tell me something?

484
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,987
Was I mistaken?

485
00:39:43,154 --> 00:39:46,509
Mom, can you leave us 
alone a moment?

486
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:50,981
What could it be,
if you can't even tell me?

487
00:39:51,167 --> 00:39:53,063
Have a nice day.

488
00:39:57,764 --> 00:39:59,904
I have a favor to ask you.

489
00:40:00,163 --> 00:40:04,126
Is it because of the Gaepo mudflats?

490
00:40:04,314 --> 00:40:05,068
Yes.

491
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:07,034
Guess Lee Gangmo 
must be in your way?

492
00:40:07,211 --> 00:40:09,177
We tried all sorts of things,

493
00:40:09,318 --> 00:40:11,414
but to no avail whatsoever.

494
00:40:11,991 --> 00:40:14,734
Spare some time later this evening.

495
00:40:14,852 --> 00:40:17,468
We need to go somewhere together.

496
00:40:23,524 --> 00:40:24,379
How about it?

497
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:26,440
You can do that for me, can't you?

498
00:40:26,581 --> 00:40:28,642
If we're dealing 
with such despicable scum,

499
00:40:28,689 --> 00:40:31,748
it's only natural he'll need to be
reeducated, for the good of our society.

500
00:40:31,984 --> 00:40:33,102
Thanks.

501
00:40:33,244 --> 00:40:35,375
We're in full election campaign, 
so I'm a little busy.

502
00:40:35,469 --> 00:40:37,270
Once the campaign is over,
I'll treat you for real.

503
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:38,872
Don't mention it, Seonbaenim.

504
00:40:39,013 --> 00:40:41,038
We were struggling 
to reach our quota as it is,

505
00:40:41,156 --> 00:40:44,221
so I should be thankful,
on the contrary.

506
00:40:45,002 --> 00:40:47,644
- Here... Have a drink.
- Yes.

507
00:41:13,634 --> 00:41:15,435
How did it go?

508
00:41:18,967 --> 00:41:20,239
Any good news?

509
00:41:20,392 --> 00:41:22,441
Not just Lee Gangmo,

510
00:41:22,637 --> 00:41:25,910
but we'll be able to deal
with Park Sotae as well.

511
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:33,799
But, if they're sent there, 
is it true they'll never come out alive?

512
00:41:33,928 --> 00:41:36,226
Whatever you're imagining,

513
00:41:36,544 --> 00:41:38,864
it's much, much worse.

514
00:41:39,064 --> 00:41:40,912
Is it that bad?

515
00:41:41,689 --> 00:41:45,587
We can forget Lee Gangmo for good.

516
00:41:52,224 --> 00:41:53,590
Is Seongmo doing well?

517
00:41:53,684 --> 00:41:58,099
Yeah... Seems like he can't 
find the time to visit you often.

518
00:41:58,523 --> 00:42:03,449
Right... Big Oppa gave me some money, 
so I bought you a few things.

519
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:06,498
So your preparations to
become a singer are going well?

520
00:42:06,816 --> 00:42:07,581
Uh?

521
00:42:07,676 --> 00:42:10,448
You said you might debut soon.

522
00:42:10,855 --> 00:42:11,867
Yeah...

523
00:42:12,291 --> 00:42:13,880
It's going well.

524
00:42:15,046 --> 00:42:16,289
I'm sorry, Miju.

525
00:42:16,466 --> 00:42:18,126
Why?

526
00:42:19,651 --> 00:42:22,211
I should be taking care of you,

527
00:42:22,541 --> 00:42:25,143
but you're the one 
who's looking after me.

528
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:29,135
If you're really sorry, worry about 
coming out safe and in good health.

529
00:42:29,253 --> 00:42:31,395
Then, I'll forgive you everything.

530
00:42:34,312 --> 00:42:36,029
<i>It's time.</i>

531
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:40,214
Miju.

532
00:42:40,435 --> 00:42:44,410
You know what I told you 
to keep last time?

533
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:46,287
That land deed?

534
00:42:46,381 --> 00:42:48,076
Right...

535
00:42:48,536 --> 00:42:50,596
That's really important,

536
00:42:50,702 --> 00:42:53,437
so don't keep it,
just give it to Seongmo.

537
00:42:53,614 --> 00:42:54,803
All right, Oppa.

538
00:42:54,944 --> 00:42:56,357
Don't worry.

539
00:42:56,498 --> 00:43:00,843
All right.
I'll have to go back in.

540
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:03,828
Just come once a month, 
from now on.

541
00:43:03,957 --> 00:43:05,488
Got it?

542
00:43:05,618 --> 00:43:06,807
Oppa...

543
00:43:07,019 --> 00:43:10,209
Take good care of yourself 
and don't skip meals.

544
00:43:10,678 --> 00:43:11,987
What am I, a child?

545
00:43:12,164 --> 00:43:16,346
I had a strange dream last night,
a really upsetting one.

546
00:43:16,449 --> 00:43:17,415
You silly.

547
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:19,324
It's just a nightmare.

548
00:43:19,433 --> 00:43:21,353
Careful on your way back.

549
00:43:33,779 --> 00:43:36,816
Lee Gangmo, Park Sotae.
Follow us.

550
00:43:39,348 --> 00:43:41,808
I'm still not done eating?

551
00:43:41,943 --> 00:43:45,031
There's no time,
so stop eating and just come.

552
00:44:01,724 --> 00:44:02,751
Wait for me.

553
00:44:02,833 --> 00:44:04,599
- Hurry up.
- Yes, coming.

554
00:44:04,705 --> 00:44:07,567
You pricks...
Finally letting me out, I see?

555
00:44:09,592 --> 00:44:12,128
You'll come with me as well.

556
00:44:13,898 --> 00:44:15,464
Wait a moment.

557
00:44:17,019 --> 00:44:18,714
Why him?

558
00:44:18,902 --> 00:44:21,292
He still had a long time 
to spend here?!

559
00:44:21,563 --> 00:44:22,823
There's no time.

560
00:44:22,952 --> 00:44:25,042
Yes, sure...

561
00:44:32,078 --> 00:44:35,163
Where are you taking us?

562
00:44:36,830 --> 00:44:40,649
Listen, I can understand taking me,

563
00:44:40,825 --> 00:44:44,004
but doesn't Gangmo
still have a long time left?

564
00:44:53,454 --> 00:44:56,774
What are you sending me there for?

565
00:45:00,095 --> 00:45:04,763
You've been fined twice 
for violating curfew.

566
00:45:04,975 --> 00:45:07,706
And how many years ago was that?

567
00:45:07,824 --> 00:45:10,439
Two previous convictions, rank B.

568
00:45:10,732 --> 00:45:12,545
<i>Convictions?!</i>

569
00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:16,631
<i>That's a long record, isn't it?</i>

570
00:45:16,849 --> 00:45:17,568
What?

571
00:45:17,685 --> 00:45:19,522
<i>Rank B.</i>

572
00:45:24,302 --> 00:45:26,021
Rank B.

573
00:45:28,435 --> 00:45:30,460
What are you doing?

574
00:45:31,223 --> 00:45:33,153
Seal it.

575
00:45:33,895 --> 00:45:35,343
I asked you something!

576
00:45:35,414 --> 00:45:36,826
Let go!

577
00:45:36,921 --> 00:45:39,087
<i>Let me go!</i>

578
00:45:55,337 --> 00:45:58,622
Where the hell are they taking us?

579
00:45:58,857 --> 00:46:01,730
<i>If you're releasing us,
Seoul Station would do.</i>

580
00:46:02,107 --> 00:46:05,887
But you're more childish 
than I thought?!

581
00:46:07,358 --> 00:46:10,502
You call these drawings?

582
00:46:10,631 --> 00:46:13,068
<i>I could do better with my feet.</i>

583
00:46:15,478 --> 00:46:19,167
Looking at you, people will think 
I stole some land deed from you.

584
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:32,096
<i>- Will you marry me? -</i>

585
00:47:27,528 --> 00:47:35,955
<i>{\a6}~ Samcheong Re-education Camp ~</i>

585
00:47:27,528 --> 00:47:35,955
<i>Created by the Jeon Duhwan junta in 1980 
for gangsters and political dissidents</i>

586
00:47:45,645 --> 00:47:48,070
<i>I have a question!</i>

587
00:47:49,687 --> 00:47:53,519
I was one of the 
very first ROK Marines!

588
00:47:56,827 --> 00:48:00,552
How long has it been since I
completed civil defense, what is this...

589
00:48:06,033 --> 00:48:09,512
Starting now, 
we'll cleanse you human trash.

590
00:48:09,689 --> 00:48:11,596
Proceed!

591
00:48:48,277 --> 00:48:50,538
<i>You bastards...</i>

592
00:49:08,016 --> 00:49:10,348
<i>- The will to start anew
through educative purification -</i>

593
00:49:15,799 --> 00:49:18,740
How did you end up here?

594
00:49:19,776 --> 00:49:22,013
I wrote this article,

595
00:49:23,188 --> 00:49:25,180
about what happened in Gwangju.

596
00:49:26,063 --> 00:49:30,361
<i>About the military opening fire
on the people of their own country,</i>

597
00:49:30,679 --> 00:49:33,299
shooting and hacking them to death.

598
00:49:34,064 --> 00:49:37,090
And not content with that,
they captured innocent people, and...

599
00:49:37,326 --> 00:49:40,069
<i>What's the point...</i>

600
00:49:40,411 --> 00:49:42,730
Want to get another beating?

601
00:49:49,586 --> 00:49:51,240
But, Gangmo.

602
00:49:51,594 --> 00:49:54,749
I thought you were in prison.

603
00:49:54,973 --> 00:49:57,962
How did you end up in here?

604
00:49:59,034 --> 00:50:05,203
It's likely that Jo Minwoo's
father sent me here.

605
00:50:05,627 --> 00:50:07,582
Minwoo's father?

606
00:50:08,147 --> 00:50:12,055
Former KCIA Jo Pilyeon?

607
00:50:13,308 --> 00:50:14,692
And why would he?

608
00:50:14,798 --> 00:50:17,365
There is something he wants from me.

609
00:50:19,637 --> 00:50:24,192
But I'll never let anyone steal that.

610
00:50:24,887 --> 00:50:27,771
I'm not letting anyone take
anything away from me anymore.

611
00:50:29,538 --> 00:50:32,010
I'll survive this place,

612
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:35,601
and get back everything that is mine.

613
00:50:37,110 --> 00:50:39,276
<i>To Candidate Jo Pilyeon!</i>

614
00:50:39,429 --> 00:50:41,392
Cheers!

615
00:50:48,130 --> 00:50:49,579
Thank you.

616
00:50:49,732 --> 00:50:56,679
If I win the elections, I won't forget
the hospitality you've shown me.

617
00:50:58,444 --> 00:51:02,374
But Min Honggi seems to have
quite the solid approval rate,

618
00:51:02,637 --> 00:51:04,422
will it be all right?

619
00:51:04,527 --> 00:51:06,110
Min Honggi has no money.

620
00:51:06,239 --> 00:51:10,396
If we take this to the end,
I'm confident I can win.

621
00:51:17,029 --> 00:51:20,267
Baekpa and Congressman
Oh Byeongtak are next door.

622
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:21,645
Is that so?

623
00:51:21,921 --> 00:51:26,346
Since we're here, 
should I pay them my respects?

624
00:51:26,533 --> 00:51:28,215
That's not the problem.

625
00:51:28,415 --> 00:51:31,393
Min Honggi just joined them.

626
00:51:31,581 --> 00:51:33,877
What? Min Honggi?!

627
00:51:35,113 --> 00:51:37,350
Are you telling me Min Honggi 
is meeting with Baekpa?

628
00:51:37,433 --> 00:51:41,083
If he's meeting with Baekpa, this...

629
00:51:46,288 --> 00:51:47,961
You needn't worry.

630
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:50,069
We don't need to worry?!

631
00:51:50,422 --> 00:51:52,859
If Min ever gets 
Baekpa's financial support,

632
00:51:52,953 --> 00:51:56,061
it's a fight we will never win.

633
00:51:56,190 --> 00:51:59,534
We would have spent money
in vain, don't you think?

634
00:51:59,663 --> 00:52:02,795
I've already met Baekpa.

635
00:52:02,913 --> 00:52:06,692
Turns out he's not interested
in politics whatsoever.

636
00:52:06,916 --> 00:52:10,655
<i>There's no way he'd help Min Honggi.</i>

637
00:52:11,586 --> 00:52:13,049
I apologize for 
introducing myself so late.

638
00:52:13,190 --> 00:52:15,133
I'm Min Honggi.

639
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:17,064
You must be busy,

640
00:52:17,158 --> 00:52:19,830
why not spend that time
to meet with your electors?

641
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:23,198
I invited him.
Here... Have a seat.

642
00:52:24,423 --> 00:52:26,200
<i>Listen, Commissioner Han.</i>

643
00:52:26,306 --> 00:52:31,634
You know what Baekpa tends to focus 
on as collateral for his dealings?

644
00:52:32,352 --> 00:52:37,409
What can I say...
Wouldn't it be land, after all?

645
00:52:37,538 --> 00:52:38,880
Wrong.

646
00:52:39,034 --> 00:52:40,211
It's people.

647
00:52:40,317 --> 00:52:43,696
He lends money 
with people as collateral.

648
00:52:43,849 --> 00:52:46,251
No need to lose ourselves 
in empty chatter.

649
00:52:47,228 --> 00:52:49,549
You want me to fund your campaign?

650
00:52:49,690 --> 00:52:54,447
Jo Pilyeon is using money
to influence this election.

651
00:52:54,789 --> 00:53:01,182
If you could only watch my back,
these elections are as good as done.

652
00:53:01,429 --> 00:53:03,488
<i>Give me your help, Sir.</i>

653
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:09,823
I'll respond on his behalf,
if you don't mind.

654
00:53:10,852 --> 00:53:13,579
We don't get involved
in campaign funding.

655
00:53:13,767 --> 00:53:15,181
Ohh Ohh... Madam Yoon.

656
00:53:15,285 --> 00:53:19,740
We neither accept nor use
any money coming from politics.

657
00:53:19,919 --> 00:53:21,209
That's his ironclad rule.

658
00:53:21,294 --> 00:53:23,121
<i>It used to be.</i>

659
00:53:23,528 --> 00:53:27,361
But I believe things might be 
a little different, this time.

660
00:53:29,170 --> 00:53:31,506
What are you trying to say?

661
00:53:32,645 --> 00:53:37,403
If it's not Congressman Min Honggi,
but just Min Honggi the man,

662
00:53:37,817 --> 00:53:40,417
then there's no reason 
why I shouldn't help him out.

663
00:53:40,794 --> 00:53:42,433
Sir...

664
00:53:42,875 --> 00:53:47,229
Look...
I told you things were different.

665
00:53:48,791 --> 00:53:50,497
Thank you.

666
00:53:50,886 --> 00:53:53,539
Not as a congressman,
but as Min Honggi the man,

667
00:53:53,643 --> 00:53:56,267
I will serve you to
the best of my abilities.

668
00:54:08,024 --> 00:54:10,492
And when Jo Pilyeon
asked for your support,

669
00:54:10,634 --> 00:54:12,527
you refused right off the bat.

670
00:54:12,621 --> 00:54:14,232
I guess I'll have a 
cup of tea before I leave.

671
00:54:14,298 --> 00:54:18,463
I really don't understand
what you're trying to do.

672
00:54:19,459 --> 00:54:23,688
Do you really believe Min Honggi
is any better than Jo Pilyeon?

673
00:54:24,517 --> 00:54:28,200
In all peace and tranquility,
raising a tiger is what you need.

674
00:54:28,426 --> 00:54:31,064
But raising foxes is more
suited to turbulent times.

675
00:54:32,062 --> 00:54:37,158
Now is no time 
to raise tigers, but foxes.

676
00:54:37,542 --> 00:54:39,661
So Jo Pilyeon would be the tiger,

677
00:54:40,282 --> 00:54:42,647
and Min Honggi the fox, 
by any chance?

678
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:49,810
<i>{\a6}- Candidate No. 4 Jo Pilyeon -</i>

678
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:49,810
<i>"It's no longer about parties, but people! 
The people's choice, Jo Pilyeon"</i>

679
00:54:58,125 --> 00:55:00,006
I found him, Seonbaenim.

680
00:55:00,919 --> 00:55:05,252
I found someone who can prove that
Jo Pilyeon's father was a collaborator.

681
00:55:05,384 --> 00:55:07,400
Good job.

682
00:55:08,337 --> 00:55:12,691
But... He's got quite
the few issues himself.

683
00:55:31,509 --> 00:55:33,388
This should more than suffice.

684
00:55:33,518 --> 00:55:35,072
Will you help us out?

685
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:36,901
Of course!

686
00:55:37,007 --> 00:55:41,604
I can't let the son of a pro-Japanese
collaborator become congressman.

687
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:44,472
I'll testify for you.

688
00:55:44,601 --> 00:55:46,120
Thank you.

689
00:55:46,473 --> 00:55:49,637
But there is a little problem.

690
00:55:49,749 --> 00:55:50,905
What?

691
00:55:51,364 --> 00:55:53,880
You have a previous conviction.

692
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:59,582
Still... My father was
an independence activist.

693
00:55:59,688 --> 00:56:01,160
Uh? Aigoo... Really...

694
00:56:01,266 --> 00:56:03,864
What the hell is 
happening to this country...

695
00:56:04,394 --> 00:56:06,141
I understand.

696
00:56:06,541 --> 00:56:11,616
However, if you reveal Jo Pilyeon's
past to the press firsthand,

697
00:56:11,757 --> 00:56:14,297
because of your past conviction,
there's a good chance...

698
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:16,271
they'd just bury it as perjury.

699
00:56:16,846 --> 00:56:18,010
Perjury?!

700
00:56:18,113 --> 00:56:20,856
Even with all this evidence
and someone willing to testify?

701
00:56:20,912 --> 00:56:24,799
Jo Pilyeon is more than capable
of turning all that against you.

702
00:56:25,551 --> 00:56:28,108
Then... What can we do?

703
00:56:28,730 --> 00:56:30,064
Do as I say.

704
00:56:30,177 --> 00:56:31,025
Yes.

705
00:56:37,129 --> 00:56:44,631
So that nobody in the world will know.

706
00:56:46,298 --> 00:56:52,503
The blooming love buried
deep down in my heart.

707
00:56:52,569 --> 00:57:01,200
More colorful than red roses,
is the innocence of a nineteen-year-old.

708
00:57:02,594 --> 00:57:07,048
You sure never give up, isn't it?
Not missing a single day.

709
00:57:17,522 --> 00:57:18,691
Listen.

710
00:57:18,851 --> 00:57:21,731
About withdrawing the lawsuit...

711
00:57:21,978 --> 00:57:23,308
<i>Should I do that for you?</i>

712
00:57:23,438 --> 00:57:24,768
Can you?

713
00:57:24,874 --> 00:57:27,137
I've heard you're 
not the one in charge.

714
00:57:27,347 --> 00:57:29,654
Ahh... Really, 
what does she take me for?

715
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:33,346
<i>Tell me, between a salaried chief 
and the chairman's son,</i>

716
00:57:33,428 --> 00:57:36,341
who do you think has more power?

717
00:57:36,690 --> 00:57:37,914
That's obv...

718
00:57:38,067 --> 00:57:38,985
Let's go.

719
00:57:39,091 --> 00:57:40,469
Where?

720
00:57:40,646 --> 00:57:42,262
Let's get you some
new clothes, for starters.

721
00:57:42,415 --> 00:57:45,488
How can you go out with me 
dressed like that?

722
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:48,059
Go out where?

723
00:57:48,385 --> 00:57:50,504
The department store.

724
00:57:50,622 --> 00:57:55,468
<i>Anyhow, if you do what I say today, 
I'll withdraw the lawsuit.</i>

725
00:57:55,744 --> 00:57:58,232
- Really?
- Sure!

726
00:57:58,349 --> 00:58:01,925
I'll go get the car,
so wait a moment.

727
00:58:06,991 --> 00:58:08,852
<i>Found it.</i>

728
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:18,169
Do you know how much hard work 
it takes to earn this token?

729
00:58:23,364 --> 00:58:25,808
Hurry up... Here.

730
00:58:25,951 --> 00:58:28,438
All right! Let's go.

731
00:58:35,673 --> 00:58:36,957
Come.

732
00:58:39,147 --> 00:58:40,748
Hurry up.

733
00:58:41,502 --> 00:58:42,891
Yes.

734
00:58:46,035 --> 00:58:48,378
Just leave it there.

735
00:58:53,753 --> 00:58:54,966
What are you doing?

736
00:58:55,095 --> 00:58:56,896
Hey... Minwoo!

737
00:58:58,356 --> 00:59:00,570
What's wrong with you?

738
00:59:01,241 --> 00:59:02,447
Hey... Jo Minwoo.

739
00:59:02,612 --> 00:59:05,331
What do you think you're doing?
You!

740
00:59:19,358 --> 00:59:20,618
You little...

741
00:59:20,771 --> 00:59:22,631
Now that he broke up with Jeongyeon,

742
00:59:22,796 --> 00:59:25,080
is his old habit 
coming back to haunt him?

743
00:59:25,245 --> 00:59:27,847
Still, I set my eyes on her first,

744
00:59:27,929 --> 00:59:31,625
that little prick...

745
00:59:35,714 --> 00:59:37,912
Where are we going?

746
00:59:38,701 --> 00:59:40,208
Aren't you listening?

747
00:59:40,349 --> 00:59:43,013
Where are you taking me?

748
00:59:49,684 --> 00:59:55,965
Starting from now, you will 
have no social status whatsoever.

749
00:59:56,236 --> 00:59:58,343
The Samcheong purification camp...

750
00:59:58,508 --> 01:00:02,947
begins with accepting your sins 
and reflecting upon them.

751
01:00:07,845 --> 01:00:09,312
You.

752
01:00:09,806 --> 01:00:10,571
Yes, Sir!

753
01:00:10,689 --> 01:00:11,877
Your offense.

754
01:00:12,114 --> 01:00:13,856
Assault, Sir!

755
01:00:15,010 --> 01:00:15,846
You.

756
01:00:16,129 --> 01:00:17,012
Yes, Sir.

757
01:00:17,141 --> 01:00:18,790
Hit and run, Sir.

758
01:00:19,367 --> 01:00:20,745
You.

759
01:00:22,064 --> 01:00:24,136
Yes, Sir! I...

760
01:00:25,914 --> 01:00:27,468
Did they take you here for no reason?

761
01:00:27,550 --> 01:00:28,916
No, Sir!

762
01:00:29,034 --> 01:00:33,669
I was the worst thug you could meet!

763
01:00:36,334 --> 01:00:37,512
You.

764
01:00:39,284 --> 01:00:41,032
Your offense.

765
01:00:52,817 --> 01:00:59,046
Why? Is it hard to admit 
you killed a man?

766
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:02,412
I...

767
01:01:04,154 --> 01:01:05,626
am not a killer.

768
01:01:05,803 --> 01:01:09,452
Then, if you're not a killer, 
what are you?

769
01:01:12,277 --> 01:01:17,036
I fell in love with a woman I
should have never even glanced at.

770
01:01:18,732 --> 01:01:20,309
If I committed any crime,

771
01:01:20,533 --> 01:01:22,405
that is the only one.

772
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:24,972
Loving the wrong woman.

773
01:01:41,510 --> 01:01:43,259
Stop.

774
01:01:45,331 --> 01:01:46,815
<i>Listen well.</i>

775
01:01:47,156 --> 01:01:49,111
<i>You are no longer people.</i>

776
01:01:49,335 --> 01:01:51,595
<i>You're nothing but criminals.</i>

777
01:01:53,571 --> 01:01:55,373
Repeat after me.

778
01:01:55,479 --> 01:01:58,788
I will follow any and all orders.

779
01:01:58,952 --> 01:02:02,826
I will follow any and all orders.

780
01:02:06,190 --> 01:02:12,463
Focus.
Discipline.

781
01:02:12,822 --> 01:02:15,986
Focus.
Discipline.

782
01:02:16,092 --> 01:02:22,340
I refrain from reading newspapers,
listening to the radio or watching TV.

783
01:02:30,486 --> 01:02:36,142
<i>I humbly respect our public institutions,
and refrain from smoking and drinking.</i>

784
01:02:40,955 --> 01:02:43,463
A little more, please.

785
01:02:44,005 --> 01:02:45,359
<i>Away, you prick!</i>

786
01:02:45,441 --> 01:02:49,018
<i>I eat what is given to me.</i>

787
01:02:52,651 --> 01:02:55,571
<i>Five seconds left to eat.</i>

788
01:02:55,854 --> 01:02:59,810
<i>Four... Three... Two... One!</i>

789
01:02:59,916 --> 01:03:02,256
<i>Proceed!</i>

790
01:03:14,486 --> 01:03:18,543
<i>I accept any punishment
that is given to me.</i>

791
01:03:31,611 --> 01:03:32,776
<i>Fine...</i>

792
01:03:32,941 --> 01:03:35,155
<i>Hit me all you want.</i>

793
01:03:35,814 --> 01:03:38,416
<i>I will not run away from...</i>

794
01:03:38,522 --> 01:03:41,242
<i>all the suffering
you're putting me through.</i>

795
01:03:41,704 --> 01:03:46,049
<i>And I will never forget it.</i>

796
01:03:46,402 --> 01:03:49,628
<i>As the payback which awaits you...</i>

797
01:03:49,805 --> 01:03:51,112
<i>will be a hundred,</i>

798
01:03:51,241 --> 01:03:53,535
<i>a thousand times worse.</i>

799
01:03:59,917 --> 01:04:01,774
<i>Seongmo is here.</i>

800
01:04:03,441 --> 01:04:05,051
Send him in.

801
01:04:11,322 --> 01:04:12,801
<i>Have a seat.</i>

802
01:04:17,451 --> 01:04:19,271
Have a drink.

803
01:04:27,364 --> 01:04:31,733
I have a favor to ask you.

804
01:04:32,192 --> 01:04:33,522
A favor?

805
01:04:33,637 --> 01:04:35,804
Just give me any order.

806
01:04:36,275 --> 01:04:38,535
That Lee Gangmo you captured.

807
01:04:38,665 --> 01:04:42,216
He's at the Samcheong 
Camp as we speak.

808
01:04:44,552 --> 01:04:47,399
I made it possible.

809
01:04:48,814 --> 01:04:52,144
He's got land.

810
01:04:54,133 --> 01:04:59,861
That is land he can never possess.

811
01:05:00,994 --> 01:05:03,255
What are you trying to tell me?

812
01:05:05,292 --> 01:05:07,482
Get rid of Lee Gangmo.

813
01:05:09,283 --> 01:05:11,014
<i>Kill him.</i>

814
01:05:11,191 --> 01:05:13,979
Do it quietly, without
attracting anyone's attention.

01:05:37,389 --> 01:05:42,312
This is a human slaughterhouse,
where undiscriminating violence reigns.

822
01:05:42,454 --> 01:05:48,329
My God...
A woman you couldn't love?

823
01:05:48,588 --> 01:05:51,378
<i>Look at me?
Don't I still love her?</i>

824
01:05:51,531 --> 01:05:53,007
I asked to break off the engagement.

825
01:05:53,090 --> 01:05:56,328
<i>Because I thought I could never
endure married life without love.</i>

826
01:05:56,492 --> 01:05:58,541
Just hang in there for thirty seconds.

827
01:05:58,659 --> 01:06:02,321
<i>When you're struggling and someone 
holds your hands, you gain strength.</i>

828
01:06:02,474 --> 01:06:05,691
What are you trying to scheme?

829
01:06:05,797 --> 01:06:07,822
I could tell you,
but then I'd have to kill you.

830
01:06:08,022 --> 01:06:12,249
<i>523. From this moment on, 
you'll become 534.</i>

831
01:06:12,414 --> 01:06:14,143
<i>Yes.</i>
