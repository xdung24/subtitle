<i>Congratulations on winning the GBA!</i>

00:02:58,529 --> 00:03:02,664
<i>Can you comment on your feelings?</i>

25
00:03:07,524 --> 00:03:14,675
I merely gave my best to build
strong and reliable buildings.

26
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,252
And with that, I wish you a safe return.

27
00:03:23,649 --> 00:03:26,054
Mister Chairman, just one more comment!

28
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:35,633
Mister Chairman.

29
00:03:37,253 --> 00:03:42,872
We've been informed that Jo Pilyeon
escaped from the mental institution.

30
00:03:43,588 --> 00:03:46,539
<i>Ehh... Stubborn old fart.</i>

31
00:03:46,955 --> 00:03:50,046
As if he had that long to live...

32
00:03:51,996 --> 00:03:57,219
He's not going to come
looking for you, is he?

33
00:03:58,783 --> 00:04:03,167
Send home all employees 
left in the building.

34
00:04:03,382 --> 00:04:05,081
What?

35
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,184
It's been a long time.

36
00:05:03,724 --> 00:05:06,081
Care for a drink?

37
00:05:08,448 --> 00:05:13,015
Did you believe my downfall 
would come so easily?

38
00:05:13,248 --> 00:05:15,098
<i>I'm Jo Pilyeon!</i>

39
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,354
I'm not dead yet!

40
00:05:18,114 --> 00:05:19,502
That...

41
00:05:19,765 --> 00:05:22,234
That land they call Gangnam...

42
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:24,937
It is my creation.

43
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:26,779
I, Jo Pilyeon!

44
00:05:26,896 --> 00:05:34,245
I sacrificed my own blood and tears
for the sake of our country's development.

45
00:05:34,624 --> 00:05:40,397
And you stole all that from me.

46
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:44,850
You stole all my
achievements of a lifetime,

47
00:05:45,099 --> 00:05:47,027
and the world I created!

48
00:05:47,173 --> 00:05:49,438
If it weren't for you,

49
00:05:49,914 --> 00:05:52,974
this city would have been
a much better place to live in.

50
00:05:53,105 --> 00:05:54,128
What?

51
00:05:54,391 --> 00:05:57,167
You people ruined it all.

52
00:05:57,489 --> 00:06:00,791
While constantly yapping about
development and growth,

53
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:04,765
greed has blinded you all.

54
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:06,665
Shut your mouth!

55
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:13,123
You can act superior all you want,
but a bullet is all it'll take to silence you.

56
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:17,644
Kneel down and beg for survival.

57
00:06:20,591 --> 00:06:26,879
I should have given your father 
a chance to beg as well.

58
00:06:27,551 --> 00:06:31,982
<i>Had he begged me on that day,</i>

59
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:35,737
I might have even spared him.

60
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:41,523
<i>But it was all over in one shot,</i>

61
00:06:41,698 --> 00:06:47,137
blood spurting out of his chest.

62
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:56,529
<i>You should have seen him.</i>

63
00:06:58,343 --> 00:07:00,272
Fine...

64
00:07:00,622 --> 00:07:02,639
Go ahead and kill me.

65
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:04,614
<i>Do it!</i>

66
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:11,631
A finger is all it will take to make the man 
who killed your father taste payback.

67
00:07:12,831 --> 00:07:15,067
Pull that trigger.

68
00:07:15,255 --> 00:07:17,039
Do it!

69
00:07:22,168 --> 00:07:27,749
You can't kill me.

70
00:07:28,182 --> 00:07:30,715
<i>You don't have the courage to do so.</i>

71
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:37,326
Murder is not for anyone.

72
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:44,441
If you have the guts,
go ahead and shoot me.

73
00:07:44,646 --> 00:07:47,714
Shouldn't you avenge your father?

74
00:07:48,138 --> 00:07:49,789
<i>Come on.</i>

75
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,294
Go ahead.

76
00:07:51,425 --> 00:07:53,648
Do it!

77
00:08:32,973 --> 00:08:38,050
And you want me to stain my hands 
with that dirty blood of yours?

78
00:08:38,995 --> 00:08:41,622
If you desire to die that much,

79
00:08:41,913 --> 00:08:44,579
go ahead and jump off.

80
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:45,845
What?

81
00:08:46,006 --> 00:08:49,337
If the city you always dreamed of 
becomes your burial ground,

82
00:08:50,184 --> 00:08:52,770
I'm sure you'll have nothing 
to complain about.

83
00:09:00,422 --> 00:09:02,289
Keep this in mind.

84
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:05,676
All the wicked sins
you people have committed...

85
00:09:06,554 --> 00:09:11,219
will forever be remembered by that city.

86
00:09:11,314 --> 00:09:14,965
You bastard...

87
00:09:22,783 --> 00:09:25,899
You bastard!

Hyung... Hyung.

97
00:10:19,227 --> 00:10:21,883
Hyung, I didn't touch your piggy bank.

98
00:10:22,001 --> 00:10:23,273
I swear.

99
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:25,380
Everyone knows you stole it.

100
00:10:25,469 --> 00:10:27,717
- You little...
- Why are you hitting me?

101
00:10:27,849 --> 00:10:30,695
Miju and I had been saving that money 
to buy a birthday present for Mom.

102
00:10:30,789 --> 00:10:31,726
Give it back.

103

Give it back!

Ahh... I said it wasn't me!

105
00:10:41,927 --> 00:10:42,789
All right.

106

Awww... You're so nasty.

Gangmo.

112
00:10:58,675 --> 00:11:01,344
What did you do this time, 
getting scolded again?

113
00:11:01,439 --> 00:11:05,439
Mommy, Mommy...
Little Oppa took the piggy bank, and...

114

Gangmo.

115
00:11:07,685 --> 00:11:09,431
Where are you going, again?

116
00:11:49,547 --> 00:11:50,631
It's cold.

117
00:11:50,716 --> 00:11:52,816

<i>Right, that's that.</i>

122
00:12:04,393 --> 00:12:07,602
But you're sure the gold bars
are coming in this weekend, right?

123
00:12:07,709 --> 00:12:09,837
Stop worrying.

124
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:14,604
When we're done with this, 
no more smuggling.

125

<i>- It's all done.
- Good job.</i>

126
00:12:25,408 --> 00:12:27,456
Bring these supplies 
to the army base, and come back.

127
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:29,236
Yes, certainly.

128
00:12:30,456 --> 00:12:31,644
Ahh... Right.

129
00:12:31,795 --> 00:12:34,670
You know that we have more supplies 
coming this weekend, right?

130
00:12:34,762 --> 00:12:36,703
We're counting on you for that.

131
00:12:36,816 --> 00:12:39,447
Aigoo... No need to mention it.

132
00:12:53,495 --> 00:12:55,479
- Dad.
- Ahh... What the hell...

133
00:12:55,589 --> 00:12:56,856
When did you jump in?

134
00:12:56,969 --> 00:12:59,167
You little scoundrel, you came
to steal chocolate again, right?

135
00:12:59,356 --> 00:13:01,761
Those fellas from earlier on, 
they're smugglers.

136
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:03,682
What kind of nonsense
are you talking about?

137
00:13:03,775 --> 00:13:05,922
I heard it all while hiding here,

138
00:13:06,016 --> 00:13:10,768
and they talked about
smuggling gold bars this weekend.

139
00:13:22,528 --> 00:13:24,364
<i>Smuggling gold bars?</i>

140
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:28,739
<i>Are you sure they said gold bars?</i>

141
00:13:28,852 --> 00:13:29,814
Yes.

142
00:13:30,097 --> 00:13:34,092

00:13:36,635 --> 00:13:42,305
<i>We had been gathering evidence on
a smuggling ring within the base.</i>

<i>And now it's not just flour
or saccharine, but gold bars?</i>

147

Let's deal with it ourselves without
getting the police or the military involved.

<i>That's right.</i>

What did you say your name was?

150
00:13:57,048 --> 00:13:58,539
Lee Gangmo, Sir.

This is not much,
but here's your reward.

154
00:14:06,978 --> 00:14:08,747
It's all right.

155
00:14:08,834 --> 00:14:10,603
It was our duty to report that.

156
00:14:10,691 --> 00:14:12,016
No.

157
00:14:12,242 --> 00:14:13,999
With our country facing
such economic difficulties,

158
00:14:14,092 --> 00:14:16,212
what he did will really help us.

159

Here, take it.

160
00:14:19,632 --> 00:14:21,532

00:14:57,667 --> 00:15:00,176
<i>Take a look.</i>

163
00:15:00,318 --> 00:15:03,167
They sure are pretty.

164
00:15:05,721 --> 00:15:07,699
Ohh... I'm doing fine.

165
00:15:07,838 --> 00:15:08,809
How about you?

166
00:15:08,762 --> 00:15:13,328
<i>{\a6}~ Director HWANG Taeseop ~</i>

167
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:13,540
<i>Yeah, things are going fine here,
so stop worrying.</i>

168
00:15:13,633 --> 00:15:15,810
I told you to wait just a little.

169
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,643
All the land in Gangnam you bought...

170
00:15:17,738 --> 00:15:20,983
will turn into gold in no time.

171
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:22,879
Yeah...

172
00:15:23,011 --> 00:15:25,417
Okay, I'll see you around.

173
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,085
How did it go?

174
00:15:32,141 --> 00:15:34,555
The bank said they will not 
lend us any more money.

175
00:15:34,654 --> 00:15:37,008
Tell them we'll pay double 
the interest rate!

176
00:15:37,101 --> 00:15:39,672
We promised we'd foot the rest
of the bill by the end of the month.

177
00:15:39,748 --> 00:15:40,959
<i>If we keep leaning onto the bank,</i>

178
00:15:41,053 --> 00:15:44,817
we might lose all
the building lots we have.

179
00:15:48,183 --> 00:15:49,206
How did it go?

180
00:15:49,311 --> 00:15:51,419
What did Park from Wangshim-Ri say?

181
00:15:51,699 --> 00:15:52,805
Don't get me started.

182
00:15:52,928 --> 00:15:56,169
The moment I mentioned money, 
I was kicked out of the door.

183
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:58,701
And Director Choi?
Choi from Myeongdong.

184
00:15:58,843 --> 00:16:01,352
He even refuses to meet me.

185
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,895
I'll be damned.

186
00:16:05,871 --> 00:16:07,607
<i>{\a6}~ Manbo Construction ~</i>

187
00:16:11,452 --> 00:16:13,008
What are you looking at?

188
00:16:14,642 --> 00:16:17,148
There isn't a single one I like.

189
00:16:17,255 --> 00:16:18,897
You're hungry, aren't you?

190
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:20,765
What should we get?

191
00:16:28,244 --> 00:16:29,710
Let's go.

192
00:16:37,985 --> 00:16:40,371
- Four gukbap*.
- Yes.

193
00:16:37,985 --> 00:16:40,375
<i>{\a6}*boiled rice with soup</i>

194
00:16:40,456 --> 00:16:42,966
We're five, 
why are you ordering only four?

195
00:16:43,662 --> 00:16:45,333
Miju can't finish a serving by herself.

196
00:16:45,446 --> 00:16:46,838
Just ask for another bowl of rice.

197
00:16:46,924 --> 00:16:49,490
No way! I'm going to finish
one serving all by myself!

198
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:52,245
Have one with me,
I can't finish it all.

199
00:16:52,335 --> 00:16:53,911
Still, it's your birthday.

200
00:16:54,006 --> 00:16:57,781
Dad, let's go for some meat.
I want pork ribs.

201
00:16:57,905 --> 00:16:59,456
They serve beef soup here as well.

202
00:16:59,558 --> 00:17:02,647
Your belly will fill up anyway,
so just be quiet and eat.

203
00:17:06,496 --> 00:17:09,106
Mommy, happy birthday.

204
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:12,992
What is this?

205
00:17:13,701 --> 00:17:14,965
Oh my...

206
00:17:15,597 --> 00:17:17,371
<i>It's a silver ring?!</i>

207
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,607
Did you buy this?

208
00:17:19,704 --> 00:17:23,339
Not Little Oppa, just Big Oppa and me.

209
00:17:24,097 --> 00:17:27,575
My... And what money
could you possibly have?

210
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:29,264
Happy birthday, Mom.

211
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:31,000
Thanks.

212
00:17:31,245 --> 00:17:32,676
It's so pretty...

213
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:35,365
Give me that ring.

214
00:17:35,695 --> 00:17:37,092
Come on.

215
00:17:42,551 --> 00:17:45,249
This ring doesn't suit you.

216
00:17:45,409 --> 00:17:46,239
Dad...

217
00:17:46,305 --> 00:17:47,117
Daddy!

218
00:17:47,239 --> 00:17:48,494
Dad is right.

219
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,183
It's too damn corny.

220
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:52,395
You be quiet.

221
00:17:52,782 --> 00:17:54,489
Dad, we bought it for her.

222
00:17:54,584 --> 00:17:57,828
It doesn't even suit her,
why even bother wasting money?

223
00:17:57,904 --> 00:18:01,623
You're such a cheapskate.
Like that Scrooge fella.

224
00:18:01,711 --> 00:18:03,126
I told you we'd move to Seoul, right?

225
00:18:03,268 --> 00:18:05,239
So don't even think
about wasting money like that.

226
00:18:05,313 --> 00:18:07,470
Your father is right.

227
00:18:07,574 --> 00:18:10,862
<i>It'd be much better to buy a
few sacks of barley with that money.</i>

228
00:18:11,652 --> 00:18:13,966
Go get your refund.

229
00:18:14,164 --> 00:18:15,796
<i>Here's your gukbap.</i>

230
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,860
Here... I'm hungry. Let's eat!

231
00:18:19,787 --> 00:18:24,288
But, that friend of yours, Hwang Taeseop.

232
00:18:24,722 --> 00:18:25,976
Are you sure he's trustworthy?

233
00:18:26,047 --> 00:18:27,581
I told you!

234
00:18:27,713 --> 00:18:30,222
He's a friend from my hometown, 
and we found refuge together during the war.

235
00:18:30,335 --> 00:18:33,442
Why, do you trust 
all your hometown friends?

236
00:18:45,938 --> 00:18:50,041
Ehh Ehh! Did you meet today
for the first time, or something?

237
00:18:50,134 --> 00:18:52,183
Let's see some smiles, shall we?

238
00:18:52,991 --> 00:18:56,033
<i>Ehh Ehh... 
Who asked you to cry? Smile!</i>

239
00:18:56,142 --> 00:18:59,672
Hyung. Give me that hat.

240
00:19:02,311 --> 00:19:04,584
There... Nice, nice!
We're set...

241
00:19:04,671 --> 00:19:06,330
Here... I'm shooting.

242
00:19:06,613 --> 00:19:10,062
<i>1... 2... 3!</i>

243
00:19:17,811 --> 00:19:20,980
The Defense Ministry just
announced their personnel changes.

244
00:19:24,609 --> 00:19:25,952
Aren't they going too far?

245
00:19:26,051 --> 00:19:28,309
Considering results or any other criteria, 
a promotion was a no-brainer,

246
00:19:28,404 --> 00:19:30,743
but they appoint you to
Samcheok's outskirts out of the blue?

247
00:19:32,243 --> 00:19:36,271
If you end up leaving,
I'll hang up my boots.

248
00:19:37,526 --> 00:19:38,790
Jaechun.

249
00:19:39,084 --> 00:19:42,484
How about we stake our careers 
to really make it big, for once?

250
00:19:42,776 --> 00:19:43,927
What?

251
00:19:44,749 --> 00:19:46,248
If you want to succeed in this field,

252
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:47,993
you need to establish connections 
with the central agency,

253
00:19:48,135 --> 00:19:50,338
and to achieve that you need money.

254
00:19:50,433 --> 00:19:53,140
Which is why people with neither
money nor connections like us...

255
00:19:53,531 --> 00:19:58,046
are destined to play second fiddle in 
the countryside for the rest of our careers.

256
00:19:59,018 --> 00:20:01,237
But where would we find the money?

257
00:20:02,237 --> 00:20:03,704
Gold bars.

258
00:20:04,973 --> 00:20:05,992
What?

259
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:12,640
The gold bars which
are about to be smuggled.

260
00:20:12,741 --> 00:20:13,993
With that gold in our hands,

261
00:20:14,078 --> 00:20:16,735
be it the Blue House, 
the Defense Ministry or the KCIA*,

262
00:20:14,078 --> 00:20:16,735
<i>{\a6}*Korean Central Intelligence Agency</i>

263
00:20:16,823 --> 00:20:19,337
any important post could be ours.

264
00:20:22,104 --> 00:20:23,780
But, Chief...

265
00:20:24,076 --> 00:20:26,603
What if something happens?

266
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,359
Of course we can't do this firsthand.

267
00:20:33,255 --> 00:20:38,660
We need someone to get
his hands dirty on our behalf.

268
00:20:44,853 --> 00:20:47,522
I still haven't been able to.

269
00:20:48,809 --> 00:20:51,003
You want me to come down to Busan?

270
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:54,720
Because the situation here is urgent...

271
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,352
Yes.

272
00:20:59,097 --> 00:21:00,943
Yes, I understand.

273
00:21:09,461 --> 00:21:14,767
Of all people to send there,
why call me again?

274
00:21:19,961 --> 00:21:20,696
Honey.

275
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:22,395
Going somewhere?

276
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,116
Jeongyeon, you came, too?

277
00:21:25,229 --> 00:21:27,367
Dad, I came as well.

278
00:21:27,443 --> 00:21:28,757
Just sit.

279
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:30,512
Honey, come here and have some.

280
00:21:30,606 --> 00:21:33,663
They're sweet potatoes.
You can't imagine how tasty they are.

281
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:36,999
Jeongyeon.
Have one yourself.

282
00:21:40,537 --> 00:21:42,645
You said you had this friend, right?

283
00:21:42,732 --> 00:21:44,721
The wife of Dongyang Dyes' Director Hwang.

284
00:21:44,822 --> 00:21:47,473
Think she could manage
to lend me some money right away?

285
00:21:47,567 --> 00:21:50,105
Her? She got divorced last year 
after having an affair.

286
00:21:50,247 --> 00:21:51,454
Have some of this.

287
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:52,898
Here.

288
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,336
Think I have time
to eat potatoes, you brat?

289
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:57,515
Ahh... You scared me to death.

290
00:22:00,578 --> 00:22:07,326
I was just offering you some potatoes, 
why scream at me?!

291
00:22:08,062 --> 00:22:08,939
<i>Aigoo... Really!</i>

292
00:22:09,005 --> 00:22:12,073
How can a little brat
always be so hungry?

293
00:22:12,609 --> 00:22:15,302
- Jeongshik.
- Ohh, Mom.

294
00:22:16,533 --> 00:22:20,012
What's that, were you staring at me?

295
00:22:20,252 --> 00:22:22,223
Where is my mother?

296
00:22:22,723 --> 00:22:24,874
She's here, where else?

297
00:22:24,971 --> 00:22:26,874
Didn't ask for my stepmother.

298
00:22:27,157 --> 00:22:28,093
What?

299
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:29,073
Stepmother?!

300
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,642
I mean my birth mother.

301
00:22:30,746 --> 00:22:33,214
You little brat, I just ought to...

302
00:22:33,301 --> 00:22:37,838
You kicked my mother out 
and took her place.

303
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:41,653
I don't care if your mouth got all warped,
but let's speak the truth.

304
00:22:41,761 --> 00:22:43,349
I didn't kick her out,

305
00:22:43,438 --> 00:22:46,131
she just gave birth to you outside 
and you were brought in.

306
00:22:46,273 --> 00:22:48,424
<i>Mom, I want more.</i>

307
00:22:48,537 --> 00:22:51,754
Ohh... Sure.
Here you go.

308
00:22:52,443 --> 00:22:55,596
If you really want to meet your mother,
go to Daejeon and find her yourself.

309
00:22:55,705 --> 00:22:59,803
I bet after abandoning you
she'll be ecstatic to meet again.

310
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:15,097
<i>It's driving me crazy as well.</i>

311
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,218
If I don't settle my back payments 
by the end of the month...

312
00:23:18,303 --> 00:23:19,857
That doesn't concern me.

313
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:23,521
Give me my money back
and pay the penalty.

314
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:24,871
Chief...

315
00:23:24,957 --> 00:23:28,535
I invested everything I had and more,
because you gave me your word.

316
00:23:29,073 --> 00:23:32,648
Think that you can get away
with making me lose money?

317
00:23:32,809 --> 00:23:34,957
If we manage to overcome this crisis,

318
00:23:35,069 --> 00:23:39,999
you'll make ten times... no... 
a few dozen times your initial investment.

319
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:44,523
Then overcome that crisis, 
even if you have to sell your heart to do it.

320
00:23:45,878 --> 00:23:51,646
If I could only do so,
I'd sell my every organ.

321
00:23:54,271 --> 00:23:57,941
There could be one way...

322
00:24:00,837 --> 00:24:03,422
To find all that money?

323
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:05,984
<i>Go ahead and tell me.</i>

324
00:24:06,098 --> 00:24:11,105
If I can finish this construction,
I'll do everything.

325
00:24:12,649 --> 00:24:16,373
Smuggled gold bars will
soon reach the harbor here.

326
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:21,038
If we arrest those smugglers,
the bars will be seized as state property.

327
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:25,271
But if we close an eye,
then they can be ours.

328
00:24:26,168 --> 00:24:32,234
So are you suggesting
we steal those gold bars?

329
00:24:32,479 --> 00:24:34,262
It's not like...

330
00:24:35,177 --> 00:24:39,687
we'd be forced to report them.
So first come, first served, isn't it?

331
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:42,945
But... How can we?

332
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:49,121
I'll watch your back, so you do it.

333
00:24:50,527 --> 00:24:51,932
Me?!

334
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:56,366
You need to survive
through this, don't you?

335
00:24:56,603 --> 00:24:57,669
How about it?

336
00:24:57,763 --> 00:25:00,358
Want to stake your life for it?

337
00:25:03,131 --> 00:25:04,745
Is it...

338
00:25:05,905 --> 00:25:08,489
something I can do?

339
00:25:09,243 --> 00:25:10,932
In life,

340
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:15,688
there is nothing people can't do,
when they set their hearts on it.

341
00:25:44,393 --> 00:25:47,115
<i>The truck driver will 
transport the gold bars.</i>

342
00:25:47,266 --> 00:25:51,027
<i>Kill him, and seize those bars.</i>

343
00:25:54,454 --> 00:25:58,459
Must I really go this far?!

344
00:26:00,648 --> 00:26:03,811
Are you asking me to kill someone?

345
00:26:07,094 --> 00:26:10,924
Why do things always
end up so messed up?!

346
00:26:21,783 --> 00:26:22,750
Hey...

347
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,420
Taeseop.

348
00:26:25,423 --> 00:26:28,394
What brings you here so suddenly?

349
00:26:29,857 --> 00:26:31,281
It's you?

350
00:26:31,479 --> 00:26:32,995
Here...

351
00:26:33,596 --> 00:26:35,420
Have a drink.

352
00:26:36,842 --> 00:26:40,094
Is something going on?

353
00:26:40,342 --> 00:26:44,870
It's just that nothing
ever seems to go right...

354
00:26:45,673 --> 00:26:46,550
I really...

355
00:26:46,748 --> 00:26:48,258
Listen to him.

356
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:52,862
Think of how we survived 
that battlefield, will you?

357
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:55,503
Just the fact we crossed
the 38th buck naked...

358
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:58,951
and made it all the 
way here is remarkable.

359
00:27:00,093 --> 00:27:03,085
You sure could call it that.

360
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:06,210
Killing and being killed...

361
00:27:06,318 --> 00:27:08,655
That's no big deal.

362
00:27:09,023 --> 00:27:11,400
And what's that supposed to mean?

363
00:27:11,966 --> 00:27:13,494
Daesoo.

364
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:19,907
Whatever it takes, I'm going to succeed.

365
00:27:20,676 --> 00:27:23,034
Can't we just make money working like dogs,

366
00:27:23,138 --> 00:27:26,176
and spend it like kings?

367
00:27:26,996 --> 00:27:28,713
I can do it.

368
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:30,618
I, Hwang Taeseop,

369
00:27:30,795 --> 00:27:32,779
can do that.

370
00:27:34,125 --> 00:27:37,052
You trust me, don't you?

371
00:27:37,425 --> 00:27:41,592
You know that I can do anything
if I really want to,

372
00:27:41,762 --> 00:27:42,743
don't you?

373
00:27:42,847 --> 00:27:44,695
Of course!

374
00:27:44,819 --> 00:27:46,412
I don't really know what's going on,

375
00:27:46,522 --> 00:27:48,703
but if it's something
even Hwang Taeseop can't do,

376
00:27:48,825 --> 00:27:51,033
then nobody can.

377
00:27:51,382 --> 00:27:53,099
Right...

378
00:27:54,052 --> 00:27:56,165
Thanks.

379
00:27:56,381 --> 00:28:01,505
You're the only one I can count on.

380
00:28:08,949 --> 00:28:11,770
Bean curd!

381
00:28:16,892 --> 00:28:20,027
Do you really have to go at this hour?

382
00:28:20,121 --> 00:28:23,792
<i>I knew something was up last night...</i>

383
00:28:24,483 --> 00:28:27,347
Honey, have a seat.

384
00:28:41,272 --> 00:28:42,753
Thanks.

385
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:47,508
Ever since you met me,
you haven't had anything tasty,

386
00:28:47,602 --> 00:28:52,492
and had to wear shabby clothes,
but you never complained even once.

387
00:28:53,387 --> 00:28:57,774
You did all the hard work...

388
00:28:57,925 --> 00:28:59,501
Just endure it a little longer.

389
00:28:59,783 --> 00:29:01,907
Once prices of land in
Apgujeong-Dong start moving,

390
00:29:02,029 --> 00:29:04,435
we'll be able to get our own room.

391
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:08,416
We'll eat all the pork ribs we want,

392
00:29:08,576 --> 00:29:10,728
send the kids to college,

393
00:29:10,837 --> 00:29:12,772
and live a nice life.

394
00:29:16,216 --> 00:29:18,735
Ahh... How nasty...

395
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:22,276
You make people cry
right from the morning?

396
00:29:23,468 --> 00:29:25,387
<i>This must be expensive,</i>

397
00:29:25,495 --> 00:29:28,249
where did you find all that money?

398
00:29:29,732 --> 00:29:32,905
Ahh... I shouldn't tell you this.

399
00:29:33,865 --> 00:29:37,716
Actually, it was Gangmo who bought this.

400
00:29:38,131 --> 00:29:40,735
<i>Ehh... And where would
Gangmo find that money?</i>

401
00:29:40,829 --> 00:29:44,092
Because he did something to
help our economy, he was rewarded.

402
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:45,482
What are you talking about?

403
00:29:45,576 --> 00:29:47,884
Let's just leave it at that, 
I'll tell you later.

404
00:29:49,144 --> 00:29:50,596
Dad, let's go.

405
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,099
I told you to stay home.

406
00:29:52,184 --> 00:29:55,524
I heard it from Gangmo,
about you and the smugg...

407
00:29:55,889 --> 00:29:57,647
Heard what?

408
00:29:57,839 --> 00:29:59,915
It's nothing.

409
00:30:00,208 --> 00:30:01,379
We'll get going.

410
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:03,533
I'll be late.

411
00:30:04,113 --> 00:30:07,198
<i>I'll make your favorite, kimchi jjigae.</i>

412
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:08,537
<i>Since we're there,
how about a bottle of soju?</i>

413
00:30:08,622 --> 00:30:10,698
You beat me, this time.

414
00:30:12,195 --> 00:30:13,098
We'll get going.

415
00:30:13,164 --> 00:30:15,434
See you tonight.

416
00:30:20,843 --> 00:30:22,550
Aigoo...

417
00:30:26,746 --> 00:30:28,715
My belly...

418
00:30:28,964 --> 00:30:30,196
My belly...

419
00:30:30,536 --> 00:30:32,347
My belly...

420
00:31:30,393 --> 00:31:31,692
Follow us.

421
00:31:31,766 --> 00:31:33,264
Yes.

422
00:31:47,598 --> 00:31:50,856
What if they find out we
reported them and try to hurt us?

423
00:31:50,951 --> 00:31:52,243
If people were afraid of doing that much,

424
00:31:52,318 --> 00:31:55,573
then nobody would ever try 
to do the right thing.

425
00:31:56,458 --> 00:31:57,998
Seongmo.

426
00:31:58,815 --> 00:32:01,573
You're the eldest.
Uh?!

427
00:32:02,668 --> 00:32:06,661
When Dad gets old, 
you'll become the head of our family.

428
00:32:06,772 --> 00:32:09,697
And you know what's
the most important thing?

429
00:32:10,782 --> 00:32:13,141
It's courage.
Courage.

430
00:32:14,051 --> 00:32:16,338
The courage to protect your family.

431
00:32:16,489 --> 00:32:18,678
<i>To feed and support them.</i>

432
00:32:18,952 --> 00:32:21,810
<i>The courage to sacrifice for them.</i>

433
00:32:21,914 --> 00:32:25,395
You need courage to lead your family.

434
00:32:26,756 --> 00:32:29,605
Always bear that in mind, uh?

435
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,494
Yes.

436
00:32:33,292 --> 00:32:35,537
Mommy, don't die!

437
00:32:35,631 --> 00:32:38,437
Push! Do it!

438
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:43,219
Aigoo... you brat! 
You're making more noise than her! Get out.

439
00:32:43,304 --> 00:32:45,776
Water... Water.

440
00:32:45,908 --> 00:32:49,689
Aigoo... Are you out of your mind?
Go fetch some cold water.

441
00:32:49,774 --> 00:32:50,321
Cold?

442
00:32:50,397 --> 00:32:54,349
Aigoo... 
Where the hell is your father?

443
00:32:54,444 --> 00:32:58,454
<i>Push...</i>

444
00:33:32,598 --> 00:33:36,258
Move them!

445
00:33:59,838 --> 00:34:02,376
Stay inside and don't come out.

446
00:34:21,613 --> 00:34:23,056
What's this?

447
00:34:23,265 --> 00:34:23,999
Hey...

448
00:34:24,095 --> 00:34:25,339
Lee Daesoo!

449
00:34:25,513 --> 00:34:27,283
What are you doing here?

450
00:34:27,742 --> 00:34:30,709
So you were sent by the Security Command?

451
00:34:30,821 --> 00:34:32,934
Ahh... Really...

452
00:34:33,038 --> 00:34:36,179
We can save the details for later,
so let's take all this down.

453
00:34:36,312 --> 00:34:38,283
Hey... You!

454
00:34:40,783 --> 00:34:42,564
Of all people, why you?

455
00:34:42,677 --> 00:34:46,696
Of all the people who could be here,
why did it have to be you?

456
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,866
What's wrong with you?

457
00:34:50,177 --> 00:34:53,215
Listen well.

458
00:34:53,366 --> 00:34:56,778
They're not investigating 
a smuggling case.

459
00:34:56,989 --> 00:35:00,442
They're just trying to steal that!

460
00:35:00,548 --> 00:35:02,788
You understand what I'm saying?

461
00:35:04,109 --> 00:35:05,165
Hey.

462
00:35:05,392 --> 00:35:09,165
Take your family 
and go to Seoul right now.

463
00:35:09,269 --> 00:35:10,974
I'll take care of things here,

464
00:35:11,065 --> 00:35:11,854
so get going.

465
00:35:11,948 --> 00:35:13,651
Now!

466
00:35:14,246 --> 00:35:18,941
Then... You were in 
on all this from the start?

467
00:35:19,054 --> 00:35:23,085
I... need money.

468
00:35:23,248 --> 00:35:27,490
We're about to lose all that land 
you bought in Gangnam, you fool.

469
00:35:27,606 --> 00:35:30,595
Go! We have no time, you fool!

470
00:35:31,586 --> 00:35:35,568
I'm going to bring this 
to the police right away.

471
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:36,913
Hey!

472
00:35:37,026 --> 00:35:38,690
Lee Daesoo!

473
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,304
Even if that makes me a beggar,

474
00:35:40,407 --> 00:35:44,048
I have no intention of becoming
a father my sons can't respect.

475
00:35:44,151 --> 00:35:45,682
Aigoo... You fool!

476
00:35:45,789 --> 00:35:48,367
Why don't you listen to me?

477
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:52,046
Keep it up and you'll die!

478
00:35:54,707 --> 00:35:58,107
Hey... They're here...

479
00:36:03,711 --> 00:36:05,448
Hey!

480
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:19,648
Hey... Listen...

481
00:36:19,789 --> 00:36:21,299
Taeseop.

482
00:36:21,563 --> 00:36:22,786
Run...

483
00:36:22,877 --> 00:36:24,874
Run away!

484
00:36:25,605 --> 00:36:27,510
I can't kill you with my own hands.

485
00:36:27,726 --> 00:36:32,284
Hey... I beg you...
Run away, you fool!

486
00:37:51,349 --> 00:37:53,172
Who's there?

487
00:37:54,386 --> 00:37:55,669
Get him.

488
00:38:06,171 --> 00:38:12,005
See? Before you forced me to,
you should have shot him.

489
00:38:12,956 --> 00:38:16,408
You saw me kill him,
so I can't allow you to survive.

490
00:38:16,512 --> 00:38:19,072
Why can't you be a little more honest?

491
00:38:19,161 --> 00:38:20,491
Just say that, from the very start,

492
00:38:20,614 --> 00:38:22,878
you planned to use me
and then get rid of me.

493
00:38:22,982 --> 00:38:24,142
<i>Isn't that right?</i>

494
00:38:24,331 --> 00:38:28,054
But... You barked up the wrong tree.

495
00:38:28,152 --> 00:38:32,939
I'm not going to die
as easily as that fella.

496
00:38:33,088 --> 00:38:34,776
I'm not going to die that way!

497
00:38:35,333 --> 00:38:36,390
Really?

498
00:38:36,978 --> 00:38:38,003
Then...

499
00:38:38,864 --> 00:38:40,632
Shall we find out?

500
00:38:57,636 --> 00:38:58,985
Look...

501
00:38:59,089 --> 00:39:05,863
It'd just be a waste to kill me this way.

502
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:12,561
With a businessman
like me by your side...

503
00:39:12,704 --> 00:39:14,930
That... Those gold bars...

504
00:39:15,034 --> 00:39:17,790
will be nothing compared
to the money you can make.

505
00:39:19,271 --> 00:39:21,326
I'm a very ambitious man.

506
00:39:21,765 --> 00:39:26,025
Can you satisfy all those ambitions?

507
00:39:26,535 --> 00:39:28,610
If you spare me...

508
00:39:28,733 --> 00:39:33,398
Whatever I'll end up doing,
I will always be loyal to you.

509
00:39:33,855 --> 00:39:36,960
So... Please...

510
00:39:37,106 --> 00:39:38,936
Don't kill me.

511
00:39:59,776 --> 00:40:03,801
From now on, we're partners.

512
00:40:06,032 --> 00:40:08,843
<i>Make sure our construction
business in Gangnam flourishes.</i>

513
00:40:08,952 --> 00:40:11,502
That is, I want to see
money pouring down on me.

514
00:40:11,943 --> 00:40:13,822
Is that clear, Director Hwang?

515
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:08,275
<i>I apologize.</i>

516
00:41:08,945 --> 00:41:12,407
He must have seen us for sure.

517
00:41:14,652 --> 00:41:18,461
By any chance,
do you have anyone in mind?

518
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:26,025
I really have no idea.

519
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:33,187
I'll take care of things here,

520
00:41:33,286 --> 00:41:35,074
so go back to Seoul.

521
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:40,123
<i>Prepare to leave.</i>

522
00:41:40,462 --> 00:41:41,689
<i>Yes.</i>

523
00:41:46,315 --> 00:41:47,975
Dad...

524
00:41:52,497 --> 00:41:54,431
Dad...

525
00:42:38,415 --> 00:42:41,491
What brings you here?

526
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:46,510
My father...

527
00:42:51,029 --> 00:42:53,057
<i>Your father what?</i>

528
00:42:59,607 --> 00:43:01,475
My father...

529
00:43:04,134 --> 00:43:06,475
got drunk...

530
00:43:08,856 --> 00:43:13,252
<i>He got drunk, 
and beat up your mother?</i>

531
00:43:16,225 --> 00:43:17,692
Yes...

532
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:23,938
So, like... You want us
to go and stop them from arguing?

533
00:43:25,315 --> 00:43:27,032
<i>We're too busy now,</i>

534
00:43:27,117 --> 00:43:31,109
<i>so why don't you
ask a neighbor to do that?</i>

535
00:43:31,678 --> 00:43:35,090
- Then, I'll get going.
- Why don't you join me for lunch?

536
00:43:35,166 --> 00:43:37,524
<i>No. Let's do it next time.</i>

537
00:43:41,606 --> 00:43:44,149
<i>~ Jo Pilyeon ~</i>

538
00:43:54,358 --> 00:43:58,179
This is someone 
we must arrest at all cost.

539
00:43:58,292 --> 00:44:00,577
- So we ask you to spare no effort.
- Ahh... Of course!

540
00:44:00,662 --> 00:44:02,418
You needn't even mention it.

541
00:44:02,512 --> 00:44:06,153
- I'll be counting on you, then.
- Yes.

542
00:44:26,503 --> 00:44:27,730
<i>Hyung.</i>

543
00:44:27,909 --> 00:44:29,861
Oppa...

544
00:44:32,597 --> 00:44:34,714
Where's your father?

545
00:44:46,195 --> 00:44:47,397
<i>Dead?!</i>

546
00:44:48,468 --> 00:44:50,733
Your father is dead?

547
00:44:51,763 --> 00:44:53,605
Aigoo... I ought to just...

548
00:44:53,713 --> 00:44:56,756
And you expect us to believe that?

549
00:44:57,581 --> 00:45:00,012
<i>Fine... Let's suppose he really did.</i>

550
00:45:00,106 --> 00:45:01,791
<i>Who killed him?</i>

551
00:45:02,125 --> 00:45:04,928
If he died, someone must have killed him.

552
00:45:07,052 --> 00:45:08,815
Jo Pilyeon.

553
00:45:10,748 --> 00:45:11,786
What?

554
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:13,625
Jo Pilyeon?

555
00:45:14,338 --> 00:45:16,817
He's some high-ranking officer for sure,

556
00:45:16,987 --> 00:45:18,855
and his name is Jo Pilyeon.

557
00:45:19,044 --> 00:45:22,262
What is this?

558
00:45:22,384 --> 00:45:24,943
Chief of Security Jo Pilyeon?!

559
00:45:26,628 --> 00:45:28,345
Are you sure it was Jo Pilyeon?

560
00:45:28,477 --> 00:45:31,609
If that wasn't the case,
how would I know his name?

561
00:45:39,436 --> 00:45:41,077
Tell me.

562
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:43,211
Where is your father,

563
00:45:43,351 --> 00:45:45,681
and who were those people?

564
00:45:47,276 --> 00:45:50,606
I said speak to me!
Where is your father?

565
00:45:53,785 --> 00:45:55,568
He passed away.

566
00:46:00,899 --> 00:46:02,635
What?

567
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:10,935
Dad...

568
00:46:14,595 --> 00:46:16,312
is dead.

569
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,161
- Mom... Mom...
- Mommy!

570
00:46:22,265 --> 00:46:24,341
- Mom...
- Mommy!

571
00:46:24,425 --> 00:46:25,775
- Mom!
- Mom...

572
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:27,498
- Mom, wake up!
- Mom!

573
00:46:28,004 --> 00:46:29,682
<i>- Mom!
- Mom!</i>

574
00:46:29,738 --> 00:46:33,465
<i>Mom!</i>

575
00:46:40,586 --> 00:46:42,525
What brings you here?

576
00:46:42,614 --> 00:46:43,852
We won't beat around the bush.

577
00:46:43,955 --> 00:46:47,804
Let's split those goods.

578
00:46:50,312 --> 00:46:55,245
You stole smuggled goods,
so we are no different.

579
00:46:55,361 --> 00:46:56,783
And if we do split,

580
00:46:57,610 --> 00:46:58,858
my share?

581
00:46:59,056 --> 00:47:00,934
It's the four of us and you,

582
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:02,260
so one-fifth each.

583
00:47:02,364 --> 00:47:04,402
One-fifth each...

584
00:47:05,252 --> 00:47:06,883
I'm thankful.

585
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:10,788
But...

586
00:47:11,431 --> 00:47:13,878
There is something 
you don't seem to understand.

587
00:47:14,067 --> 00:47:20,416
I didn't steal the goods you smuggled, 
but merely confiscated them.

588
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:23,474
What are you waiting for?
Arrest them for smuggling!

589
00:47:23,570 --> 00:47:25,067
Yes, Chief.

590
00:47:27,204 --> 00:47:28,600
<i>On your knees, you pricks.</i>

591
00:47:28,891 --> 00:47:30,715
I said on your knees!

592
00:47:32,997 --> 00:47:37,219
Don't think you can fool me 
and get away with it.

593
00:47:37,653 --> 00:47:42,216
A word from me is all it takes
for your life to end in misery.

594
00:47:42,455 --> 00:47:45,056
We will give you half those gold bars.

595
00:47:45,165 --> 00:47:46,413
Half?

596
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:49,592
Take them away,
and report to our superiors.

597
00:47:49,762 --> 00:47:50,948
Yes, Chief.

598
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:55,287
Tell us the amount you want.

599
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:59,904
We will give you whatever you ask.

600
00:47:59,984 --> 00:48:03,797
What is it that you want?

601
00:48:06,979 --> 00:48:10,148
To never see human trash like you...

602
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:14,940
stink up the society our president
worked so hard to bring us.

603
00:48:15,961 --> 00:48:17,600
What are you waiting for?

604
00:48:17,761 --> 00:48:19,629
Get up, you pricks!

605
00:48:19,996 --> 00:48:22,075
We will give it all to you.

606
00:48:22,185 --> 00:48:26,480
Without a single condition,
we will give everything to you.

607
00:48:26,716 --> 00:48:30,216
So spare us.

608
00:48:32,668 --> 00:48:34,046
I'll decide for you.

609
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:35,461
80 to 20.

610
00:48:35,616 --> 00:48:38,946
Eighty for me, twenty for you.

611
00:48:40,295 --> 00:48:42,173
If you think of it as 
the price for your survival,

612
00:48:42,276 --> 00:48:44,880
I'm sure you won't feel cheated.

613
00:48:46,756 --> 00:48:51,980
But who's the man who saw me, 
from inside the truck?

614
00:48:52,131 --> 00:48:53,612
What?

615
00:48:55,706 --> 00:48:58,227
Wasn't it one of you?

616
00:49:01,562 --> 00:49:05,331
Did you tell them?

617
00:49:05,787 --> 00:49:06,944
Yes.

618
00:49:11,259 --> 00:49:13,198
We can't stay here any longer.

619
00:49:13,478 --> 00:49:15,155
Mom...

620
00:49:15,458 --> 00:49:17,834
Pack up a few clothes.

621
00:49:18,611 --> 00:49:20,412
What's wrong, Mom?

622
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:21,952
Didn't you say both the smugglers,

623
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:24,336
those people and the Chief of Police
are on the same boat?

624
00:49:24,525 --> 00:49:27,846
There's no time.
Get moving! Now!

625
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:35,587
Of all people who could see us, his son?!

626
00:49:35,690 --> 00:49:37,423
Don't worry.

627
00:49:37,522 --> 00:49:38,625
They'll catch him soon.

628
00:49:38,722 --> 00:49:40,973
And when they do, then what?

629
00:49:41,825 --> 00:49:42,879
You must get rid of him.

630
00:49:42,973 --> 00:49:47,104
You must get rid of everyone
who saw me kill him, is that clear?

631
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:01,521
Seems like they already ran away?

632
00:50:02,842 --> 00:50:04,523
To the station!

633
00:50:07,326 --> 00:50:09,506
<i>~ Seoul <-> Busan ~</i>

634
00:50:36,757 --> 00:50:38,809
Over there!

635
00:50:42,112 --> 00:50:43,693
Step out!

636
00:51:28,323 --> 00:51:30,832
Pull yourselves up.

637
00:51:33,721 --> 00:51:36,069
We're going to Seoul.

638
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:40,965
With the land Daddy bought in Gangnam,

639
00:51:41,504 --> 00:51:46,243
we will have no problem making a living.

640
00:51:46,633 --> 00:51:47,667
Even without him,

641
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:53,438
I'll send you all to college,
and marry you off.

642
00:51:53,543 --> 00:51:55,841
You don't need to worry.

643
00:52:00,038 --> 00:52:01,598
And Dad?

644
00:52:03,566 --> 00:52:05,917
How about his body?

645
00:52:06,009 --> 00:52:08,170
Can we just run away by ourselves?

646
00:52:14,335 --> 00:52:15,920
We can just...

647
00:52:16,533 --> 00:52:18,514
come back for it later.

648
00:52:23,071 --> 00:52:24,977
Later...

649
00:52:25,806 --> 00:52:30,147
We'll find those people
and make them pay for what they did,

650
00:52:30,870 --> 00:52:32,760
and after that,

651
00:52:34,071 --> 00:52:36,433
we can take care of him.

652
00:53:11,005 --> 00:53:12,429
Hey...

653
00:53:14,021 --> 00:53:16,382
If I knew it'd be you, you fool...

654
00:53:17,005 --> 00:53:19,047
I wouldn't even have gone there.

655
00:53:20,343 --> 00:53:22,641
You know that I mean it, right?

656
00:53:23,430 --> 00:53:25,141
Of all people...

657
00:53:25,594 --> 00:53:29,556
Of all people, why did you show up?

658
00:53:30,782 --> 00:53:34,848
You died because of me.

659
00:53:36,471 --> 00:53:40,442
It's my fault you died.

660
00:53:41,137 --> 00:53:43,432
Because of this stupid fool,

661
00:53:44,065 --> 00:53:46,507
you ended up dying.

662
00:53:57,615 --> 00:53:58,917
So?

663
00:53:59,615 --> 00:54:02,566
So what, you prick?

664
00:54:02,743 --> 00:54:03,877
You...

665
00:54:03,987 --> 00:54:07,113
You are already dead!

666
00:54:11,179 --> 00:54:12,446
Fine...

667
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:16,078
Forget the dead,

668
00:54:16,373 --> 00:54:18,833
as the living must go on.

669
00:54:19,213 --> 00:54:23,668
I even had to get you killed 
for this opportunity.

670
00:54:23,963 --> 00:54:25,811
I, Hwang Taeseop!

671
00:54:25,998 --> 00:54:28,668
Will succeed at all cost!

672
00:54:29,111 --> 00:54:32,074
All the money in this world...

673
00:54:32,334 --> 00:54:35,858
will end up in my hands.

674
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:43,716
Hey... Buddy.

675
00:54:44,895 --> 00:54:48,829
Even if from down there,

676
00:54:49,329 --> 00:54:51,263
you must take a good look.

677
00:54:51,357 --> 00:54:52,603
Uh?!

678
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:56,957
How I succeed...

679
00:54:57,281 --> 00:55:00,998
And how I hold the world
in the palm of my hands!

680
00:55:01,209 --> 00:55:04,348
Open your eyes
and take a good look, you fool!

681
00:55:05,989 --> 00:55:07,085
<i>Hey...</i>

682
00:55:07,689 --> 00:55:09,293
Daesoo.

683
00:55:10,189 --> 00:55:12,340
Lee Daesoo!

684
00:55:13,283 --> 00:55:17,248
Why don't you answer me?

685
00:55:26,411 --> 00:55:29,957
Answer me...

686
00:55:50,138 --> 00:55:52,026
<i>Don't cry.</i>

687
00:55:54,773 --> 00:55:57,251
I said don't cry.

688
00:56:02,287 --> 00:56:06,448
<i>~ Daejeon Station ~</i>

689
00:56:06,665 --> 00:56:12,117
<i>The current stop is Daejeon Station.</i>

690
00:56:18,324 --> 00:56:19,673
Gangmo.

691
00:56:20,361 --> 00:56:21,793
<i>Get up.</i>

692
00:56:26,509 --> 00:56:27,301
Mom!

693
00:56:27,386 --> 00:56:28,796
- Mom.
- Mom...

694
00:56:28,873 --> 00:56:31,329
- Mom, wake up.
- They're here.

695
00:56:31,935 --> 00:56:34,367
Take this. Come on.

696
00:56:36,270 --> 00:56:37,455
Gangmo.

697
00:56:38,134 --> 00:56:39,285
Listen well.

698
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:42,040
The moment the train starts again, 
you and Mom step out.

699
00:56:42,144 --> 00:56:43,474
- Understood?
- Hyung...

700
00:56:43,615 --> 00:56:44,680
Seongmo, and you?

701
00:56:44,771 --> 00:56:46,500
If we all do it, they'll catch us.

702
00:56:46,632 --> 00:56:49,057
I'll buy time luring them 
on the opposite side,

703
00:56:49,236 --> 00:56:51,161
so go ahead first 
and take Mom to Seoul.

704
00:56:51,312 --> 00:56:53,651
Then, how are we going to meet?

705
00:56:54,048 --> 00:56:55,827
At the end of this month,

706
00:56:56,064 --> 00:56:57,902
let's meet on top of 
Seoul's tallest building.

707
00:56:58,016 --> 00:56:59,204
Got it?

708
00:56:59,846 --> 00:57:01,595
There's no time, go!

709
00:57:02,730 --> 00:57:04,113
Seongmo...

710
00:57:04,324 --> 00:57:06,507
We'll meet again soon.

711
00:57:17,165 --> 00:57:18,137
Hey!

712
00:57:18,325 --> 00:57:20,325
Ohh? That...

713
00:57:35,353 --> 00:57:38,065
Mom, stay here a moment with Miju.

714
00:57:38,772 --> 00:57:40,489
Hyung!

715
00:57:40,725 --> 00:57:43,763
Hyung!
Hyung!

716
00:57:44,096 --> 00:57:46,970
Hyung!

717
00:57:47,270 --> 00:57:48,778
Hyung!

718
00:57:52,482 --> 00:57:54,120
<i>Go!</i>

719
00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:16,592
Hyung!

720
00:58:17,532 --> 00:58:19,894
Don't forget our promise, Hyung!

721
00:58:22,477 --> 00:58:25,219
We must meet again!

722
00:58:25,829 --> 00:58:27,870
Hyung!

723
00:58:41,824 --> 00:58:43,607
Jo Pilyeon is the one 
who took the gold bars.

724
00:58:43,768 --> 00:58:45,570
Why are you going after us?

725
00:58:45,791 --> 00:58:49,551
You just shouldn't have
witnessed your father's death.

726
00:58:49,683 --> 00:58:50,956
So...

727
00:58:52,671 --> 00:58:54,591
is that why you want us dead?

728
00:58:55,034 --> 00:58:56,223
But...

729
00:58:57,902 --> 00:59:00,100
Where's the rest of your family?

730
00:59:06,257 --> 00:59:08,240
That...

731
00:59:09,172 --> 00:59:11,162
Go tell Jo Pilyeon.

732
00:59:11,455 --> 00:59:15,533
That one day I will come back 
to avenge my father.

733
00:59:19,524 --> 00:59:21,542
That crazy fool...

734
00:59:42,839 --> 00:59:45,122
- Mommy...
- Mom!

735
00:59:47,622 --> 00:59:50,867
Oppa, Mommy is burning.

736
01:00:01,298 --> 01:00:03,376
<i>~ Inn ~</i>

737
01:00:04,793 --> 01:00:05,697
Ajumma.

738
01:00:05,803 --> 01:00:06,971
Give us a room.

739
01:00:07,134 --> 01:00:10,067
We only have two large ones here.

740
01:00:10,155 --> 01:00:13,029
One for women, the other for men.

741
01:00:13,579 --> 01:00:15,232
Mom, go in first.

742
01:00:15,334 --> 01:00:17,522
- You have enough money?
- Yeah.

743
01:00:17,804 --> 01:00:19,562
Miju...

744
01:00:19,883 --> 01:00:21,346
How much is it?

745
01:00:21,752 --> 01:00:23,883
It's 200 won each,

746
01:00:24,468 --> 01:00:25,855
so that'll be 800 for all of you.

747
01:00:25,993 --> 01:00:27,110
That expensive?!

748
01:00:27,224 --> 01:00:29,344
Then go somewhere else.

749
01:00:29,499 --> 01:00:33,108
When the last train goes,
there'll be no empty rooms anywhere.

750
01:00:33,248 --> 01:00:34,410
By the way...

751
01:00:34,561 --> 01:00:36,164
Why is it 800 won?

752
01:00:36,474 --> 01:00:38,485
We're only three, so it should be 600.

753
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:40,723
What about what she's embracing?

754
01:00:41,968 --> 01:00:43,044
Even the baby needs to pay?

755
01:00:43,166 --> 01:00:44,952
If the baby wakes up and starts crying,

756
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:47,072
what if all the other
customers start leaving?

757
01:00:47,327 --> 01:00:50,006
<i>I even give you a room out of courtesy...</i>

758
01:00:54,318 --> 01:00:56,346
So are you staying or what?

759
01:00:58,846 --> 01:01:00,410
Three women only.

760
01:01:00,499 --> 01:01:02,334
And you're not staying?

761
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:35,230
<i>The train for Busan will soon depart,</i>

762
01:01:35,362 --> 01:01:40,163
<i>so we encourage all passengers 
to head for the appropriate exit.</i>

763
01:01:46,097 --> 01:01:49,097
<i>The train for Busan will soon depart,</i>

764
01:01:49,239 --> 01:01:55,173
<i>so we encourage all passengers
to head for the appropriate exit.</i>

765
01:02:20,546 --> 01:02:23,882
They must be around here for sure.

766
01:02:24,043 --> 01:02:26,175
<i>Let's ransack the whole place tomorrow.</i>

767
01:02:26,929 --> 01:02:28,618
What could have happened to him?

768
01:02:28,712 --> 01:02:31,206
When you have a death wish, 
anything is possible.

769
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:33,366
<i>Crazy fool...</i>

770
01:02:33,697 --> 01:02:36,338
Jumping off a moving train...

771
01:03:11,859 --> 01:03:12,822
Go away.

772
01:03:12,944 --> 01:03:14,095
Now!

773
01:03:15,803 --> 01:03:19,472
This is the women's room.
You're the one who should leave.

774
01:03:48,618 --> 01:03:50,218
You're a pickpocket, aren't you?

775
01:03:50,524 --> 01:03:51,675
What?

776
01:03:51,967 --> 01:03:56,138
If you go around here stealing,
you must be familiar with this place?!

777
01:03:56,299 --> 01:03:59,142
I'm looking for someone,
but I've never been here before.

778
01:03:59,232 --> 01:04:00,902
Will you help me out?

779
01:04:01,185 --> 01:04:03,148
You don't even have
a place to sleep, anyway.

780
01:04:03,242 --> 01:04:05,386
Looks like you need money,

781
01:04:06,801 --> 01:04:08,235
so I'll give you a thousand won.

782
01:04:08,490 --> 01:04:09,688
You little brat...

783
01:04:09,801 --> 01:04:11,160
1,500.

784
01:04:11,575 --> 01:04:13,169
Can't go higher than that.

785
01:04:14,964 --> 01:04:18,282
I don't need any of that,
so get out of my face.

786
01:04:18,392 --> 01:04:19,349
Really?

787
01:04:19,498 --> 01:04:20,990
Too bad, then.

788
01:04:22,264 --> 01:04:24,594
Ajeosshi! There's a...

789
01:04:43,639 --> 01:04:45,422
Who are you touching
with those dirty hands?

790
01:04:45,620 --> 01:04:47,403
You thief...

791
01:04:52,362 --> 01:04:53,876
I'm not a thief.

792
01:04:53,999 --> 01:04:55,367
Then, what are you?

793
01:04:55,753 --> 01:04:57,168
Lee Gangmo.

794
01:04:57,730 --> 01:05:01,554
The name my father gave me...

795
01:05:01,646 --> 01:05:03,386
is Lee Gangmo.
