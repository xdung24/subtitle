Episode 46

4
00:00:56,616 --> 00:00:58,257
Jo Minwoo.

5
00:01:19,024 --> 00:01:21,887
I hear you're facing quite the
headaches with those boilers.

6
00:01:22,087 --> 00:01:23,449
It's all been solved.

7
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:24,909
Really?

8
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:27,863
That's not what I've heard?!

9
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:32,533
Is our factory manager doing fine?

10
00:01:34,609 --> 00:01:37,792
Seeing how he stole our core technology,

11
00:01:37,907 --> 00:01:42,224
I guess you're looking to
develop a new boiler as well.

12
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:45,819
The factory you acquired
is nothing but an empty shell.

13
00:01:45,928 --> 00:01:46,983
I'm sure you'll soon come to realize it.

14
00:01:47,098 --> 00:01:52,380
Can you really develop a
proper boiler with stolen technology?

15
00:01:54,384 --> 00:01:56,401
What a shame...

16
00:01:57,053 --> 00:01:59,178
Now you treat me like a thief
without a shred of evidence?!

17
00:01:59,335 --> 00:02:03,701
You sure didn't betray my expectations.

18
00:02:04,618 --> 00:02:06,808
It's just like your father said.

19
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:10,876
He might steal from you, but he is
honest enough to do it in your face.

20
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:12,364
No...

21
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,154
Maybe "daring" would fit him better.

22
00:02:14,325 --> 00:02:16,673
The results will tell the story.

23
00:02:17,031 --> 00:02:20,094
Because justice doesn't bring you success.

24
00:02:20,681 --> 00:02:23,487
It's success that brings you justice.

25
00:02:23,859 --> 00:02:27,361
I'll keep those words in mind.

26
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:30,668
Because you will be defeated,

27
00:02:30,825 --> 00:02:35,392
and be scorned at for your cowardice.

28
00:02:36,382 --> 00:02:38,970
The same which led
you to say those words.

29
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,565
What is this?

30
00:03:03,529 --> 00:03:05,678
I came here to meet an advertiser.

31
00:03:05,763 --> 00:03:07,338
Please, leave.

32
00:03:07,536 --> 00:03:08,610
Sit.

33
00:03:08,702 --> 00:03:10,409
Minwoo!

34
00:03:11,718 --> 00:03:15,985
I am the advertiser you were waiting for.

35
00:03:16,973 --> 00:03:19,535
I ordered steak,
knowing how much you like it.

36
00:03:20,121 --> 00:03:20,895
Is that fine with you?

37
00:03:20,995 --> 00:03:22,741
How do you explain all this?

38
00:03:22,956 --> 00:03:27,036
- My manager talked of a Suyoung Construction?
- I guess he heard wrong.

39
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:30,782
Sit.

40
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,616
Among the clauses in that contract...

41
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:37,940
was the fact that
you'd accept all our requests.

42
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:42,162
If you truly have no feelings left for me,

43
00:03:43,354 --> 00:03:46,556
then there is no reason why
you'd avoid meeting me for business.

44
00:03:46,984 --> 00:03:50,378
On the contrary, it's a huge
opportunity for a newcomer like you,

45
00:03:50,932 --> 00:03:52,826
so you should just go for it.

46
00:03:52,969 --> 00:03:57,263
What should I do to terminate that contract?

47
00:03:58,856 --> 00:04:01,729
You could just read it
and find out by yourself,

48
00:04:02,055 --> 00:04:04,770
but all you need to do is
pay three times the signing fee.

49
00:04:05,394 --> 00:04:08,120
Aren't you being shameless?

50
00:04:08,704 --> 00:04:11,220
You're the one who
forced me into this state,

51
00:04:11,327 --> 00:04:15,306
and pushed me to go through
all this just to see you smile.

52
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:18,813
So blame yourself.

53
00:04:21,047 --> 00:04:23,595
Your order is ready, Sir.

54
00:04:26,614 --> 00:04:28,520
Sit.

55
00:04:29,598 --> 00:04:32,213
Before I do something even worse.

56
00:04:51,741 --> 00:04:52,915
What's the matter?

57
00:04:53,024 --> 00:04:54,840
Thought I saw someone.

58
00:04:55,276 --> 00:04:56,836
Who?

59
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,270
I'm sure it wasn't her.
Let's eat.

60
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:09,225
What?

61
00:05:09,368 --> 00:05:11,587
Can't you cut it into smaller pieces?

62
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:13,745
Then you lose all the taste.

63
00:05:24,711 --> 00:05:27,486
I know how much I disappointed you.

64
00:05:28,803 --> 00:05:33,785
Since I couldn't
protect you from my father.

65
00:05:33,942 --> 00:05:36,462
I told you that wasn't the issue, didn't I?

66
00:05:36,986 --> 00:05:38,532
If it's not,

67
00:05:38,818 --> 00:05:41,380
then why on earth
are you acting like this?

68
00:05:44,679 --> 00:05:49,997
The more you meet me,
the worse you'll feel.

69
00:05:50,137 --> 00:05:51,830
So please, stop.

70
00:05:51,945 --> 00:05:54,092
I don't know how I could let go of you.

71
00:05:54,235 --> 00:05:57,521
I can't erase you from my mind.

72
00:06:11,884 --> 00:06:16,080
Then... I guess there's only one solution left.

73
00:06:17,225 --> 00:06:22,807
I'll have to force you to hate me instead.

74
00:06:23,752 --> 00:06:26,028
If you think you can, be my guest.

75
00:06:26,876 --> 00:06:29,609
What have you been
doing these last four years?

76
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:32,708
Must I really tell you?

77
00:06:41,475 --> 00:06:47,341
From now on, we'll dine
together when I ask you to.

78
00:06:48,139 --> 00:06:50,195
Another clause of that
contract, you can check it.

79
00:06:50,277 --> 00:06:53,331
Did you just use that to buy me?

80
00:06:54,055 --> 00:06:55,892
For now.

81
00:07:06,814 --> 00:07:09,398
Want something
else other than that steak?

82
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:12,354
Thank you for the dinner.

83
00:07:12,589 --> 00:07:14,280
I'll drive you home.

84
00:07:16,371 --> 00:07:18,215
Is that another one of your clauses?

85
00:07:18,309 --> 00:07:20,224
Buying me dinner and driving me home.

86
00:07:20,376 --> 00:07:24,482
Tomorrow we will go back
to that riverbank we've been to.

87
00:07:25,905 --> 00:07:27,853
I'll come to get you.

88
00:08:05,906 --> 00:08:08,782
Why didn't you tell me it
was a Manbo Construction CF?

89
00:08:09,016 --> 00:08:10,132
What are you talking about?

90
00:08:10,226 --> 00:08:12,141
It was a Manbo Construction CF?!

91
00:08:12,247 --> 00:08:13,785
Ohh... That?

92
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:16,511
Turns out I heard it wrong.

93
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,183
Does that make any sense?

94
00:08:18,254 --> 00:08:20,556
What's the big deal?

95
00:08:20,662 --> 00:08:24,209
If it's a huge corporation like
Manbo Construction, all the better...

96
00:08:24,362 --> 00:08:25,830
And how about the contractual terms?

97
00:08:25,901 --> 00:08:29,064
Were you aware of any
additional clauses besides the usual?

98
00:08:29,216 --> 00:08:32,071
I was too busy to read all the fine print...

99
00:08:32,176 --> 00:08:37,899
I just thought it would be all right,
considering who we were dealing with.

100
00:08:38,015 --> 00:08:40,528
Why, is anything wrong?

101
00:08:40,622 --> 00:08:42,125
The contract is at the office, right?

102
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:44,580
I'll have to check that out first.

103
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:47,505
But I don't think your
schedule would allow that...

104
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:49,725
That's more urgent to me!

105
00:08:50,865 --> 00:08:52,456
Let's hurry up.

106
00:09:09,743 --> 00:09:10,577
Miju?

107
00:09:10,659 --> 00:09:13,126
Miss Cha Soojeong!

108
00:09:18,917 --> 00:09:20,303
Oppa...

109
00:09:20,785 --> 00:09:22,601
Here, take it.

110
00:09:22,989 --> 00:09:26,207
You can't imagine how much he's
been pestering me to come see you.

111
00:09:26,289 --> 00:09:28,380
Like you didn't want to...

112
00:09:28,545 --> 00:09:30,389
Aww... I'm hungry.

113
00:09:37,351 --> 00:09:40,206
But, aren't you two getting married?

114
00:09:40,596 --> 00:09:41,758
Uh?!

115
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:44,418
Aren't you seeing anyone?

116
00:09:44,561 --> 00:09:47,600
He's not too popular with women.

117
00:09:47,805 --> 00:09:49,681
Like you are.

118
00:09:50,052 --> 00:09:50,961
Me?

119
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,688
Of course I am.

120
00:09:52,864 --> 00:09:55,084
I'm so popular,
I can't take it anymore.

121
00:09:55,202 --> 00:09:56,012
Really?

122
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:57,316
Big Oppa, is that really true?

123
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:59,724
No comment.

124
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:02,441
Be right back.
Make him confess.

125
00:10:06,623 --> 00:10:09,947
You never dated
even once, have you?

126
00:10:11,998 --> 00:10:13,506
Miju.

127
00:10:14,652 --> 00:10:16,578
By any chance,

128
00:10:17,588 --> 00:10:21,253
is Jo Minwoo bothering you?

129
00:10:21,993 --> 00:10:24,695
You don't need to worry.

130
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:28,605
Good to hear, then.

131
00:10:30,768 --> 00:10:32,176
It's hard, isn't it?

132
00:10:32,317 --> 00:10:36,087
Nah... With you by
my side, why would it be?

133
00:10:37,032 --> 00:10:38,507
Just say the word.

134
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,655
I will help you every step of the way.

135
00:10:40,831 --> 00:10:42,076
Got it?

136
00:10:42,182 --> 00:10:44,426
All right.

137
00:10:47,889 --> 00:10:49,345
You two...

138
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:51,497
Talked behind my
back all this time, didn't you?

139
00:10:51,591 --> 00:10:55,004
Wow... How did he guess?
You can't fool him.

140
00:10:55,098 --> 00:10:58,269
My ears were burning.

141
00:11:10,486 --> 00:11:13,951
All our top business acquaintances
have turned their backs on us?

142
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:16,218
That's right.

143
00:11:18,341 --> 00:11:22,772
So Noh Gapsoo is
finally declaring war against me.

144
00:11:22,854 --> 00:11:24,463
And it doesn't stop at that,

145
00:11:24,675 --> 00:11:29,019
as he's trying to make all stocks of
companies we invested in hit the bottom.

146
00:11:31,252 --> 00:11:33,531
Director.

147
00:11:33,719 --> 00:11:35,905
It's Miss Jeongyeon.

148
00:11:36,384 --> 00:11:39,229
Jeongyeon must not learn of this.

149
00:11:39,335 --> 00:11:41,308
All right.

150
00:11:42,107 --> 00:11:43,935
Come on in.

151
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:58,080
Have you completed that business plan?

152
00:11:58,186 --> 00:11:59,630
Yes.

153
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:10,731
To obtain our permit for the credit institution,

154
00:12:10,825 --> 00:12:13,883
we will have to go through
very complex legal procedures.

155
00:12:14,059 --> 00:12:14,975
That's right.

156
00:12:15,093 --> 00:12:19,486
And we will need a start-up capital
of at least thirty billion won.

157
00:12:19,662 --> 00:12:23,468
Any concrete plans on
how to secure that capital?

158
00:12:23,898 --> 00:12:26,348
I'm weighing the options on...

159
00:12:26,565 --> 00:12:31,766
So you came to me
with an incomplete plan?

160
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:38,563
Or you really believed I would
invest that much money all on my own?

161
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:42,145
- No.. I never implied...
- This is unacceptable.

162
00:12:42,467 --> 00:12:44,006
Leave.

163
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:50,356
I'll come again and bring
you a more concrete plan.

164
00:12:50,931 --> 00:12:55,448
I don't want you
to disappoint me again.

165
00:12:55,565 --> 00:12:57,537
All right.

166
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:19,285
- A Night for the 88 Olympic Games -
Businessmen Gather in Seoul

167
00:13:20,094 --> 00:13:20,836
Eonni...

168
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:23,538
You'll pierce a hole
through that newspaper.

169
00:13:28,361 --> 00:13:34,083
How could the director tell you to
find those thirty billion all on your own?!

170
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:36,604
She had no reason not to.

171
00:13:39,165 --> 00:13:40,304
Jina.

172
00:13:40,492 --> 00:13:46,894
Find out whether Deputy Mayor Han
Myeongseok is in charge of this event.

173
00:13:47,732 --> 00:13:49,807
Why are you asking?

174
00:13:55,768 --> 00:14:00,220
So you want to help with the event?

175
00:14:00,443 --> 00:14:01,841
Yes.

176
00:14:03,379 --> 00:14:07,949
Your father has been backing
quite a few congressmen as of late, too.

177
00:14:08,102 --> 00:14:10,922
Is this all to help your
father's entry into politics?

178
00:14:11,052 --> 00:14:14,846
Since it's you, I'll be honest.

179
00:14:15,944 --> 00:14:20,460
I'm planning to open a credit institution.

180
00:14:22,196 --> 00:14:23,271
Is that so?

181
00:14:23,378 --> 00:14:25,599
And I need investors.

182
00:14:26,155 --> 00:14:31,519
So by helping the event I'm supervising,

183
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:34,244
you will muster the
financial backing you need.

184
00:14:34,565 --> 00:14:35,877
Yes.

185
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:38,537
Help me out, Deputy.

186
00:14:39,592 --> 00:14:42,190
It would surely help my cause as well.

187
00:14:42,308 --> 00:14:45,585
Here... Let's help each other.

188
00:14:47,523 --> 00:14:49,379
Thank you.

189
00:14:52,386 --> 00:14:57,763
- Agreement -
I approve the constitutional amendment

190
00:15:01,244 --> 00:15:03,884
Did you bring the account as well?

191
00:15:22,553 --> 00:15:28,751
Once I can convince enough ruling
party members to reach the quorum,

192
00:15:29,103 --> 00:15:31,731
I will approach the opposition as well.

193
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:36,230
They must never find out
the source of this account.

194
00:15:36,355 --> 00:15:37,463
I know.

195
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:41,092
I will keep the list and account.

196
00:15:41,862 --> 00:15:46,777
Because if anything happens, we
must get rid of all material evidence.

197
00:15:47,449 --> 00:15:50,477
We'll get going, then.

198
00:15:59,507 --> 00:16:02,017
I will handle this.

199
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:08,940
I've heard rumors that Chief Oh and
Jo Pilyeon are meeting frequently as of late.

200
00:16:09,339 --> 00:16:11,430
You do that.

201
00:17:02,843 --> 00:17:05,195
Mountaineering this,
study group that...

202
00:17:05,289 --> 00:17:07,709
There are way too many outside
groups forming among ruling party members.

203
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:12,055
With the country in this state, is this
the time to be worrying about their hobbies?

204
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:17,102
You really think those people gather
simply to share their hobbies?

205
00:17:17,445 --> 00:17:19,747
So that's why I'm telling you.

206
00:17:19,923 --> 00:17:21,203
No need to look elsewhere.

207
00:17:21,297 --> 00:17:22,742
The way I see it,
these are bonafide factions.

208
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:26,524
And that's exactly what we
were focusing our attention on.

209
00:17:26,607 --> 00:17:29,102
Any good news to tell me?

210
00:17:29,207 --> 00:17:34,792
There is a lot of clamor over the constitutional
amendment among ruling party members.

211
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:36,946
And who would they be?

212
00:17:37,246 --> 00:17:40,178
I don't need any conclusive evidence.
Who are we dealing with?

213
00:17:40,296 --> 00:17:42,711
You're dealing with congressmen here.

214
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:45,341
Ruling party members at that.

215
00:17:45,462 --> 00:17:49,183
We can't use a few complaints bandied
about over a drink to inculpate them.

216
00:17:49,265 --> 00:17:51,298
Look, Chief Oh.

217
00:17:51,474 --> 00:17:55,121
Any crime they commit
won't be an accidental misstep.

218
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:57,236
Because the moment they show their
approval for the constitutional amendment,

219
00:17:57,318 --> 00:17:58,657
they'll be guilty of treason.

220
00:17:58,727 --> 00:18:00,184
So even if we don't
have any clear evidence,

221
00:18:00,325 --> 00:18:02,416
you must do everything
in your power to create some.

222
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:03,954
Aren't you listening to me?

223
00:18:04,107 --> 00:18:06,609
I said you're dealing
with ruling party members!

224
00:18:06,703 --> 00:18:08,717
Seems like I'm
not making myself clear.

225
00:18:10,996 --> 00:18:12,171
Fine.

226
00:18:12,347 --> 00:18:17,104
Who do you think is
most likely to be the culprit?

227
00:18:25,357 --> 00:18:28,364
I finally realized it
thanks to mountaineering.

228
00:18:28,634 --> 00:18:30,502
The steeper the mountain,

229
00:18:30,608 --> 00:18:33,180
the more people
you'll need by your side.

230
00:18:33,671 --> 00:18:38,780
More people you can rely on,
and reach the summit with.

231
00:18:39,803 --> 00:18:47,342
We'll go for Mount Jiri next month,
and our numbers will triple.

232
00:18:47,628 --> 00:18:49,081
Is everyone confident?

233
00:18:49,198 --> 00:18:50,690
It has to be done.

234
00:18:50,866 --> 00:18:53,615
It must.

235
00:19:01,824 --> 00:19:04,160
What are you doing at
a mountaineering gathering?

236
00:19:04,278 --> 00:19:06,827
How have you been, Congressman Kang?

237
00:19:10,828 --> 00:19:12,571
Congressman Park...

238
00:19:12,876 --> 00:19:15,494
I see Congressman Kwon as well.

239
00:19:21,224 --> 00:19:23,481
If you're really that
interested, join our club.

240
00:19:23,563 --> 00:19:25,572
More than the mountains,

241
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:27,984
I find the company
here a lot more enticing.

242
00:19:28,113 --> 00:19:29,828
What's that supposed to mean?

243
00:19:29,922 --> 00:19:31,708
I recall someone saying this.

244
00:19:31,989 --> 00:19:38,062
That nobody was as enlightened as
the ruling party's mountaineering club members.

245
00:19:40,087 --> 00:19:45,134
Seeing the talent on display, it does
seem as if those weren't unfounded rumors.

246
00:19:45,322 --> 00:19:49,868
It's indeed a remarkable
collection of great minds.

247
00:19:52,185 --> 00:19:55,986
You're spoiling the mood.

248
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:57,748
If you didn't come here
to have a drink, just...

249
00:19:57,795 --> 00:20:04,784
I believe that this country needs a
constitutional amendment to survive.

250
00:20:06,804 --> 00:20:11,926
However, the amendment I was thinking
about differs from what has been mentioned.

251
00:20:12,067 --> 00:20:14,474
Even if we have to fix
the constitution to allow it,

252
00:20:15,764 --> 00:20:19,226
we must move to a parliamentary cabinet system.

253
00:20:20,131 --> 00:20:22,378
Parliamentary cabinet?!

254
00:20:22,755 --> 00:20:25,104
Are you suggesting we
nominate a prime minister?

255
00:20:25,726 --> 00:20:27,171
And who would be entrusted this task?

256
00:20:27,265 --> 00:20:28,804
Need to ask?

257
00:20:28,945 --> 00:20:31,380
It obviously will be the president.

258
00:20:32,863 --> 00:20:36,986
That can only mean an unlimited rule...

259
00:20:37,127 --> 00:20:38,219
And why not?

260
00:20:38,313 --> 00:20:40,803
Don't you know what the
people are asking for right now?

261
00:20:40,874 --> 00:20:44,962
It is only a statistically
insignificant minority.

262
00:20:45,297 --> 00:20:49,996
Everyone else just follows their village
headman's decision like a loyal mutt.

263
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:51,499
Get out of here!

264
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,285
Spare me all that nonsense
and get out of my face!

265
00:20:53,449 --> 00:20:56,221
But when that "nonsense" becomes reality,

266
00:20:56,374 --> 00:20:59,902
history will be written anew.

267
00:21:00,877 --> 00:21:02,756
While you enjoy your mountain-climbing,

268
00:21:02,921 --> 00:21:06,903
I suggest you bear that in mind.

269
00:21:20,664 --> 00:21:22,931
Don't let that intimidate you.

270
00:21:23,213 --> 00:21:26,914
Swaying off our path will only mean defeat.

271
00:21:33,677 --> 00:21:37,263
So you think they're the ones who
approve of the constitutional amendment?

272
00:21:37,731 --> 00:21:39,512
I still am not sure.

273
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:43,752
But all I need is one of them
betraying everyone else.

274
00:21:44,187 --> 00:21:51,150
Because one of them coming to
me is all I need to expose them all.

275
00:21:53,649 --> 00:21:55,281
Gangmo.

276
00:21:55,641 --> 00:21:58,448
Manbo Construction is
having a press conference.

277
00:21:58,561 --> 00:21:59,416
About what?

278
00:21:59,522 --> 00:22:01,108
They said it's about their boiler branch.

279
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:02,599
Boiler?!

280
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:04,721
Why would they suddenly
enter the boiler business?!

281
00:22:04,803 --> 00:22:06,753
There is no doubt now.

282
00:22:06,882 --> 00:22:10,641
They stole our technology for sure.

283
00:22:13,601 --> 00:22:16,648
- Manbo Construction, Ondol-Based
Korean-Style Boiler Development Conference -

284
00:22:17,939 --> 00:22:22,298
We will install boilers in every Suseo
apartment under construction.

285
00:22:22,415 --> 00:22:24,399
Are you going to cooperate
with Hangang Construction and...

286
00:22:24,471 --> 00:22:25,516
use the boilers from their
recently acquired Beaute?

287
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:30,885
To my knowledge, Beaute still
hasn't resolved their gas leak issues.

288
00:22:30,967 --> 00:22:35,484
So what you're suggesting is that you
found a company that solved those issues?

289
00:22:35,597 --> 00:22:37,205
Yes. We did.

290
00:22:37,287 --> 00:22:39,107
And which company would that be?

291
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:41,554
None other than Manbo Construction.

292
00:22:41,824 --> 00:22:45,050
Manbo Construction
developed its own gas boiler?

293
00:22:45,164 --> 00:22:46,933
To be precise,

294
00:22:47,048 --> 00:22:47,909
it's under development as we speak.

295
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:50,902
So tell us about your solution
to avoid any further accident.

296
00:22:51,022 --> 00:22:53,350
That is something I'm
not at liberty to reveal.

297
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:56,939
What I can tell you is that
the boiler we're developing...

298
00:22:57,043 --> 00:23:01,192
will not only deal with all the
inherent flaws of existing boilers,

299
00:23:01,318 --> 00:23:07,187
but also be based on our Korean-born
ondol culture instead of radiators.

300
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:19,004
It was a huge success, Chairman.

301
00:23:19,098 --> 00:23:22,330
All the reporters looked really shocked.

302
00:23:22,862 --> 00:23:26,512
More than the reporters, I'm curious
how Lee Gangmo reacted.

303
00:23:26,664 --> 00:23:28,837
Isn't that obvious?

304
00:23:29,025 --> 00:23:31,739
I will have dinner with
Cha Soojeong this evening.

305
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:33,129
Make a reservation with the hotel.

306
00:23:33,211 --> 00:23:35,419
Ahh... That...

307
00:23:35,725 --> 00:23:38,086
Tonight she has a radio broadcast, so...

308
00:23:38,192 --> 00:23:39,542
Director Moon.

309
00:23:39,726 --> 00:23:41,105
How long has this been going on?

310
00:23:41,187 --> 00:23:42,514
I apologize, Chairman.

311
00:23:42,643 --> 00:23:46,214
There seems to
be no convincing her, so...

312
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:51,207
Still, it's not like we could demand
the signing fee for breach of contract.

313
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:52,766
Do it.

314
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:53,389
What?

315
00:23:53,471 --> 00:23:56,079
If she breached our contract, she must pay.

316
00:23:56,666 --> 00:23:57,909
All right, Chairman.

317
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,530
No... Nevermind.

318
00:23:59,624 --> 00:24:01,244
I'll tell her myself.

319
00:24:01,515 --> 00:24:04,000
Check her schedule and set up
an appointment as soon as possible.

320
00:24:04,092 --> 00:24:05,498
Yes, Chairman.

321
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:12,298
Miju.

322
00:24:13,517 --> 00:24:15,529
If you keep this up,

323
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:20,345
you'll only force me
to retaliate even more.

324
00:24:32,909 --> 00:24:37,866
- Manbo Construction Chairman Jo Minwoo
Solves Fatal Flaw of Beaute Gas Boilers -

325
00:24:44,311 --> 00:24:46,343
What is so interesting?

326
00:24:46,719 --> 00:24:49,062
Look... Give this a read.

327
00:24:49,147 --> 00:24:52,138
Wow! The department store
is having a bargain sale!

328
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:55,951
Ahh... Not that, this one over here.

329
00:24:56,541 --> 00:24:58,303
Why are you acting all angry with me?

330
00:24:58,359 --> 00:25:00,426
Ahh... Really, sorry-ass cunt.

331
00:25:00,492 --> 00:25:02,359
Sorry-as...

332
00:25:04,417 --> 00:25:07,943
Gyeongja... Gyeongja!
I didn't mean you...

333
00:25:09,881 --> 00:25:17,463
But I'm really curious what this
solution they found really is?!

334
00:25:17,803 --> 00:25:19,568
Jo Minwoo, sorry-ass son of a cunt.

335
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:24,070
Guess he's trying to completely bring
us down at the next apartment sale?

336
00:25:24,239 --> 00:25:26,210
I brought him, President.

337
00:25:27,415 --> 00:25:28,994
Come on in.

338
00:25:29,487 --> 00:25:31,254
You've read the
newspaper, haven't you?

339
00:25:31,522 --> 00:25:32,020
Yes.

340
00:25:32,095 --> 00:25:34,447
We are now sure that
our core technology was stolen.

341
00:25:34,635 --> 00:25:38,337
Now the battle will
be fought on pure skills.

342
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:45,353
So you want us to develop
an ondol-based boiler of our own?

343
00:25:45,485 --> 00:25:47,994
And it must be much
more efficient than theirs.

344
00:25:48,069 --> 00:25:52,110
But they're already developing
their technology as we speak?

345
00:25:52,223 --> 00:25:56,063
From now on, you'll be in
charge of the boiler factory.

346
00:25:56,232 --> 00:25:59,737
You're telling me to act as factory manager?

347
00:25:59,841 --> 00:26:00,912
Yes.

348
00:26:01,504 --> 00:26:04,574
You will be in charge of the whole process.

349
00:26:04,681 --> 00:26:08,549
We will provide all the resources you need.

350
00:26:08,944 --> 00:26:12,190
Youngchul Hyungnim, you take care
of providing factory resources.

351
00:26:12,402 --> 00:26:14,436
All right, fine.

352
00:26:15,825 --> 00:26:17,742
You can do it, right?

353
00:26:17,847 --> 00:26:19,351
Then,

354
00:26:19,557 --> 00:26:24,229
I'll put my 30 year career
on the line and give it a try.

355
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:32,131
What now?

356
00:26:34,135 --> 00:26:36,566
Soojeong, what do we do now?

357
00:26:36,773 --> 00:26:40,998
Chairman Jo said it's a breach
of contract, and sent you this.

358
00:26:41,073 --> 00:26:42,454
What?

359
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:45,940
I told you not to rile him up, didn't I?

360
00:26:46,006 --> 00:26:49,352
Do you even have the money
to pay that signing fee?

361
00:27:03,178 --> 00:27:03,864
Chairman.

362
00:27:03,977 --> 00:27:06,110
Cha Soojeong is on the phone.

363
00:27:12,791 --> 00:27:14,276
Put her on.

364
00:27:21,643 --> 00:27:22,658
Yes.

365
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:27,789
I'd like to meet,
would that be possible?

366
00:27:33,126 --> 00:27:35,227
I'm a little busy now.

367
00:27:35,506 --> 00:27:38,540
See you at the Hangang
Hotel, eight o'clock.

368
00:27:56,818 --> 00:27:58,974
Wooju!

369
00:28:00,027 --> 00:28:02,122
Mommy...

370
00:28:04,178 --> 00:28:07,161
You missed me, didn't you?

371
00:28:08,665 --> 00:28:10,579
Come on in.

372
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:15,544
By the way, can you just
go around like that?

373
00:28:15,721 --> 00:28:19,421
There are only a few people
recognizing me on the street.

374
00:28:22,125 --> 00:28:28,212
So Wooju's father chose you
as model for his apartments?

375
00:28:28,564 --> 00:28:29,680
Yes.

376
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:32,123
Actually, that's the reason why I came.

377
00:28:32,229 --> 00:28:34,884
I think I'll have to use all my savings.

378
00:28:34,989 --> 00:28:37,949
Do I have a father?

379
00:28:39,853 --> 00:28:42,896
Where is he? Daddy.

380
00:28:44,795 --> 00:28:47,582
Wooju, that's not what she meant...

381
00:28:47,794 --> 00:28:51,781
We'll have to be
careful when he's around.

382
00:28:52,014 --> 00:28:53,590
I think so, too.

383
00:28:53,731 --> 00:28:57,349
I want to see my daddy...

384
00:28:58,206 --> 00:28:59,839
Sorry, Wooju.

385
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:01,883
Your father is up in heaven.

386
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,681
In heaven?

387
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:05,424
Yeah.

388
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,890
How much do you need?

389
00:29:23,784 --> 00:29:26,627
I need to pay 150 million won,

390
00:29:27,202 --> 00:29:30,080
so if we add the fifty million
for my model contracts,

391
00:29:30,209 --> 00:29:32,974
the thirty million
for my contract as a singer,

392
00:29:33,103 --> 00:29:35,817
and the ten million I've been saving,

393
00:29:35,946 --> 00:29:38,096
I'm still sixty million short.

394
00:29:38,272 --> 00:29:41,631
I think I could help you with that.

395
00:29:41,819 --> 00:29:43,440
No way, Mom.
Forget it.

396
00:29:43,487 --> 00:29:44,302
Miju...

397
00:29:44,385 --> 00:29:47,521
That money was left
to you by the chairman,

398
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,283
I could never use it for me.

399
00:29:49,389 --> 00:29:52,337
So just make a lot of
money and pay me back.

400
00:29:52,419 --> 00:29:54,226
That'll do it.

401
00:29:54,522 --> 00:29:58,077
First, I'll try to find it on my own.

402
00:30:21,503 --> 00:30:23,668
Since you're here, have a seat.

403
00:30:23,844 --> 00:30:26,746
Don't just stand there as if
you were looking at a monster.

404
00:30:32,532 --> 00:30:35,133
Sorry for sending you that certification.

405
00:30:35,332 --> 00:30:38,452
- Tomorrow, I'll...
- No need to apologize.

406
00:30:40,531 --> 00:30:44,102
I couldn't find the entire sum.

407
00:30:44,243 --> 00:30:46,874
I will pay the rest as soon as possible.

408
00:30:47,849 --> 00:30:50,396
Is this really necessary?

409
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:55,188
That's exactly what I wanted to ask you.

410
00:31:02,823 --> 00:31:06,180
How can you be so cruel to me?

411
00:31:06,873 --> 00:31:08,811
Let go of my hand.

412
00:31:10,562 --> 00:31:13,122
I don't want to hurt you, either.

413
00:31:14,121 --> 00:31:18,090
- So let's get this over with.
- It might be over for you,

414
00:31:18,383 --> 00:31:20,051
but it's not to me.

415
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:27,827
Because I had lost all the will to live,
and only regained it thanks to you.

416
00:31:30,714 --> 00:31:32,922
So no matter how much you hurt me,

417
00:31:33,028 --> 00:31:36,822
it will never be as painful as all the
time I spent living without you!

418
00:31:50,714 --> 00:31:52,946
Just go for tonight.

419
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:56,089
I'll let you go.

420
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:49,698
That money...

421
00:32:50,274 --> 00:32:52,854
is all we have left.

422
00:32:53,856 --> 00:32:55,348
Mom...

423
00:32:55,489 --> 00:32:59,082
J... Just... Just this once.

424
00:32:59,469 --> 00:33:02,515
If I can only make enough
to open a store somewhere,

425
00:33:02,656 --> 00:33:04,958
I'll never gamble again, Mom.

426
00:33:06,115 --> 00:33:08,036
I mean it, Mom.

427
00:33:08,251 --> 00:33:11,055
I swear to God.

428
00:33:11,442 --> 00:33:14,027
It's not something I wanted to do,

429
00:33:14,191 --> 00:33:16,015
but we can't live with this money alone.

430
00:33:16,098 --> 00:33:18,764
We can't do a thing with this little.

431
00:33:19,222 --> 00:33:24,426
Don't you worry, Mom.
I had this great dream last night.

432
00:33:24,823 --> 00:33:25,565
A hundred million.

433
00:33:25,706 --> 00:33:28,509
If I can only make that much,
we'll use that to start a business,

434
00:33:28,614 --> 00:33:30,212
and it'll be the end of our worries.

435
00:33:30,353 --> 00:33:31,610
Got it?

436
00:33:31,939 --> 00:33:34,499
So don't worry, Mom.

437
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:48,662
It's because you're so clueless that you
let Jeongyeon's mother steal Dad from you!

438
00:33:54,693 --> 00:33:56,240
You...

439
00:33:57,344 --> 00:34:01,584
What did you just say?

440
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:05,050
Jeongyeon's mother?!

441
00:34:05,144 --> 00:34:07,566
Yoo Gyeongok, that woman...

442
00:34:07,965 --> 00:34:10,831
is Jeongyeon's birth mother.

443
00:34:11,536 --> 00:34:15,647
Dad has been deceiving us all along.

444
00:34:16,472 --> 00:34:21,281
So how can I not feel sorry for you?

445
00:34:40,844 --> 00:34:41,713
Call.

446
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:44,438
- I'm dead.
- Full house.

447
00:34:44,497 --> 00:34:46,376
I'll have to take this.

448
00:34:46,494 --> 00:34:49,636
- Call.
- Flush.

449
00:34:50,965 --> 00:34:52,152
Just a moment.

450
00:34:52,375 --> 00:34:55,382
This, this, and this!

451
00:34:59,374 --> 00:35:00,530
Flush.

452
00:35:01,283 --> 00:35:03,055
Thank you.

453
00:35:23,266 --> 00:35:26,896
This, and I raise another five million.

454
00:35:28,032 --> 00:35:29,718
I'm dead.

455
00:35:30,466 --> 00:35:32,572
Five million,

456
00:35:33,257 --> 00:35:33,791
and ten more.

457
00:35:33,861 --> 00:35:37,267
Ten, and I raise another twenty.

458
00:35:37,595 --> 00:35:42,407
Twenty, and thirty more.

459
00:35:46,362 --> 00:35:47,927
You'll forgive me,

460
00:35:48,174 --> 00:35:51,075
but I put my life on the line here.

461
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,964
So it's all in.

462
00:35:58,711 --> 00:36:00,555
Call.

463
00:36:03,269 --> 00:36:05,901
Ace full house.

464
00:36:08,532 --> 00:36:11,293
Mom... I did it!

465
00:36:11,417 --> 00:36:12,820
I did it!

466
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:14,276
Mom...

467
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:16,073
Wait... Wait.

468
00:36:16,156 --> 00:36:17,389
Wait a moment.

469
00:36:17,506 --> 00:36:20,203
We're a little impatient, aren't we?

470
00:36:24,467 --> 00:36:26,476
I'm sorry.

471
00:36:29,606 --> 00:36:32,100
Hey! You cheated, right?

472
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:33,157
Let me go!

473
00:36:33,228 --> 00:36:36,646
No way... You changed that card!

474
00:36:41,748 --> 00:36:44,203
That is my money...

475
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:47,389
Give it back!
My money!

476
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:57,172
I'll never forgive you.

477
00:36:58,295 --> 00:37:01,342
You dare make my life so miserable?

478
00:37:02,329 --> 00:37:07,447
And you think I'd just
let you get away with it?

479
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:10,995
After you've turned me into this state.

480
00:37:13,005 --> 00:37:14,883
Dream on.

481
00:37:15,541 --> 00:37:20,201
I'll kill you and then
get it over with myself!

482
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:21,939
Only that...

483
00:37:23,125 --> 00:37:24,535
Only that...

484
00:37:25,275 --> 00:37:27,413
can bring me some consolation.

485
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,897
Only then...

486
00:37:34,401 --> 00:37:36,926
I won't feel so stupid.

487
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:04,323
Mom...

488
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:08,598
What do we do now?

489
00:38:12,192 --> 00:38:14,160
Mom...

490
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:18,341
What do we do...

491
00:38:42,227 --> 00:38:43,989
Mom.

492
00:38:51,589 --> 00:38:53,640
Mom, are you sleeping?

493
00:39:14,866 --> 00:39:16,475
Yes...

494
00:39:18,038 --> 00:39:19,936
That's right.

495
00:39:22,705 --> 00:39:24,059
What?!

496
00:39:24,858 --> 00:39:26,303
Mom.

497
00:39:26,678 --> 00:39:28,340
Mom!

498
00:39:28,605 --> 00:39:30,578
Mom...

499
00:39:42,798 --> 00:39:43,649
Mom.

500
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,792
Mom!
Mom!

501
00:39:46,649 --> 00:39:48,662
She's not dead, is she?
Right?

502
00:39:48,771 --> 00:39:49,913
She can't be dead!

503
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:53,342
- She lost her consciousness.
- So wake her up!

504
00:39:53,459 --> 00:39:55,516
Surgery... She needs
to go through surgery.

505
00:39:55,586 --> 00:39:57,794
- Do it! Now!
- Please, don't act like this.

506
00:39:57,877 --> 00:40:00,395
She regained her consciousness.

507
00:40:01,723 --> 00:40:02,874
Mom.

508
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:04,272
Mom.

509
00:40:04,836 --> 00:40:05,940
Can you hear me?

510
00:40:06,057 --> 00:40:06,727
Mom!

511
00:40:06,809 --> 00:40:08,736
Open your eyes, Mom!

512
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:12,395
Mom...

513
00:40:17,524 --> 00:40:19,462
Jeong...shik...

514
00:40:20,495 --> 00:40:21,987
Mom.

515
00:40:22,163 --> 00:40:26,738
I'm here.
Your son is here.

516
00:40:28,054 --> 00:40:30,603
Ohh... Tell me.
What is it?

517
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:34,440
What do you want me to do?
Tell me, Mom.

518
00:40:34,796 --> 00:40:36,805
My son...

519
00:40:37,368 --> 00:40:39,234
Mom...

520
00:40:40,948 --> 00:40:44,637
- My poor boy...
- Mom...

521
00:40:45,965 --> 00:40:48,067
You must live...

522
00:40:49,406 --> 00:40:52,350
a better life than Jeongyeon.

523
00:40:55,545 --> 00:40:58,917
Don't you ever let
them look down on you,

524
00:40:59,668 --> 00:41:04,509
and gain people's praise...

525
00:41:05,273 --> 00:41:07,763
Promise you will...

526
00:41:10,124 --> 00:41:16,314
live a much better life than Jeongyeon.

527
00:41:16,443 --> 00:41:20,266
Yeah... Mom... I promise.

528
00:41:20,865 --> 00:41:25,176
I will succeed at all cost, Mom.

529
00:41:25,376 --> 00:41:29,863
My poor boy...

530
00:41:55,046 --> 00:41:56,669
Mom.

531
00:41:57,528 --> 00:41:58,936
Mom.

532
00:42:00,064 --> 00:42:03,776
O... Open your eyes, Mom.

533
00:42:06,654 --> 00:42:09,853
What's wrong with you...
You're scaring me!

534
00:42:09,912 --> 00:42:12,343
Mom! Mom...

535
00:42:12,402 --> 00:42:15,887
Open your eyes... Mom...

536
00:42:16,651 --> 00:42:19,655
Mom...

537
00:42:19,702 --> 00:42:22,849
What's wrong with you, Mom...

538
00:42:22,954 --> 00:42:27,020
Mom!

539
00:42:58,884 --> 00:43:04,077
- Is this Oh Namsuk's...
- We accept no mourners.

540
00:43:04,288 --> 00:43:08,940
- Are you Hwang Jeongshik?
- I don't want to see anyone. Please leave.

541
00:43:09,151 --> 00:43:11,090
I'm a lawyer.

542
00:43:20,534 --> 00:43:27,191
This is the inheritance Oh Namsuk left
behind after selling her house and land.

543
00:43:31,749 --> 00:43:36,729
What is that supposed to mean?

544
00:43:40,851 --> 00:43:46,011
But if you tie all this up,
how will you make a living?

545
00:43:46,105 --> 00:43:50,510
I ruined my son's life.

546
00:43:51,344 --> 00:43:53,495
I am the first reason why that happened,

547
00:43:54,059 --> 00:43:56,056
and the second is money.

548
00:43:57,313 --> 00:43:59,838
If Jeongshik can only get a hold of himself,

549
00:44:00,202 --> 00:44:05,466
no matter how difficult life
will be, it won't be in vain.

550
00:44:05,719 --> 00:44:06,931
But, Ma'am...

551
00:44:07,025 --> 00:44:13,533
Once my son finally wakes
up, I'll give him that money.

552
00:44:26,449 --> 00:44:28,030
Mom...

553
00:44:29,242 --> 00:44:31,655
I'm sorry.

554
00:44:32,763 --> 00:44:35,496
Forgive me, Mom.

555
00:44:36,927 --> 00:44:40,007
Forgive me, Mom...

556
00:44:42,092 --> 00:44:44,805
I'm sorry...

557
00:45:04,235 --> 00:45:06,020
Namsuk.

558
00:45:08,005 --> 00:45:13,038
Was it all for this?

559
00:45:14,882 --> 00:45:17,643
If this was the end that awaited you,

560
00:45:19,769 --> 00:45:24,707
why did you live that way?

561
00:45:30,393 --> 00:45:32,424
It's my fault.

562
00:45:36,265 --> 00:45:41,927
I shouldn't have met you in the first place,

563
00:45:44,683 --> 00:45:50,983
and ignored you for so many years.

564
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:54,566
Still...

565
00:45:55,870 --> 00:45:59,088
What is this?

566
00:46:01,074 --> 00:46:06,577
You foolish brat...

567
00:46:25,542 --> 00:46:29,963
Yoo Gyeongok is now like a decaying tree.

568
00:46:30,069 --> 00:46:32,031
It's only a matter of
time before she collapses.

569
00:46:32,113 --> 00:46:35,978
But she's still supporting Hwang Taeseop.

570
00:46:36,154 --> 00:46:38,456
And I can't let that happen.

571
00:46:38,573 --> 00:46:40,782
I will bear that in mind, Congressman.

572
00:46:41,244 --> 00:46:44,685
How are the opposition
party members reacting?

573
00:46:44,791 --> 00:46:48,550
I did hear a strange rumor.

574
00:46:48,732 --> 00:46:49,572
About what?

575
00:46:49,666 --> 00:46:51,721
I can't speak with certainty,

576
00:46:51,886 --> 00:46:54,388
but it's about a certain ruling
party member organizing a...

577
00:46:54,494 --> 00:46:58,474
secret meeting with key
opposition party members.

578
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:02,703
And you don't know who
this ruling party member is?

579
00:47:02,867 --> 00:47:05,581
You know you can never
be sure with political rumors.

580
00:47:05,686 --> 00:47:10,357
It could just be a false alarm,
but considering the situation...

581
00:47:10,721 --> 00:47:14,327
A secret meeting with
key opposition members...

582
00:47:15,126 --> 00:47:17,828
I have a bad feeling about this.

583
00:47:25,818 --> 00:47:27,170
Yes.

584
00:47:27,816 --> 00:47:29,049
All right.

585
00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:30,741
Sure.

586
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:33,926
We set up a date.

587
00:47:34,035 --> 00:47:35,005
When is it?

588
00:47:35,127 --> 00:47:36,646
This Saturday,

589
00:47:36,749 --> 00:47:39,233
at the Shanghai Restaurant in Myeongdong.

590
00:47:39,358 --> 00:47:41,191
They couldn't have been
informed of the account, right?

591
00:47:41,273 --> 00:47:44,644
I'm sure he didn't tell them explicitly,

592
00:47:44,797 --> 00:47:48,035
but he likely suggested that
something like that might exist.

593
00:47:48,129 --> 00:47:53,215
Or else, he would have had
a hard time organizing all this.

594
00:48:10,910 --> 00:48:12,731
You were right.

595
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:15,967
Who is this ruling party member?

596
00:48:16,366 --> 00:48:18,668
I'm sure that day he will be revealed.

597
00:48:19,655 --> 00:48:25,328
We will find out for what, why
and by whom all this was organized.

598
00:48:25,439 --> 00:48:27,203
Wiretap?

599
00:48:27,731 --> 00:48:31,632
When you need material
evidence, nothing beats the wire.

600
00:48:35,931 --> 00:48:39,643
I can't smell any tear gas here.

601
00:48:39,772 --> 00:48:43,225
That's how the world should be...

602
00:49:00,228 --> 00:49:03,811
I told you his sniping
skills are second to none.

603
00:49:03,881 --> 00:49:05,772
Wow... I'm so envious.

604
00:49:05,855 --> 00:49:09,989
- It's a gift.
- Thank you.

605
00:49:10,212 --> 00:49:12,891
How could he be so good?!

606
00:49:14,812 --> 00:49:18,952
Hey... Why is it so hard to see
your superior these days?

607
00:49:19,057 --> 00:49:21,668
Chief Hong is really busy as of late.

608
00:49:21,762 --> 00:49:24,170
Is his wife giving birth this month?

609
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,685
It's not because of that.

610
00:49:25,791 --> 00:49:28,257
He's in charge of politicians, these days.

611
00:49:28,516 --> 00:49:29,608
Politicians who?

612
00:49:29,679 --> 00:49:32,521
I don't really know for sure,

613
00:49:32,721 --> 00:49:36,921
but you know that Chinese
restaurant, the Shanghai?

614
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:39,998
I hear they're bugging
the place or something.

615
00:49:40,386 --> 00:49:43,381
Ahh... Shanghai?
At the Jeil Hotel?

616
00:49:43,475 --> 00:49:46,625
Yes, that's the one.

617
00:49:59,615 --> 00:50:01,204
Get ready.

618
00:50:23,904 --> 00:50:25,079
Yes.

619
00:50:25,279 --> 00:50:26,618
It's me.

620
00:50:26,853 --> 00:50:29,402
Is Congressman Min with you?

621
00:50:30,788 --> 00:50:31,798
He is.

622
00:50:31,974 --> 00:50:33,502
Just listen.

623
00:50:33,713 --> 00:50:36,062
The ANSP learned of all this.

624
00:50:36,168 --> 00:50:38,153
Cancel today's meeting.

625
00:50:38,282 --> 00:50:40,106
They did what?

626
00:50:41,034 --> 00:50:44,934
You said that the opposition party
members know about the account, right?

627
00:50:45,075 --> 00:50:48,775
They bugged the place, so
you must stop them from mentioning it.

628
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,218
What?
They bugged it?!

629
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:52,721
What is the matter?

630
00:50:52,839 --> 00:50:54,953
We're heading that way,

631
00:50:55,129 --> 00:50:56,919
so turn the car around.

632
00:50:57,062 --> 00:50:57,925
All right.

633
00:50:58,031 --> 00:50:59,335
We'll do that.

634
00:50:59,523 --> 00:51:00,967
Turn the car around.

635
00:51:01,737 --> 00:51:02,988
Turn around?!

636
00:51:03,082 --> 00:51:04,761
What's the matter, Chairman Hwang?

637
00:51:05,563 --> 00:51:09,263
I think they might have
found out about our meeting.

638
00:51:09,419 --> 00:51:10,807
What?

639
00:51:11,970 --> 00:51:13,038
We're almost there.

640
00:51:13,132 --> 00:51:15,517
The agents must be
waiting by the main entrance.

641
00:51:15,634 --> 00:51:17,878
Let's take the underground parking lot.

642
00:51:17,984 --> 00:51:19,931
All right.

643
00:51:43,282 --> 00:51:44,505
They're late.

644
00:51:44,611 --> 00:51:47,700
But, should we really believe that?

645
00:51:47,794 --> 00:51:49,263
I can't say.

646
00:51:49,674 --> 00:51:55,324
Seeing as they called us
first, it shouldn't be a lie?!

647
00:51:56,357 --> 00:52:01,263
So they talked of an account
for the secret presidential fund?

648
00:52:03,683 --> 00:52:05,774
That's what I've heard.

649
00:52:05,879 --> 00:52:10,296
If that is indeed the truth...

650
00:52:10,893 --> 00:52:12,761
Yes.

651
00:52:24,582 --> 00:52:26,167
The place has been bugged.

652
00:52:26,296 --> 00:52:28,975
You must leave immediately.

653
00:52:34,851 --> 00:52:36,457
You failed?

654
00:52:36,636 --> 00:52:40,484
Details of our mission might
have been leaked beforehand.

655
00:52:40,577 --> 00:52:42,093
Does that make any sense?

656
00:52:42,234 --> 00:52:44,689
How could they possibly
find out about an ANSP mission?

657
00:52:44,771 --> 00:52:49,063
There's an even bigger problem than that.

658
00:52:49,671 --> 00:52:51,232
And what is that supposed to mean?

659
00:52:51,373 --> 00:52:55,907
This is what the opposition
party members talked about.

660
00:52:58,021 --> 00:53:01,850
But, should we really believe that?

661
00:53:02,285 --> 00:53:04,135
I can't say.

662
00:53:04,259 --> 00:53:09,859
Seeing as they called us first,
it shouldn't be a lie.

663
00:53:11,123 --> 00:53:15,732
So they talked of an account
for the secret presidential fund?

664
00:53:15,838 --> 00:53:18,239
That's what I've heard.

665
00:53:18,368 --> 00:53:21,668
If that is indeed the truth....

666
00:53:24,030 --> 00:53:26,179
This is where it ended.

667
00:53:27,354 --> 00:53:30,831
An account for the
secret presidential fund?!

668
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:35,435
Have you ever written any
account while handling that fund?

669
00:53:35,517 --> 00:53:37,549
Look, Chief Oh!

670
00:53:37,878 --> 00:53:42,260
I would never do anything other
than what the president ordered me to.

671
00:53:42,354 --> 00:53:46,307
But they did mention
the existence of such an account.

672
00:53:46,424 --> 00:53:49,525
- If it wasn't you, who...
- Wait.

673
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:56,595
I wasn't the only one
handling that secret fund.

674
00:53:57,146 --> 00:53:58,732
Lee Seongmo.

675
00:53:59,936 --> 00:54:02,185
Chief Lee Seongmo?

676
00:54:02,522 --> 00:54:03,829
That's right.

677
00:54:04,264 --> 00:54:08,446
The only one in possession of enough
detailed information to write that account...

678
00:54:09,103 --> 00:54:10,607
is Lee Seongmo.

679
00:54:10,689 --> 00:54:15,094
Then, it can only be him.

680
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:19,663
I know how fond of him you are.

681
00:54:20,239 --> 00:54:22,542
I don't want to believe this,

682
00:54:22,683 --> 00:54:27,429
but how do you think the opposition
party members learned of this wiretap?

683
00:54:28,432 --> 00:54:33,560
Capture Lee Seongmo
and get him to confess.

684
00:54:33,772 --> 00:54:41,434
Still, nobody can learn of this.
You understand what I mean?

685
00:54:43,847 --> 00:54:47,330
Should the president learn of this account,

686
00:54:47,471 --> 00:54:50,599
I will lose everything
I have accomplished so far.

687
00:54:50,858 --> 00:54:54,593
All his confidence in
me will vanish in a moment.

688
00:54:54,922 --> 00:54:56,226
All right.

689
00:54:56,367 --> 00:55:00,839
If Lee Seongmo betrayed me as you say,

690
00:55:01,724 --> 00:55:05,654
then report back to me.

691
00:55:08,027 --> 00:55:11,081
As I will deal with him firsthand.

692
00:55:27,497 --> 00:55:30,193
What do you think you're doing?

693
00:55:32,549 --> 00:55:34,463
Chief, what are you doing here?

694
00:55:34,769 --> 00:55:36,824
Where is Lee Seongmo?

695
00:55:37,388 --> 00:55:41,752
- What is this about...
- Where is he, you prick?

696
00:55:44,903 --> 00:55:52,172
I plan to quit my job at the
ANSP within the next three years.

697
00:55:53,883 --> 00:55:58,930
I'll just hand my resignation and run
an orchard in the outskirts of Seoul.

698
00:55:59,258 --> 00:56:00,832
Grapes should do it.

699
00:56:00,997 --> 00:56:06,165
Miju loves them, and we could
make wine out of that.

700
00:56:07,419 --> 00:56:08,925
Hyung.

701
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:11,673
Just be honest and tell me everything.

702
00:56:11,767 --> 00:56:12,472
Tell you what?

703
00:56:12,625 --> 00:56:14,880
Saying that you'll quit in three years,

704
00:56:15,021 --> 00:56:18,733
that can only suggest
you'll destroy Jo Pilyeon before that.

705
00:56:19,073 --> 00:56:22,317
Better be careful what I say to you...

706
00:56:25,378 --> 00:56:27,474
What have you planned?

707
00:56:29,729 --> 00:56:31,467
Gangmo.

708
00:56:32,102 --> 00:56:33,311
Leave this to me.

709
00:56:33,381 --> 00:56:36,435
You're my brother!

710
00:56:36,541 --> 00:56:40,864
Later... In due time,
I'll tell you everything.

711
00:56:41,016 --> 00:56:42,814
Must you really
hide it from me as well?

712
00:56:43,002 --> 00:56:45,504
That's what we
planned from the start.

713
00:56:45,915 --> 00:56:49,203
We promised that you'd worry about
your company, and I'd handle this.

714
00:56:57,211 --> 00:56:59,105
Let me make a call.

715
00:57:10,223 --> 00:57:11,628
It's me, Chanseong.

716
00:57:11,781 --> 00:57:15,650
Right as you were worrying,
I think they heard them talk about the account.

717
00:57:16,848 --> 00:57:20,231
They even came to your
office and looked everywhere.

718
00:57:20,478 --> 00:57:23,062
I suggest you find refuge somewhere.

719
00:57:23,203 --> 00:57:25,129
Listen well, Chanseong.

720
00:57:26,057 --> 00:57:29,105
As long as they don't find the
account, everything will be all right.

721
00:57:29,504 --> 00:57:32,452
Without material evidence,
they can't do anything.

722
00:57:34,682 --> 00:57:38,255
So don't worry about me and
take good care of that account.

723
00:57:39,564 --> 00:57:42,290
No... Running away won't solve a thing!

724
00:57:42,489 --> 00:57:46,178
I will handle this, so
you just worry about the...

725
00:57:52,973 --> 00:57:54,254
What is that all about?

726
00:57:54,359 --> 00:57:55,663
Running away?!

727
00:57:55,828 --> 00:57:57,613
And what about this account?

728
00:57:58,165 --> 00:57:58,870
Gangmo.

729
00:57:58,999 --> 00:58:02,864
Who did you just talk with?

730
00:58:07,098 --> 00:58:08,284
No way, Hyung!

731
00:58:08,367 --> 00:58:09,541
Don't go.

732
00:58:09,694 --> 00:58:12,525
If I don't, I'll have to hide
for the rest of my days.

733
00:58:12,701 --> 00:58:14,416
And all our plans will be ruined.

734
00:58:14,498 --> 00:58:16,624
But if they find
that account, you'll die!

735
00:58:16,695 --> 00:58:21,853
- They won't.
- You think they won't make you confess?

736
00:58:22,652 --> 00:58:24,003
You know who you're dealing with!

737
00:58:24,109 --> 00:58:25,624
I'll just resist.

738
00:58:25,976 --> 00:58:27,151
I will endure it to the end.

739
00:58:27,233 --> 00:58:28,654
Hyung!

740
00:58:29,030 --> 00:58:30,915
Gangmo...

741
00:58:33,778 --> 00:58:38,268
I'd never leave you
and Miju behind and die.

742
00:58:38,987 --> 00:58:40,829
I can't.

743
00:58:41,299 --> 00:58:42,979
Give me that account.

744
00:58:43,296 --> 00:58:43,848
What?

745
00:58:43,977 --> 00:58:48,413
I'll expose it.
Let me do it.

746
00:58:48,589 --> 00:58:51,244
Then, nothing will happen to you.

747
00:58:51,643 --> 00:58:52,959
I told you to leave this to me!

748
00:58:53,041 --> 00:58:55,226
So don't go there!

749
00:58:57,675 --> 00:59:00,508
Or you could have
done it before I found out.

750
00:59:02,364 --> 00:59:05,312
How can I let you go there?

751
00:59:11,528 --> 00:59:13,707
Gangmo, I swear.

752
00:59:14,588 --> 00:59:16,197
I won't die.

753
00:59:16,526 --> 00:59:18,851
I promise, I won't.

754
00:59:24,542 --> 00:59:26,394
Trust me.

755
00:59:27,845 --> 00:59:29,988
Until I see Jo Pilyeon dead,

756
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:33,794
I'm never going to die first.

757
01:00:01,106 --> 01:00:02,239
What is it?

758
01:00:02,533 --> 01:00:03,731
You came out for me?

759
01:00:03,825 --> 01:00:07,133
Chief Oh is waiting for you.

760
01:00:29,902 --> 01:00:31,653
Were you looking for me?

761
01:00:32,052 --> 01:00:34,213
Don't make a scene!

762
01:00:37,737 --> 01:00:40,991
If you cooperate,
this will end quickly.

763
01:00:41,510 --> 01:00:42,884
Follow me.

764
01:01:15,433 --> 01:01:19,422
Starting now, I'm not your older
colleague, but just the man questioning you.

765
01:01:19,598 --> 01:01:23,328
I ask the questions,
and you'll only speak to answer them.

766
01:01:24,879 --> 01:01:27,322
And let's start by fixing that posture.

767
01:01:27,888 --> 01:01:31,151
- Park Seonbae...
- Avoid all titles.

768
01:01:35,688 --> 01:01:37,657
First tell me the reason I'm here.

769
01:01:37,833 --> 01:01:41,463
Being treated like a criminal at my
workplace without knowing the reason...

770
01:01:42,364 --> 01:01:44,529
is just insufferable.

771
01:01:44,783 --> 01:01:47,043
There is a traitor within our ranks.

772
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:49,016
Then, I will catch him for you.

773
01:01:49,157 --> 01:01:50,402
Hey... Lee Seongmo.

774
01:01:50,484 --> 01:01:52,363
Park Seonbae!

775
01:01:54,410 --> 01:01:57,132
You're close with the chairman
of Daeyang Chemicals, right?

776
01:01:58,154 --> 01:02:00,997
Why did you take classified
department of defense files...

777
01:02:01,208 --> 01:02:03,885
and met Chairman Song in secret?

778
01:02:04,437 --> 01:02:06,809
Wh... What?!

779
01:02:07,127 --> 01:02:10,481
That is exactly what you call betrayal.

780
01:02:12,613 --> 01:02:17,825
Should I list all the
other "traitors" besides you?

781
01:02:18,104 --> 01:02:20,290
You really...

782
01:02:21,817 --> 01:02:25,858
I'm sure you're not the
one who suspects me, Chief Oh.

783
01:02:26,151 --> 01:02:31,157
It is clear that outside pressures are to blame.

784
01:02:31,721 --> 01:02:33,424
Who is it?

785
01:02:34,434 --> 01:02:37,606
Who is calling me a traitor?

786
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:45,742
Let's make this clear.

787
01:02:47,016 --> 01:02:50,640
If you can't prove any of your allegations,

788
01:02:50,817 --> 01:02:57,065
then whomever is responsible for
this, be that from the inside or out,

789
01:02:57,629 --> 01:03:00,847
will pay for what he did.

Is Min Honggi the one who's helping you?

796
01:03:58,742 --> 01:04:01,455
If Lee Seongmo ends up confessing,

797
01:04:01,551 --> 01:04:03,692
you will be the first to pay with your life.

798
01:04:03,795 --> 01:04:05,880
So give me that account, Chairman Hwang!

799
01:04:05,951 --> 01:04:07,830
It's too dangerous for
us to take a step forward.

800
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:12,203
- This is it.
- Against politicians?

801
01:04:12,308 --> 01:04:15,153
We just received data
regarding Cha Soojeong.

802
01:04:15,293 --> 01:04:17,325
Isn't this President Lee Gangmo?

803
01:04:17,442 --> 01:04:19,216
If you still call yourself a father,

804
01:04:19,298 --> 01:04:21,455
at least try to understand the
suffering your own son is going through.

805
01:04:21,514 --> 01:04:24,638
You'll soon find out how scary
and cruel the world can be.

806
01:04:24,756 --> 01:04:27,786
I told you I don't care whether
Lee Seongmo is killed or not!
