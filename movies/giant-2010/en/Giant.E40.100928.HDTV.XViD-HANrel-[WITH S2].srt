4
00:00:24,565 --> 00:00:27,510
Your boys are keeping
their mouths shut, I hope?

5
00:00:27,602 --> 00:00:28,274
Yes.

6
00:00:28,331 --> 00:00:30,928
Okay...

7
00:00:31,801 --> 00:00:33,529
I'm going.

8
00:00:45,736 --> 00:00:48,101
The hell are you looking at?

9
00:00:48,455 --> 00:00:50,800
What's the matter?
I'm done, anyway.

10
00:00:50,912 --> 00:00:52,416
If you want to play,
find some money and do it,

11
00:00:52,522 --> 00:00:54,985
stop drooling after other people's cards.

12
00:00:55,098 --> 00:00:56,500
Ehh... You lousy son of a...

13
00:00:56,613 --> 00:00:58,138
You little...

14
00:00:58,242 --> 00:01:00,386
I raise twenty more.

15
00:01:02,207 --> 00:01:03,718
<i>Call.</i>

16
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:07,049
Triple.

17
00:01:09,285 --> 00:01:10,718
<i>You'll have to forgive me.</i>

18
00:01:10,827 --> 00:01:12,672
Straight.

19
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:19,087
Ahh... Goddamn...
I haven't seen a full house in ages.

20
00:01:19,201 --> 00:01:22,714
Ehh... Lousy twat, 
the hell would you know anyway?

21
00:01:22,828 --> 00:01:24,584
You...

22
00:01:29,271 --> 00:01:31,127
Do you have anything left for me?

23
00:01:32,033 --> 00:01:33,492
Who's that?

24
00:01:34,738 --> 00:01:37,016
He's a Hangang Construction 
director, on paper.

25
00:01:37,242 --> 00:01:38,984
But he's really no one special.

26
00:01:39,197 --> 00:01:41,434
Hangang Construction?

27
00:01:42,157 --> 00:01:43,709
Then he must know 
Lee Gangmo quite well?!

28
00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:45,357
You think?

29
00:01:45,555 --> 00:01:48,234
He's one of the 
company's founding members.

30
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:53,663
<i>I said give me some more money!</i>

31
00:01:57,907 --> 00:02:02,508
Lee Gangmo is interfering with
your acquisition of that boiler company?

32
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:05,675
And where would he possibly
have found the money?

33
00:02:05,788 --> 00:02:07,484
I think he's being backed by Baekpa.

34
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:09,621
Baekpa?!

35
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,509
That old fart is always getting in the way.

36
00:02:12,622 --> 00:02:14,713
With Baekpa's resources,

37
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,388
any bidding war will be 
no foregone conclusion.

38
00:02:21,546 --> 00:02:23,075
Listen...

39
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:26,314
Would you be able to
convince Hwang Jeongyeon...

40
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:30,095
to present a joint acquisition
bid alongside Lee Gangmo?

41
00:02:30,747 --> 00:02:34,101
You want to drag Lee Gangmo to our side?

42
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:38,678
If we only manage to do that,
we'd solve all our problems with one strike.

43
00:02:38,782 --> 00:02:42,669
As you're well aware, my top priority
is bringing Hwang Jeongyeon down.

44
00:02:42,774 --> 00:02:45,011
There will be no changes to your plans.

45
00:02:45,119 --> 00:02:51,262
You will just join forces with Lee Gangmo
and present a higher bid than ours.

46
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:54,506
And once the bid is finalized,

47
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:58,576
you will take the deposit and
disappear at the last minute.

48
00:02:59,993 --> 00:03:04,454
Then, Lee Gangmo's contract
will be rendered null,

49
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,628
and Manbo Construction will win 
the acquisition as the second in line.

50
00:03:08,734 --> 00:03:10,168
That's exactly the plan.

51
00:03:10,294 --> 00:03:14,599
We will end up acquiring 
that boiler company,

52
00:03:15,442 --> 00:03:20,031
and you will still manage
to ruin Hwang Jeongyeon.

53
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:26,475
We will also be able to stop Lee Gangmo
from presenting impossibly high bids.

54
00:03:26,701 --> 00:03:28,046
How about it?

55
00:03:28,155 --> 00:03:31,947
Isn't this having
your cake and eating it?

56
00:03:32,056 --> 00:03:33,456
I understand.

57
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:36,090
I will try to make it happen.

58
00:03:47,028 --> 00:03:48,633
What are you trying to say?

59
00:03:48,727 --> 00:03:51,008
That we should make a joint bid 
along with President Lee?

60
00:03:51,121 --> 00:03:56,001
I think selling my real estate
overseas might take some time.

61
00:03:56,465 --> 00:04:01,643
Just in case, 
having him join forces with us...

62
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:04,514
But he's got no reason to do that.

63
00:04:04,627 --> 00:04:06,455
We're not completely out of options.

64
00:04:06,681 --> 00:04:09,585
I'll start by bringing it up,

65
00:04:10,095 --> 00:04:14,159
so I'd like you to try and convince him.

66
00:04:20,457 --> 00:04:22,767
<i>A joint acquisition?</i>

67
00:04:24,693 --> 00:04:26,633
I'm sure you're well aware...

68
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:32,419
that such a move would
bring us no benefit whatsoever?!

69
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,113
But if you take a look at this,
you might change your mind.

70
00:04:43,796 --> 00:04:46,261
<i>- Gas Boiler Business Plan -</i>

71
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:47,751
Isn't this a business plan?

72
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:50,784
Beaute gas boilers are
tailor-made for radiators,

73
00:04:50,909 --> 00:04:54,775
<i>{\a6}*underfloor heating via masonry floors</i>

74
00:04:50,909 --> 00:04:54,775
so they're not exactly
compatible with our ondol* culture.

75
00:04:54,936 --> 00:05:01,459
I've been researching to build a Korean-style
gas boiler suitable for our ondol floors for years.

76
00:05:01,813 --> 00:05:03,466
But I've repeatedly been
running into setbacks.

77
00:05:03,622 --> 00:05:10,717
So what you're saying is that you need
Beaute's core technology for your boilers?

78
00:05:10,859 --> 00:05:12,105
That's right.

79
00:05:12,526 --> 00:05:14,314
It's quite the concrete plan, I see.

80
00:05:14,456 --> 00:05:17,472
Yes, since it's been
a few years in the making.

81
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:23,868
Once the acquisition is complete,
I'll share all my findings with you.

82
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:26,559
It is certainly fascinating,

83
00:05:26,755 --> 00:05:29,406
but I don't think it's something
that can be decided on a whim.

84
00:05:44,151 --> 00:05:48,768
President Lee, may we have a word?

85
00:05:50,326 --> 00:05:51,607
It will only take a minute.

86
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,794
I think I saw a coffeehouse nearby?

87
00:05:56,026 --> 00:05:57,485
Sure.

88
00:06:02,809 --> 00:06:05,160
Did Lee Gangmo look
like he might fall for it?

89
00:06:05,362 --> 00:06:08,245
Hwang Jeongyeon must be
trying to convince him as we speak.

90
00:06:09,321 --> 00:06:14,760
If she's the one asking,
he won't be able to refuse.

91
00:06:23,203 --> 00:06:25,653
Lee Gangmo asked for a meeting.

92
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,854
He took the bait.

93
00:06:32,564 --> 00:06:36,158
Director Hwang and I
will take care of the deposit.

94
00:06:37,365 --> 00:06:40,432
So you said you'll be investing
about 300 million, right?

95
00:06:40,556 --> 00:06:41,619
Yes.

96
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:45,597
You will receive ten percent 
of company shares,

97
00:06:45,837 --> 00:06:49,165
and will be proclaimed directors as well.

98
00:06:49,321 --> 00:06:52,966
So are we presenting that bid 
in Hangang Construction's name?

99
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:55,985
Since you were the first
to propose this partnership,

100
00:06:56,095 --> 00:06:59,412
let's use your Taeyang Trading instead.

101
00:07:00,077 --> 00:07:02,017
Ahh... Well, that's fine with me.

102
00:07:02,131 --> 00:07:06,323
Kindly sign our joint venture agreement.

103
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:26,967
As we promised, I will present all
the necessary paperwork for this bid.

104
00:07:27,109 --> 00:07:31,187
What kind of bidding
price were you looking at?

105
00:07:34,459 --> 00:07:38,536
I can't disclose that information.

106
00:07:40,179 --> 00:07:43,592
Are you telling me that you
will keep it secret even to us?

107
00:07:43,734 --> 00:07:48,620
Manbo Construction must be trying
everything in its power to find that out.

108
00:07:49,512 --> 00:07:53,157
So I hope you'll understand.

109
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:57,934
Still, leaving us in the cold like this...

110
00:07:58,104 --> 00:07:59,605
Isn't that a bit excessive?

111
00:07:59,736 --> 00:08:03,783
I still haven't signed this agreement.

112
00:08:08,381 --> 00:08:10,905
If you disagree with my methods,

113
00:08:11,086 --> 00:08:16,156
we could just pretend no
agreement was ever signed.

114
00:08:19,441 --> 00:08:20,787
Fine.

115
00:08:20,971 --> 00:08:24,542
We're leaving it to your discretion
anyway, so do as you wish.

116
00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:27,130
Thank you, Director Han.

117
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:30,425
I never imagined
President Lee would do that.

118
00:08:30,946 --> 00:08:36,129
Would you be able to
find out that bidding price?

119
00:08:37,276 --> 00:08:42,300
I mean... I should at least have a
ballpark figure to start gathering those funds.

120
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:45,685
I know President Lee very well.

121
00:08:45,996 --> 00:08:48,786
He's never going to tell me.

122
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:11,586
I see you didn't come for the fish, 
but to lure some people...

123
00:09:11,756 --> 00:09:13,753
How did you know?

124
00:09:14,022 --> 00:09:16,988
There's this suspicious
fella hiding back there.

125
00:09:17,817 --> 00:09:20,692
Didn't you lure him here?

126
00:09:22,066 --> 00:09:24,162
He works for Jo Pilyeon.

127
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,437
Jo Pilyeon...

128
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:31,941
If you lure him well enough,
that sure would be a big fish in your net.

129
00:09:44,642 --> 00:09:48,069
So? You couldn't find his bidding price?

130
00:09:48,239 --> 00:09:49,823
I apologize, Congressman.

131
00:09:49,932 --> 00:09:52,303
He's so tight-lipped about this...

132
00:09:52,802 --> 00:09:55,762
Lee Gangmo met with Baekpa again.

133
00:09:55,888 --> 00:09:58,478
The two looked on particularly good terms.

134
00:09:58,662 --> 00:10:02,534
He'll do some heavy betting for sure.

135
00:10:02,803 --> 00:10:05,443
If it's a war fought with money,
we have no reason to fear them.

136
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:09,477
The real issue is that we
must end up second at all cost.

137
00:10:09,577 --> 00:10:14,938
Doesn't that mean we're pretty much forced 
to find out Lee Gangmo's bidding price?

138
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:19,473
I do have something in mind...

139
00:10:19,665 --> 00:10:21,004
Let's hear it.

140
00:10:21,183 --> 00:10:23,599
A certain Park Sotae works
for Hangang Construction.

141
00:10:23,874 --> 00:10:24,841
Park Sotae?

142
00:10:25,049 --> 00:10:28,695
He's selling raw materials under the table 
to fund his gambling escapades.

143
00:10:28,859 --> 00:10:30,586
So you want to use him?

144
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:34,792
According to my sources, he's one
of Hangang Construction's main men.

145
00:10:35,642 --> 00:10:38,276
He'll be more than capable of
finding out that price for us.

146
00:10:38,523 --> 00:10:40,854
What do you think, Minwoo?

147
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:45,272
It is true that betrayal for
Park Sotae is like second nature.

148
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:49,397
But because of his
close ties with Lee Gangmo,

149
00:10:49,652 --> 00:10:51,621
this could actually get us 
into even more trouble.

150
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:54,736
You don't need to worry about that.

151
00:10:55,671 --> 00:10:58,645
I'm a pro when it comes
to people's Achilles' heel.

152
00:10:58,815 --> 00:11:00,789
So you'll find his weak spot?

153
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:04,614
Nobody addicted to gambling
can resist money's temptation.

154
00:11:04,756 --> 00:11:07,149
You need to be prudent about that.

155
00:11:08,027 --> 00:11:10,123
I'll give it a look first.

156
00:11:13,947 --> 00:11:16,770
Jo Pilyeon is here as well.

157
00:11:16,921 --> 00:11:18,614
I know, Hyung.

158
00:11:19,141 --> 00:11:24,619
Looks like they're giving it their all 
to find out your bidding price.

159
00:11:26,729 --> 00:11:28,088
So tell me,

160
00:11:29,179 --> 00:11:33,783
why aren't you asking me to find out 
Manbo Construction's price as well?

161
00:11:33,925 --> 00:11:39,575
If they can't find our price first,
they won't easily decide theirs.

162
00:11:40,071 --> 00:11:43,947
I could throw some
misleading information their way.

163
00:11:44,131 --> 00:11:47,001
You could get into trouble again.

164
00:11:47,126 --> 00:11:48,937
Whatever your plans are,

165
00:11:49,187 --> 00:11:52,900
if you need any help,
I'll always be there for you.

166
00:12:09,965 --> 00:12:11,889
Get moving!

167
00:12:13,556 --> 00:12:15,301
Nothing missing, I hope?

168
00:12:19,185 --> 00:12:23,066
There you go. Get out of here.

169
00:12:25,926 --> 00:12:28,111
What the...

170
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,934
What is this?

171
00:12:37,677 --> 00:12:40,510
H...Hyungnim...

172
00:12:40,623 --> 00:12:43,597
What? "Hyungnim"?!

173
00:12:43,923 --> 00:12:47,166
Give me that money.

174
00:12:47,577 --> 00:12:48,837
Wh...What is wrong with you?

175
00:12:48,964 --> 00:12:54,096
Already forgot who helped us 
live like decent people?

176
00:12:54,432 --> 00:12:57,127
Do this to Gangmo, 
and you'll be punished.

177
00:12:57,269 --> 00:12:58,985
And who the hell is Gangmo?

178
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:03,514
What's so special about him,
to treat him like some kind of god?

179
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:06,164
You ungrateful twat.

180
00:13:06,568 --> 00:13:11,949
I always thought of you
as my little brother, you fool.

181
00:13:12,133 --> 00:13:20,078
I wanted to spend the rest of my days 
living a honest life with you.

182
00:13:20,874 --> 00:13:25,530
But was this all you amounted to?

183
00:13:26,164 --> 00:13:29,030
I'm afraid that's who I am,
so mind your business,

184
00:13:29,155 --> 00:13:31,776
and get out of the way.

185
00:13:32,005 --> 00:13:34,233
You can't go!

186
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:38,014
Go beg Gangmo for forgiveness.

187
00:13:38,122 --> 00:13:41,794
Ask for forgiveness,
and make a new start, Sotae.

188
00:13:41,893 --> 00:13:44,093
Ehh... The hell with you!

189
00:13:44,536 --> 00:13:45,741
<i>Sotae!</i>

190
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:47,174
<i>Stop there!</i>

191
00:13:47,317 --> 00:13:48,623
<i>Sotae!</i>

192
00:13:48,733 --> 00:13:50,527
<i>Stop there, you fool!</i>

193
00:13:50,659 --> 00:13:52,996
<i>Sotae!!</i>

194
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:58,487
How about it?
Was that good enough for you?

195
00:14:28,854 --> 00:14:31,169
The hell is this?

196
00:14:49,963 --> 00:14:52,725
<i>Ace house...</i>

197
00:15:08,485 --> 00:15:12,124
You're already down ten million tonight?!

198
00:15:13,134 --> 00:15:14,843
You can pay on time, right?

199
00:15:14,957 --> 00:15:18,027
Don't you worry about it.

200
00:15:18,186 --> 00:15:21,153
I'll be paying back the whole sum 
before the night is over.

201
00:15:25,969 --> 00:15:28,840
Tell our man to go all out 
on him right away.

202
00:15:28,964 --> 00:15:30,940
All right, Hyungnim.

203
00:15:33,695 --> 00:15:36,641
You'll pay it back tonight?

204
00:15:46,497 --> 00:15:50,886
Didn't you say you had
something to talk about?

205
00:15:53,818 --> 00:15:55,504
Gangmo.

206
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:01,849
From now on, I'll give my entire
salary back to the company.

207
00:16:02,038 --> 00:16:03,377
What's that supposed to mean?

208
00:16:03,493 --> 00:16:05,910
Don't get angry and just listen, uh?

209
00:16:06,037 --> 00:16:08,516
Sotae, that fool...

210
00:16:09,105 --> 00:16:13,826
Aigoo...
That useless, foolish twat...

211
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:19,194
He's selling aggregate behind our backs.

212
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:22,566
So that's theft.

213
00:16:25,024 --> 00:16:25,945
Embezzlement, maybe?

214
00:16:26,044 --> 00:16:30,648
So that's why I told you 
I'd give up my salary!

215
00:16:30,859 --> 00:16:34,456
Just take my money and 
pretend you sold that aggregate.

216
00:16:34,555 --> 00:16:36,351
<i>Uh? Gangmo.</i>

217
00:16:36,506 --> 00:16:39,056
Just as a favor to me.

218
00:16:39,507 --> 00:16:41,691
Don't fire Sotae.

219
00:16:41,807 --> 00:16:44,405
<i>He'll eventually wake up.</i>

220
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:46,965
I'll take responsibility, Gangmo.

221
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:49,525
From now on, you'll handle raw materials.

222
00:16:49,636 --> 00:16:52,000
Sotae will go back to office duty.

223
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:54,170
Right...

224
00:16:54,425 --> 00:16:57,527
So you're going to forgive him 
for what he did, right?

225
00:16:57,682 --> 00:17:01,410
I'll buy back the aggregate
he sold with my own money.

226
00:17:01,523 --> 00:17:04,282
- Would that do?
- Thanks, Gangmo!

227
00:17:04,933 --> 00:17:06,161
Aigoo!

228
00:17:06,296 --> 00:17:08,583
Thank you so much, Gangmo!

229
00:17:08,668 --> 00:17:11,019
- Let me pour you a drink.
- Sure!

230
00:17:12,251 --> 00:17:13,866
Thanks, Gangmo.

231
00:17:14,002 --> 00:17:16,358
<i>I'm so thankful...</i>

232
00:17:22,051 --> 00:17:25,636
It's her newly released album.

233
00:17:32,462 --> 00:17:34,558
Your name... Ahh.

234
00:17:34,643 --> 00:17:36,416
It's written here.

235
00:17:36,531 --> 00:17:37,697
Cha Soojeong?!

236
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:40,270
Yes, PD Seonsaengnim.

237
00:17:41,148 --> 00:17:42,833
Get up.

238
00:17:44,476 --> 00:17:47,369
Shall I sing you a song?

239
00:17:48,314 --> 00:17:49,211
Turn around.

240
00:17:49,304 --> 00:17:50,259
Excuse me?

241
00:17:50,365 --> 00:17:51,860
Are you deaf?

242
00:17:52,109 --> 00:17:54,630
I said turn around.

243
00:18:05,149 --> 00:18:06,566
Come here.

244
00:18:06,765 --> 00:18:08,081
What?

245
00:18:08,265 --> 00:18:09,303
What are you doing?

246
00:18:09,415 --> 00:18:11,706
Go sit next to him.

247
00:18:23,997 --> 00:18:30,091
You know, getting a spot on the radio
for a newcomer like you is no joke?!

248
00:18:32,796 --> 00:18:34,722
When I get to work in the morning,

249
00:18:34,934 --> 00:18:40,712
my desk is filled with tapes like that.

250
00:18:42,936 --> 00:18:45,865
Am I making myself clear?

251
00:18:48,967 --> 00:18:50,964
Pour me a drink.

252
00:18:51,445 --> 00:18:52,234
What?

253
00:18:52,347 --> 00:18:54,013
Serve me a drink.

254
00:18:54,107 --> 00:18:56,402
Why, you can't?

255
00:18:58,469 --> 00:19:00,476
Don't you want to become a singer?

256
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,226
Soojeong...

257
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:05,362
Come on, serve him that drink.

258
00:19:22,343 --> 00:19:26,686
That's right... You're not too bad?!

259
00:19:30,694 --> 00:19:33,898
- Are you crazy?
- Hey! Soojeong!

260
00:19:34,198 --> 00:19:35,902
I apologize...

261
00:19:37,256 --> 00:19:39,493
What do I have to see...

262
00:19:39,732 --> 00:19:42,579
I'm really sorry, PD Son.
I apologize.

263
00:19:42,792 --> 00:19:45,921
Ahh... Really...

264
00:19:48,757 --> 00:19:50,609
I apologize, Director.

265
00:19:50,768 --> 00:19:53,090
I can't do it.

266
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:55,912
You mean it?

267
00:19:56,107 --> 00:19:56,999
Yes.

268
00:19:57,084 --> 00:19:58,061
I won't do that.

269
00:19:58,146 --> 00:20:00,086
I quit.

270
00:20:03,628 --> 00:20:05,128
Director...

271
00:20:05,313 --> 00:20:06,888
Go back inside.

272
00:20:07,049 --> 00:20:09,074
Go back in, and tell that man
why you don't want to do it,

273
00:20:09,145 --> 00:20:13,507
and what he did wrong, got it?

274
00:20:14,577 --> 00:20:17,744
I have no intention of forcing you 
to do what he asked you.

275
00:20:17,869 --> 00:20:21,753
<i>But I can't tolerate the fact you
ran away as if you did anything wrong.</i>

276
00:20:21,847 --> 00:20:25,107
I'm putting my name on the line 
to help you become a singer.

277
00:20:25,202 --> 00:20:28,117
Who the hell are you
to disgrace me like that?

278
00:20:28,851 --> 00:20:31,556
Go get that tape back.

279
00:20:31,659 --> 00:20:33,766
If anyone throws it away, I will.

280
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:44,114
<i>What's with you?</i>

281
00:20:44,388 --> 00:20:46,572
Am I finally getting an apology?

282
00:20:48,094 --> 00:20:49,693
Give me back my tape.

283
00:20:49,892 --> 00:20:51,222
What?

284
00:20:52,729 --> 00:20:57,573
You don't deserve to listen to this.

285
00:20:57,856 --> 00:20:59,927
Didn't you come here to meet a singer?

286
00:21:00,036 --> 00:21:03,095
Have you been choosing singers this way, 
without ever listening to a song?

287
00:21:03,202 --> 00:21:04,763
Are you out of your mind...

288
00:21:04,856 --> 00:21:08,226
You might have the
power to choose singers,

289
00:21:08,335 --> 00:21:10,321
but I'm not going to let
people like you listen to my songs.

290
00:21:10,406 --> 00:21:12,120
I have every right to do so.

291
00:21:12,233 --> 00:21:15,533
Listen to this little brat...

292
00:21:16,907 --> 00:21:18,896
Listen, Director Yoo.

293
00:21:19,668 --> 00:21:23,529
Did you call me here just to
listen to this brat's excuses?

294
00:21:23,639 --> 00:21:25,590
This brat?!

295
00:21:25,901 --> 00:21:27,785
Have you completely
lost your eye for talent?

296
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:29,187
What?

297
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:31,283
You just wait.

298
00:21:31,986 --> 00:21:36,707
See what will become of
Cha Soojeong in just a year.

299
00:21:37,613 --> 00:21:41,675
I have no intention of letting
someone who can't tell gems from stones...

300
00:21:41,803 --> 00:21:44,069
handle someone like her.

301
00:21:44,777 --> 00:21:46,478
Let's go.

302
00:21:48,685 --> 00:21:50,753
<i>Hey, Cha Soojeong!</i>

303
00:21:52,113 --> 00:21:56,196
Don't ever dream of becoming a singer.

304
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:57,972
Is that clear?

305
00:22:13,664 --> 00:22:17,572
You must always be humble,
but never lose your dignity.

306
00:22:18,762 --> 00:22:22,586
You must never be afraid of making
bold decisions, if you want to make it.

307
00:22:24,738 --> 00:22:27,147
Yes, Director.

308
00:22:28,723 --> 00:22:30,295
Let's go.

309
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:41,729
So that's what happened.

310
00:22:41,939 --> 00:22:43,922
Yes, tell me about it.

311
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:49,030
We already had him write a
letter of apology for his conduct.

312
00:22:49,146 --> 00:22:53,921
I will make sure his actions 
don't affect the other PDs as well.

313
00:22:57,314 --> 00:22:58,764
Were you looking for me, Director?

314
00:22:58,873 --> 00:23:01,785
Who the hell do you think you are?

315
00:23:02,323 --> 00:23:02,998
What?

316
00:23:03,086 --> 00:23:06,502
The disciplinary committee
will terminate your contract soon!

317
00:23:06,714 --> 00:23:08,841
- But, Director...
- Shut your mouth!

318
00:23:08,937 --> 00:23:11,571
I've had it with you,
so get out of my sight!

319
00:23:21,314 --> 00:23:23,269
Right...

320
00:23:24,643 --> 00:23:28,367
Give this a listen.

321
00:23:30,217 --> 00:23:31,633
<i>Cha Soojeong?</i>

322
00:23:31,803 --> 00:23:34,607
She's my niece...

323
00:23:34,834 --> 00:23:37,338
She recorded an album?!

324
00:23:37,433 --> 00:23:39,725
If you like it, give me a call.

325
00:23:39,838 --> 00:23:40,866
Sure.

326
00:23:40,988 --> 00:23:46,440
These days we're facing difficulties 
trying to find new talents.

327
00:23:46,638 --> 00:23:49,216
It's not because she's my niece...

328
00:23:49,329 --> 00:23:52,252
I really think you'll fall
for her voice right away.

329
00:23:57,713 --> 00:23:59,397
Your song's still not on?

330
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:01,933
No, Mom.
Will be on in a minute.

331
00:24:02,032 --> 00:24:04,468
So Mommy's song is
coming out of this thing here?

332
00:24:04,596 --> 00:24:06,244
That's right, Wooju.

333
00:24:06,353 --> 00:24:09,736
Your mother's a singer.

334
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,076
The police is doing what
they can to find her,

335
00:24:20,161 --> 00:24:23,228
but because her address hasn't changed, 
looks like it might be difficult.

336
00:24:23,339 --> 00:24:27,315
If they really can't, file a missing
report and start printing leaflets.

337
00:24:27,425 --> 00:24:29,692
All right, Chairman.

338
00:24:30,451 --> 00:24:33,806
Should I turn off the radio?

339
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:41,329
<i>And now, debuting
singer Cha Soojeong with...</i>

340
00:24:41,433 --> 00:24:43,553
<i>"To you."</i>

341
00:24:47,107 --> 00:25:01,115
You're going to leave me anyhow.

342
00:25:01,384 --> 00:25:07,970
It must have finally come,

343
00:25:09,338 --> 00:25:16,144
Time to leave each other.

344
00:25:16,409 --> 00:25:29,803
My heart is telling me to hold onto you.

345
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:36,909
<i>But after going back
and forth a thousand times,</i>

346
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:43,137
<i>It is finally time to say goodbye.</i>

347
00:25:43,323 --> 00:25:50,286
<i>I guess it looks as if I'm laughing,</i>

348
00:25:50,456 --> 00:25:57,674
<i>But it hurts so much I feel like dying.</i>

349
00:25:57,782 --> 00:26:05,852
<i>The path leading me back to you
is disappearing far away.</i>

350
00:26:05,908 --> 00:26:15,779
<i>If we part ways like this,
we might never meet again.</i>

351
00:26:17,068 --> 00:26:22,379
Aigoo... Congratulations, Chairman.

352
00:26:22,577 --> 00:26:24,160
Forget Chairman.

353
00:26:24,271 --> 00:26:27,079
Just call me Director.

354
00:26:27,202 --> 00:26:29,956
But, Chairman. 
Director of what?

355
00:26:30,098 --> 00:26:31,853
Aigoo, you brat!

356
00:26:31,962 --> 00:26:33,879
Haven't you seen the sign outside?

357
00:26:34,049 --> 00:26:35,748
Doesn't it say "Urban
Development Research Center"?

358
00:26:35,847 --> 00:26:37,748
Ahh... Urban development.

359
00:26:37,873 --> 00:26:40,853
There's a realtor downstairs, 
so all the better!

360
00:26:40,924 --> 00:26:44,790
Aigoo... Enough! Stop with the
nonsense and let's get going.

361
00:26:44,946 --> 00:26:47,105
Aigoo... Right. Chairman.

362
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:48,801
Come down for lunch,

363
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:50,844
and if you need anything,
just give us a call.

364
00:26:50,953 --> 00:26:52,544
- Yes, yes...
- You too, Director Ju.

365
00:26:52,654 --> 00:26:55,805
Why is that butt of yours so heavy?

366
00:26:57,617 --> 00:27:00,691
Time to meet Jeongyeon now, 
don't you think?

367
00:27:01,063 --> 00:27:04,387
There is something
I must do before that.

368
00:27:04,812 --> 00:27:06,556
Find out how Baekpa
is doing these days.

369
00:27:06,665 --> 00:27:07,848
Baekpa?!

370
00:27:07,989 --> 00:27:13,513
I thought long and hard
where to make my first step.

371
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:16,066
It's Baekpa.

372
00:27:16,246 --> 00:27:18,941
If Baekpa agrees to help me,

373
00:27:19,154 --> 00:27:23,799
then my first step will leave an
enormously influential footprint.

374
00:27:24,238 --> 00:27:26,149
All right.

375
00:27:36,824 --> 00:27:43,352
I guess it looks as if I'm laughing,

376
00:27:43,437 --> 00:27:46,637
But it hurts so much I feel like dying.

377
00:27:46,737 --> 00:27:48,733
Have you seen Sotae around?

378
00:27:48,879 --> 00:27:50,753
I haven't seen him all day?

379
00:27:50,864 --> 00:27:52,940
He's not even at the site?

380
00:27:53,067 --> 00:27:59,665
Ahh... Really, not seeing him around 
automatically makes me nervous.

381
00:28:03,772 --> 00:28:05,888
What's wrong with you?

382
00:28:05,993 --> 00:28:07,327
Stay put!

383
00:28:07,398 --> 00:28:10,910
No... Please...

384
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,988
You know what happens
when that hardens, don't you?

385
00:28:29,101 --> 00:28:31,318
Don't kill me...

386
00:28:31,403 --> 00:28:34,235
It goes straight into the water, 
you along with it.

387
00:28:34,759 --> 00:28:36,837
And you won't come out of it 
even in a hundred years.

388
00:28:36,943 --> 00:28:38,073
I'll pay that money back!

389
00:28:38,186 --> 00:28:39,858
Isn't that all you need?

390
00:28:39,971 --> 00:28:41,708
I beg you, spare me...

391
00:28:41,811 --> 00:28:44,115
You're already down a hundred million...

392
00:28:44,242 --> 00:28:45,758
How are you going to pay that back?

393
00:28:45,885 --> 00:28:47,429
What... A hundred?!

394
00:28:47,514 --> 00:28:51,621
How can twenty million
suddenly become a hundred?

395
00:28:51,815 --> 00:28:55,260
Still does not know how
we run our business, does he?!

396
00:28:58,461 --> 00:29:00,183
Anyhow,

397
00:29:00,688 --> 00:29:04,347
if you don't pay back that money 
before that gets hard...

398
00:29:05,648 --> 00:29:07,619
<i>{\a6}slang is fishes, but it would be correct
anyway (same species/fish, several/fishes)</i>

399
00:29:05,648 --> 00:29:07,619
Guess you'll end up
sleeping with the fishes?!

400
00:29:07,723 --> 00:29:11,404
No... Please...

401
00:29:13,014 --> 00:29:15,445
<i>- Don't kill me!
- Shut it!</i>

402
00:29:16,708 --> 00:29:18,908
<i>I don't wanna die this way...</i>

403
00:29:19,017 --> 00:29:21,201
<i>Please!</i>

404
00:29:21,544 --> 00:29:24,212
I see there's a much bigger
price on your head, Park Sotae.

405
00:29:27,105 --> 00:29:29,735
Don't kill me... Please...

406
00:29:29,827 --> 00:29:34,265
I can't die this way...

407
00:29:39,391 --> 00:29:41,516
Park Sotae.

408
00:29:45,573 --> 00:29:48,652
<i>Doesn't it feel like, at this point,</i>

409
00:29:49,785 --> 00:29:51,570
I might be the only one 
who can save you?

410
00:29:51,711 --> 00:29:55,865
Please... Please help me...

411
00:29:55,958 --> 00:29:58,962
And if I do,
what will I get in return?

412
00:29:59,061 --> 00:30:01,058
Anything... I'll do anything you ask!

413
00:30:01,157 --> 00:30:04,904
Just let me live...

414
00:30:05,622 --> 00:30:08,728
You know I'm trying to
acquire a boiler company, right?

415
00:30:10,097 --> 00:30:12,821
I'll pay back the
hundred million for you,

416
00:30:13,029 --> 00:30:15,511
so find out your company's
bidding price for me.

417
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:19,728
How about it?

418
00:30:19,824 --> 00:30:21,865
Will you be able to?

419
00:30:27,902 --> 00:30:29,072
Throw him into the water.

420
00:30:29,165 --> 00:30:30,479
- Yes.
- Yes.

421
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:32,731
<i>I'll do it.</i>

422
00:30:33,383 --> 00:30:38,333
I will... 
I'll find out the bidding price.

423
00:30:39,409 --> 00:30:41,746
The bid is this Friday.

424
00:30:41,944 --> 00:30:43,913
You have until the day before
to find out. Is that clear?

425
00:30:44,012 --> 00:30:48,993
Instead, you must 
pay my debts at all cost.

426
00:30:49,093 --> 00:30:53,571
The day you bring me that
information, you'll get your cash.

427
00:30:54,066 --> 00:30:55,993
A hundred million.

428
00:31:24,907 --> 00:31:27,182
What are you staring at?

429
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:28,632
Uh?

430
00:31:29,288 --> 00:31:30,943
It's nothing...

431
00:31:31,057 --> 00:31:33,022
How do I look today?

432
00:31:33,095 --> 00:31:36,690
Went to Myeong-Dong
and got myself a new set.

433
00:31:39,453 --> 00:31:41,153
Why, nothing special?

434
00:31:41,549 --> 00:31:42,923
Yeah.

435
00:31:44,693 --> 00:31:46,253
What's going on?

436
00:31:46,365 --> 00:31:50,246
He'd usually be drooling by now?!

437
00:31:50,811 --> 00:31:52,511
Kinda feels bad?!

438
00:31:52,638 --> 00:31:54,677
<i>What's wrong with him?</i>

439
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:57,452
Good morning, everyone!

440
00:31:57,545 --> 00:31:58,810
President, good morning.

441
00:31:58,904 --> 00:32:02,175
All come to my office.
Let's have a meeting.

442
00:32:12,085 --> 00:32:16,787
We decided on our bidding price 
for the Beaute Boilers acquisition.

443
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:22,069
We will present a bid for 12.7 billion.

444
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:28,313
If it's that much, considering they'll be
transferring all the technology to us...

445
00:32:28,469 --> 00:32:30,403
That's quite a figure?!

446
00:32:30,495 --> 00:32:33,539
What if Manbo Construction
presents a higher bid?

447
00:32:33,666 --> 00:32:37,065
They'll think 12 billion 
will be sufficient.

448
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:38,552
I don't think there's
anything to be worried about.

449
00:32:38,708 --> 00:32:44,070
So we're acquiring the company
through that Taeyang Trading or something?

450
00:32:44,182 --> 00:32:47,443
It's a joint venture, 
so it doesn't matter much either way.

451
00:32:47,742 --> 00:32:51,933
We're the only ones
who know our bidding price.

452
00:32:52,669 --> 00:32:56,011
You must keep utmost secrecy 
until the day of the bid.

453
00:32:56,196 --> 00:32:58,611
Don't you worry, President.

454
00:32:58,838 --> 00:33:02,463
Is anyone of us ever going
to leak something like that?

455
00:33:03,596 --> 00:33:05,805
You can go back to work.

456
00:33:11,545 --> 00:33:13,211
Sotae.

457
00:33:18,648 --> 00:33:20,517
What's this?

458
00:33:24,568 --> 00:33:26,904
Thought you might need it.

459
00:33:37,224 --> 00:33:38,186
Yes.

460
00:33:38,386 --> 00:33:39,434
<i>It's me.</i>

461
00:33:39,547 --> 00:33:41,487
<i>You prepared my money, right?</i>

462
00:33:41,634 --> 00:33:43,526
Where are you now?

463
00:33:44,376 --> 00:33:48,166
I'll send someone your way, 
so wait there.

464
00:33:50,941 --> 00:33:52,924
Go to the Namsan Hotel
and bring back Park Sotae.

465
00:33:53,023 --> 00:33:56,904
I'll take him to my office to
avoid any unwarranted attention.

466
00:34:19,591 --> 00:34:21,070
The bidding price.

467
00:34:21,347 --> 00:34:23,939
First give me that briefcase.

468
00:34:44,537 --> 00:34:46,052
Speak.

469
00:34:46,463 --> 00:34:49,230
What will Lee Gangmo's price be?

470
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:53,109
Twelve...

471
00:34:54,044 --> 00:34:56,565
Twelve-point-seven billion.

472
00:34:59,553 --> 00:35:02,385
12.7 billion...

473
00:35:04,581 --> 00:35:07,984
Then, I'll take this...

474
00:35:09,145 --> 00:35:11,029
Write a receipt first.

475
00:35:11,156 --> 00:35:13,721
That will only be written
after all is said and done.

476
00:35:13,832 --> 00:35:14,549
What?

477
00:35:14,661 --> 00:35:18,298
Instead, that money 
is all yours until then.

478
00:35:18,403 --> 00:35:20,432
I can guarantee you that.

479
00:35:21,617 --> 00:35:26,545
After what he said,
think I'd try to steal it from you?

480
00:35:26,673 --> 00:35:29,633
You'll stay here until the bid is over.

481
00:35:30,464 --> 00:35:33,839
As if those 12.7 billion won 
turn out to be a lie,

482
00:35:34,609 --> 00:35:36,962
you won't get out of here alive.

483
00:35:37,415 --> 00:35:40,715
I'm 100 percent sure,
so don't worry about it.

484
00:35:40,842 --> 00:35:44,737
12.7 billion is quite the money...

485
00:35:45,157 --> 00:35:47,711
How much do you plan to answer with?

486
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:52,736
All the others will
reach 12.5 billion at best.

487
00:35:52,867 --> 00:35:55,505
Then, Manbo Construction?

488
00:35:55,731 --> 00:35:58,096
Our goal is ending second.

489
00:35:58,403 --> 00:36:01,750
With about fifty million
less than Lee Gangmo's side,

490
00:36:02,003 --> 00:36:04,342
it should be enough to end second.

491
00:36:06,055 --> 00:36:11,603
Until we acquire Beaute, just stay here.

492
00:36:37,567 --> 00:36:42,898
If you want to catch some fish,
you'll have to change bait more often.

493
00:36:43,096 --> 00:36:46,136
How have you been?

494
00:36:47,278 --> 00:36:49,034
Aren't you Chairman Hwang?

495
00:36:49,162 --> 00:36:51,098
When did you come back from the States?

496
00:36:51,214 --> 00:36:54,392
Yes... A few days ago.

497
00:36:54,628 --> 00:37:00,827
If you don't mind,
can I fish here with you?

498
00:37:01,054 --> 00:37:02,796
As you wish.

499
00:37:03,065 --> 00:37:05,104
Thank you.

500
00:37:14,104 --> 00:37:19,516
You don't seem to have too
much desire to catch fish?!

501
00:37:21,881 --> 00:37:24,642
I've already spent enough years 
being consumed by greed.

502
00:37:24,841 --> 00:37:27,237
What else could I possibly covet?

503
00:37:29,738 --> 00:37:36,989
I've also made enough money
to last for a few people.

504
00:37:37,273 --> 00:37:41,762
And I've also experienced
losing it all at once.

505
00:37:42,233 --> 00:37:45,035
<i>I survived a near-death experience,</i>

506
00:37:45,156 --> 00:37:53,379
and have done terrible things to
other people for the sake of personal gain.

507
00:37:54,002 --> 00:37:56,353
It's the frailty of human life.

508
00:37:56,551 --> 00:37:59,890
Desire is fruitless.

509
00:38:00,881 --> 00:38:03,893
So you feel the same way?

510
00:38:04,018 --> 00:38:09,633
Ever since I lost all dreams,
I suddenly feel like doing nothing.

511
00:38:09,883 --> 00:38:13,005
Wouldn't it mean my time has finally come?

512
00:38:13,179 --> 00:38:20,932
Allow me to make you a proposal.

513
00:38:21,187 --> 00:38:26,654
And what kind of proposal would
you make to a feeble old man like me?

514
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:32,515
I no longer have anything to lose now.

515
00:38:33,463 --> 00:38:37,654
Nor have I anything to show for.

516
00:38:47,739 --> 00:38:49,385
<i>Sir.</i>

517
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:53,965
Just this once,

518
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:59,837
allow me to roar at
the world one last time.

519
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:09,424
All I have left is that passion and
fire that guided my life all these years.

520
00:39:09,651 --> 00:39:16,902
Allow me to spout out that
raging fire one last time, Sir!

521
00:39:17,256 --> 00:39:25,567
What for and against whom 
will your last roar be?

522
00:39:27,139 --> 00:39:29,631
Jo Pilyeon, Sir.

523
00:39:30,155 --> 00:39:31,223
Jo Pilyeon?!

524
00:39:31,319 --> 00:39:32,662
Yes!

525
00:39:32,939 --> 00:39:35,953
That scumbag is not even human.

526
00:39:36,047 --> 00:39:40,170
He's a devil in disguise.

527
00:39:40,652 --> 00:39:47,095
I want to punish him
with my own hands, Sir!

528
00:39:50,742 --> 00:39:52,486
Get up now.

529
00:39:52,653 --> 00:39:54,282
Sir!

530
00:39:56,010 --> 00:40:01,292
You've suddenly thrown a dilemma at my feet.

531
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:06,218
A... dilemma?!

532
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:12,506
And what would this dilemma be?

533
00:40:12,709 --> 00:40:16,925
I suddenly feel the urge to do something.

534
00:40:17,151 --> 00:40:19,672
I have a newfound desire.

535
00:40:19,828 --> 00:40:22,941
That's all I'll say.

536
00:40:32,765 --> 00:40:36,476
<i>{\a6}*1985 foundation for the
victims of the Aung San bombing</i>

537
00:40:32,765 --> 00:40:36,476
We have the Ilhae Foundation*, 
the Peace Dam...

538
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:41,893
It's as if the closer to the end of his term
we get, the busier the president becomes.

539
00:40:45,335 --> 00:40:50,334
So where does the scope of your duties
really end, Congressman Jo?

540
00:40:50,504 --> 00:40:51,969
Are you curious?

541
00:40:52,147 --> 00:40:54,548
Why ask such things?

542
00:40:54,874 --> 00:40:56,373
I sure am!

543
00:40:56,482 --> 00:40:59,739
Just thought there was
no reason to hide it among peers...

544
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:05,085
Whatever the president
wishes for or plans to do,

545
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,747
it is all under my jurisdiction.

546
00:41:11,095 --> 00:41:14,655
No need to spell it out, I hope?!

547
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:19,955
Doesn't sound like
something I'd brag about?!

548
00:41:20,688 --> 00:41:21,506
What?

549
00:41:21,597 --> 00:41:25,718
For whose sake do you think
those people elected you?

550
00:41:25,809 --> 00:41:28,786
- Congressman Min...
- Go on the streets and take a look.

551
00:41:28,978 --> 00:41:32,788
Not only students, now even average
salarymen are joining the demonstrations!

552
00:41:32,873 --> 00:41:34,205
<i>Congressman Min, that's enough.</i>

553
00:41:34,292 --> 00:41:37,164
Isn't it because people like you 
keep misleading the president...

554
00:41:37,277 --> 00:41:39,160
that this country is
going to hell in a handbasket?

555
00:41:39,237 --> 00:41:41,927
Hey! Min Honggi!

556
00:41:42,153 --> 00:41:44,462
I said give it a rest!

557
00:41:45,581 --> 00:41:50,064
I call you here for my birthday,
and look at what I have to witness!

558
00:41:50,254 --> 00:41:52,463
I apologize, Congressman.

559
00:41:55,522 --> 00:42:00,827
But Baekpa said he
wanted to introduce someone...

560
00:42:01,007 --> 00:42:03,199
Why isn't he here yet?

561
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:05,976
He should be here any moment.

562
00:42:07,254 --> 00:42:09,051
I apologize.

563
00:42:09,221 --> 00:42:11,204
I'm a bit late.

564
00:42:17,741 --> 00:42:21,620
Aigoo... Chairman Hwang?!
When did you make your return?

565
00:42:21,923 --> 00:42:24,009
Are you feeling better?

566
00:42:24,108 --> 00:42:27,811
Yes... Well...
I'm fully recovered now.

567
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:31,861
It's been quite a long time, indeed.

568
00:42:32,173 --> 00:42:33,873
So, tell me...

569
00:42:34,856 --> 00:42:36,592
How come you two 
showed up here together?

570
00:42:36,748 --> 00:42:41,106
Hyungnim wanted to see me.

571
00:42:41,874 --> 00:42:43,574
Hyungnim?!

572
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:48,161
This fella and I have
vowed eternal friendship.

573
00:42:49,237 --> 00:42:52,225
We're now blood brothers.

574
00:42:54,836 --> 00:42:57,593
You never fail to amaze me, 
Chairman Hwang.

575
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:03,708
You two put together
make quite the impression.

576
00:43:19,518 --> 00:43:22,846
What on earth is wrong with him?

577
00:43:30,763 --> 00:43:33,512
Baekpa is trying to provoke me.

578
00:43:33,686 --> 00:43:35,645
What are you trying to say?

579
00:43:35,771 --> 00:43:38,499
Despite fully knowing
what went on between us,

580
00:43:38,593 --> 00:43:41,467
he took Hwang Taeseop under his wings.

581
00:43:43,974 --> 00:43:47,313
How is our Beaute
acquisition matter proceeding?

582
00:43:47,749 --> 00:43:51,112
Minwoo said he's got it all under control.

583
00:43:51,222 --> 00:43:52,720
Is that so?

584
00:43:54,296 --> 00:43:56,317
Once tomorrow's acquisition is over,

585
00:43:56,459 --> 00:44:00,410
I'll have to focus my attention
on Baekpa and Hwang Taeseop.

586
00:44:06,374 --> 00:44:07,896
Sotae?

587
00:44:08,130 --> 00:44:10,835
They're still keeping him confined.

588
00:44:12,732 --> 00:44:14,823
Will they be able to
find out by tomorrow?

589
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:17,094
We'll just have to trust Sotae.

590

My name is Cha Bucheol.

596
00:45:16,215 --> 00:45:18,382
I've heard a lot about you.

597
00:45:18,976 --> 00:45:21,953
So you're being of great help
to Chairman Jo, I hear?

598
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:25,216
I'm actually the one who's being helped.

599
00:45:25,442 --> 00:45:28,419
He's going to come in handy.

600
00:45:28,535 --> 00:45:32,499
To people like you, 
he could become rat poison,

601
00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:33,925
but it could also be the opposite.

602
00:45:34,081 --> 00:45:38,237
I never forgive people who commit sins.

603
00:45:38,449 --> 00:45:41,206
I'm sure you're not the type?!

604
00:45:42,514 --> 00:45:44,262
Of course not.

605
00:45:44,372 --> 00:45:46,245
Here, let me pour you a drink.

606
00:45:46,569 --> 00:45:48,773
So tomorrow's bid should go as planned?

607
00:45:48,858 --> 00:45:51,537
It's already game over.

608
00:45:51,778 --> 00:45:53,524
You just wait.

609
00:45:53,697 --> 00:46:00,473
I'll make him pay back tenfold for what he
made me go through with the Suseo project.

610
00:46:13,331 --> 00:46:16,409
President Lee Gangmo
told me to give this to you.

<i>- Watermelon Apple
Plum Peach Apricot Melon -</i>

612
00:46:22,979 --> 00:46:24,484
How about Park Sotae's whereabouts?

613
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:27,001
I already found out
where they're keeping him.

- Ehh...

622
00:46:49,262 --> 00:46:51,228
Ahh... really!

623
00:46:51,382 --> 00:46:53,167
You flushed your manners
down the toilet, didn't you?

624
00:46:53,294 --> 00:46:55,164
Hey... I'm hungry.
Order something.

Yes!

626
00:46:56,098 --> 00:47:00,320
Hey... Wait. Forget this,
and let's go eat down the street.

627
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:02,949
You can't take a step
outside this place.

Who ever delivers in the morning?

And yesterday I spent
all day eating jjajangmyeon.

630
00:47:07,232 --> 00:47:08,714
Aren't you tired of that?

631
00:47:08,806 --> 00:47:11,415
Also, if you have any
brains up there, think about it.

632
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,985
Think I'd leave my money
here and run away?

633
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:15,952
Would you do that?
Of course not!

634
00:47:16,051 --> 00:47:19,476
If I was going to do that,
I wouldn't have even shown up.

635
00:47:20,312 --> 00:47:22,488
I'll treat you!

636
00:47:24,164 --> 00:47:27,190
Ahh... Let's go.

637
00:47:30,107 --> 00:47:32,240
This place is filled.

638
00:47:32,344 --> 00:47:33,124
Wait a moment.

639
00:47:33,223 --> 00:47:36,166
Let's get ourselves
some beers and fruit.

640
00:47:36,279 --> 00:47:38,392
Ajumma, we'd like some fruit.

641
00:47:38,548 --> 00:47:39,426
What should I give you?

642
00:47:39,525 --> 00:47:43,202
Let's see, I don't know how
much money I have left...

643
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:49,897
Watermelon (100), Apple (10), Plum (1)...

644
00:47:50,069 --> 00:47:52,452
Ohh Ohh...

645
00:47:52,564 --> 00:47:56,980
A watermelon, two apples, and...

646
00:47:57,496 --> 00:47:58,964
Six plums.

647
00:47:59,035 --> 00:48:01,230
The hell are you, setting up shop?

648
00:48:01,315 --> 00:48:04,185
Let me think, what's wrong with you?

649
00:48:04,302 --> 00:48:06,509
How much do I have left here?

650
00:48:06,618 --> 00:48:08,354
Ahh... Right!

651
00:48:08,496 --> 00:48:11,047
Wow, look at those peaches.
Five of those, please.

652
00:48:11,141 --> 00:48:13,552
Five. Yes...

653
00:48:43,549 --> 00:48:45,852
Had sweet dreams last night?

654
00:48:47,904 --> 00:48:49,932
Can you interpret them for me?

655
00:48:50,099 --> 00:48:53,229
I dreamed of eating really tasty fruit.

656
00:48:55,792 --> 00:48:59,205
But, why is Lee Gangmo not around?

657
00:49:09,711 --> 00:49:12,445
You're better off eating fruits than meat.

658
00:49:12,586 --> 00:49:14,948
- Enough with that...
- Just listen.

659
00:49:15,045 --> 00:49:17,574
Vegetables as well, you know?

660
00:49:17,645 --> 00:49:22,049
- Then you'll get a lot healthier than you think.
- Worry about yourself.

661
00:49:27,289 --> 00:49:28,773
- Ma'am.
- Yes.

662
00:49:28,879 --> 00:49:30,189
Some fruit, please.

663
00:49:30,282 --> 00:49:31,435
What can I give you?

664
00:49:31,546 --> 00:49:33,373
You know what those folks just bought?

665
00:49:33,443 --> 00:49:34,605
The same exact amount.

666
00:49:34,690 --> 00:49:35,525
Uh?!

667
00:49:35,582 --> 00:49:37,692
We have no time.
Please.

668
00:49:37,862 --> 00:49:40,029
<i>Yes... Yes.</i>

669
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:44,504
<i>- Beaute Boilers Korean Subsidiary Sale Bid -</i>

670
00:50:00,950 --> 00:50:05,659
It should start any minute,
where on earth is President Lee?

671
00:50:22,642 --> 00:50:24,611
Ohh... It's me Hyung, go ahead.

672
00:50:24,823 --> 00:50:26,367
<i>Write it down.</i>

673
00:50:26,594 --> 00:50:28,336
<i>One watermelon.</i>

674
00:50:28,499 --> 00:50:30,177
<i>One watermelon.</i>

675
00:50:30,347 --> 00:50:31,409
<i>Two apples.</i>

676
00:50:31,522 --> 00:50:33,276
Two apples...

677
00:50:33,365 --> 00:50:35,969
- Six plums.
- Six plums...

678
00:50:36,067 --> 00:50:37,655
<i>Five peaches.</i>

679
00:50:37,767 --> 00:50:39,884
<i>Five peaches.</i>

680
00:50:40,011 --> 00:50:41,569
Is that all?

681
00:50:42,348 --> 00:50:44,476
All right.
Thanks, Hyung.

682
00:50:45,598 --> 00:50:49,422
<i>12.65 billion...</i>

683
00:50:50,088 --> 00:50:53,019
12.65 billion?!

684
00:51:01,928 --> 00:51:04,821
We will now start
the Beaute acquisition bid.

685
00:51:04,948 --> 00:51:10,316
We ask every president to please
come forward and convey their bids.

686
00:51:36,488 --> 00:51:37,705
What is going on?

687
00:51:37,790 --> 00:51:39,390
He didn't even tell us the price.

688
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:41,075
Wait.

689
00:51:41,411 --> 00:51:45,550
President Lee could
never be so irresponsible.

690
00:52:12,411 --> 00:52:13,877
I'll just have to write it down myself.

691
00:52:14,196 --> 00:52:15,753
Wait...

692
00:52:21,202 --> 00:52:24,020
Thought you'd given up.

693
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:26,088
Think that would be possible?

694
00:52:26,272 --> 00:52:30,294
We're still talking about
a fight against you, after all.

695
00:52:30,617 --> 00:52:34,075
I don't want to lose any
battle against you, either.

696
00:53:05,168 --> 00:53:07,710
Now that all we have to
wait for are the results,

697
00:53:07,965 --> 00:53:10,515
can you finally 
tell us our bidding price?

698
00:53:11,676 --> 00:53:13,998
I presented a 12.7 billion won bid.

699
00:53:15,811 --> 00:53:18,077
Don't you think that's a bit excessive?

700
00:53:18,259 --> 00:53:21,264
That's the idea, 
to make sure we win that bid.

701
00:53:21,434 --> 00:53:23,642
Wise decision.

702
00:53:24,096 --> 00:53:28,429
12.7 billion should be more
than enough to secure a win.

703
00:53:40,919 --> 00:53:44,483
The company which will acquire the 
Korean subsidiary of Beaute Boilers,

704
00:53:44,590 --> 00:53:47,787
presenting a bid of 12.7 billion won,

705
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:51,257
is Taeyang Trading.

706
00:54:10,808 --> 00:54:13,673
Tell them to let Park Sotae go.

707
00:54:13,853 --> 00:54:15,822
Yes, Chairman.

708
00:54:19,093 --> 00:54:21,019
<i>Here is the contract.</i>

709
00:54:21,173 --> 00:54:22,662
You have all the time to read it,

710
00:54:22,775 --> 00:54:24,956
and if we can confirm the
deposit has been wired by five,

711
00:54:25,041 --> 00:54:27,528
we'll then proceed to sign the contract.

712
00:54:44,354 --> 00:54:45,901
Ahh...

713
00:54:47,162 --> 00:54:50,334
Since we promised we'd
take care of the deposit,

714
00:54:50,428 --> 00:54:52,232
I'll go get it ready.

715
00:54:53,011 --> 00:54:55,322
So you wired the 300
million to my account, right?

716
00:54:55,475 --> 00:54:56,070
Yes.

717
00:54:56,225 --> 00:54:59,350
Go ahead,
we'll be waiting here.

718
00:54:59,423 --> 00:55:00,919
Then...

719
00:55:06,882 --> 00:55:09,097
If the money is not wired by 5,

720
00:55:09,205 --> 00:55:10,988
then the contract will be null.

721
00:55:11,362 --> 00:55:15,203
After which he'll be accused of fraud.

722
00:55:15,621 --> 00:55:17,740
You informed the police already, right?

723
00:55:17,862 --> 00:55:19,344
Of course.

724
00:55:19,522 --> 00:55:22,666
By 5, detectives will
be swarming the place.

725
00:55:23,176 --> 00:55:25,810
But if they end up losing him...

726
00:55:25,952 --> 00:55:27,379
<i>No need to worry.</i>

727
00:55:27,493 --> 00:55:30,037
The man I put on his trail 
is never going to fail.

728
00:55:34,555 --> 00:55:36,339
Good job, Jeongyeon.

729
00:55:37,066 --> 00:55:40,234
Thanks to you, I escaped
from a surefire fraud.

730
00:55:40,531 --> 00:55:44,097
And thanks to you, I will
acquire that boiler company.

731
00:55:44,279 --> 00:55:48,247
Not to mention ruining the Jo's plans.

732
00:56:05,236 --> 00:56:08,253
I will withdraw 300 million.

733
00:56:08,470 --> 00:56:09,739
300 million?!

734
00:56:09,858 --> 00:56:11,664
In 10,000 won bills, please.

735
00:56:11,949 --> 00:56:13,930
Please, come this way.

736
00:57:35,633 --> 00:57:36,897
Yes?

737
00:57:36,984 --> 00:57:38,749
<i>It's me, Director Yoo.</i>

738
00:57:38,858 --> 00:57:41,541
<i>Can I talk with Baekpa?</i>

739
00:57:41,753 --> 00:57:43,467
He's sleeping.

740
00:57:43,711 --> 00:57:46,069
<i>Then, convey him a message.</i>

741
00:57:46,484 --> 00:57:49,915
<i>I snatched all of
Hwang Jeongyeon's money.</i>

742
00:57:51,522 --> 00:57:55,012
I won this test.

743
00:57:55,502 --> 00:57:58,391
And I'm afraid 
Hwang Jeongyeon will no longer...

744
00:57:58,519 --> 00:58:00,799
<i>Mister Cha Bucheol?</i>

745
00:58:02,229 --> 00:58:03,307
And you are?

746
00:58:03,418 --> 00:58:06,024
You're under arrest for fraud.

747
00:58:07,301 --> 00:58:08,662
Get him!

748
00:58:08,737 --> 00:58:10,620
Let go, you prick!

749
00:58:10,875 --> 00:58:13,155
<i>I said let go!</i>

750
00:58:13,405 --> 00:58:14,401
Hello?

751
00:58:14,515 --> 00:58:15,379
Are you listening?

752
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:20,363
<i>I said let me go!</i>

753
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:28,266
What are you doing?

754
00:58:51,888 --> 00:58:55,213
Why is there still no news 
from Cha Bucheol?

755
00:58:55,336 --> 00:58:58,369
Director Moon is at the Beaute offices.

756
00:58:58,470 --> 00:59:03,004
Once Lee Gangmo's contract is
rendered null, we'll get our call.

757
00:59:08,172 --> 00:59:08,962
Yes.

758
00:59:09,047 --> 00:59:10,664
<i>It's me, Chairman.</i>

759
00:59:10,919 --> 00:59:12,014
How did it go?

760
00:59:12,166 --> 00:59:15,259
<i>Lee Gangmo's side couldn't
wire the deposit on time.</i>

761
00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:17,845
<i>The bid was invalidated, Chairman.</i>

762
00:59:19,162 --> 00:59:20,365
Yes.

763
00:59:20,762 --> 00:59:22,319
I see.

764
00:59:26,639 --> 00:59:28,225
We made it.

765
00:59:40,986 --> 00:59:43,866
Sotae, that's not how you act 
with friends, you twat...

766
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:48,191
Know how I felt, thinking
you had betrayed us again?

767
00:59:48,296 --> 00:59:51,698
Listen to you...
Think I'm still the old Park Sotae?

768
00:59:51,790 --> 00:59:56,493
Come hell or high water, I'm never
going to betray Gangmo again.

769
00:59:56,596 --> 00:59:58,671
Shideok, when did you find out?

770
00:59:58,793 --> 01:00:00,419
At first I didn't know,

771
01:00:00,547 --> 01:00:03,429
and Gangmo only told me 
after Sotae disappeared.

772
01:00:03,539 --> 01:00:05,832
Then I was the last to know?!

773
01:00:05,988 --> 01:00:09,130
You twats have no shame, all right...

774
01:00:09,236 --> 01:00:10,732
Why, did anything happen?

775
01:00:10,844 --> 01:00:12,632
Why are you all taking
it out on Director Park?

776
01:00:12,731 --> 01:00:16,654
Aigoo... Looks like she
has even less of a clue?!

777
01:00:16,928 --> 01:00:19,288
There's no time, let's hurry.

778
01:00:19,685 --> 01:00:21,172
Go faster.

779
01:00:25,569 --> 01:00:27,943
I hear you couldn't pay the deposit?

780
01:00:32,475 --> 01:00:36,268
So what are you doing here?

781
01:00:36,610 --> 01:00:38,678
The boat has already sailed.

782
01:00:39,032 --> 01:00:41,278
Just to congratulate you.

783
01:00:41,619 --> 01:00:44,492
You did the same to me last time,

784
01:00:45,016 --> 01:00:47,976
and you know that debts
should always be paid back.

785
01:00:59,948 --> 01:01:02,851
As Taeyang Trading defied
a few contractual obligations,

786
01:01:03,007 --> 01:01:07,766
the acquisition will be won by
the second highest bidder.

787
01:01:08,672 --> 01:01:12,855
<i>The new owner of Beaute
Boilers' Korean subsidiary,</i>

788
01:01:14,643 --> 01:01:19,288
with a bid of
twelve-point-six-five...

789
01:01:19,670 --> 01:01:22,786
<i>-one (12.651) billion won,</i>

790
01:01:23,164 --> 01:01:26,440
is Hangang Construction.

791
01:01:42,633 --> 01:01:44,458
You...

792
01:01:44,918 --> 01:01:47,566
Didn't you bid in
Taeyang Trading's name?

793
01:01:49,654 --> 01:01:51,560
<i>Hangang Construction
Taeyang Trading</i>

794
01:02:09,203 --> 01:02:12,418
Congratulations, President Lee Gangmo.

795
01:02:14,287 --> 01:02:16,045
Thank you.

796
01:02:16,612 --> 01:02:18,453
<i>President.</i>

797
01:02:25,989 --> 01:02:28,295
I brought the deposit.

798
01:02:28,826 --> 01:02:32,388
Let's go sign the contract.

799
01:02:33,935 --> 01:02:36,069

You know how many times I risked death?

808
01:03:13,338 --> 01:03:16,064
Everyone come at me,
you stinking piles of shit!

809
01:03:16,164 --> 01:03:18,189
Ohh... That's so cool...
Stinking piles...

810
01:03:18,281 --> 01:03:20,852
I'll have to handle 
Jo Pilyeon firsthand.

811
01:03:20,947 --> 01:03:22,384
<i>I have a secret weapon against him.</i>

812
01:03:22,525 --> 01:03:23,915
<i>Let me join in.</i>

813
01:03:24,005 --> 01:03:25,377
I want to enter politics.

814
01:03:25,472 --> 01:03:28,360
This is serious.
A boiler exploded.

815
01:03:28,473 --> 01:03:29,366
<i>Again?!</i>

816
01:03:29,495 --> 01:03:32,538
This Cha Soojeong is your sister.

817
01:03:32,694 --> 01:03:35,084
<i>Your death will not put an end to this.</i>

818
01:03:35,176 --> 01:03:40,132
Since your fortune will still be here,
ready for me to snatch it all.

819
01:03:40,274 --> 01:03:42,087
Even if this spells my demise,

820
01:03:42,186 --> 01:03:46,619
the dagger of vengeance 
will pierce Jo Pilyeon's heart.
