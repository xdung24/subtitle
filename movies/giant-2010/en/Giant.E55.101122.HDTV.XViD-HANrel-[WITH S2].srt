Episode 55

4
00:00:05,972 --> 00:00:07,455
Come on in, President Noh.

5
00:00:07,551 --> 00:00:09,424
- Have a seat.
- Yes.

6
00:00:13,962 --> 00:00:15,314
Is everything ready?

7
00:00:15,457 --> 00:00:18,511
The moment results of the
selection come out later today,

8
00:00:18,612 --> 00:00:21,015
we will set things in motion right away.

9
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:23,790
I'm sure you're confident
that you'll succeed?!

10
00:00:26,506 --> 00:00:28,657
- Director Moon.
- Yes.

11
00:00:32,603 --> 00:00:37,933
Anyhow, I thank you all for
completing our boiler on time.

12
00:00:38,765 --> 00:00:41,389
But, what now?

13
00:00:41,482 --> 00:00:44,479
We had no time to
do any performance tests.

14
00:00:44,568 --> 00:00:47,391
So I guess you won't even be
able to produce any test results?

15
00:00:47,486 --> 00:00:50,879
We didn't even have time
to write performance reports.

16
00:00:51,167 --> 00:00:52,058
How about Manbo Construction?

17
00:00:52,231 --> 00:00:53,741
I've asked at City Hall,

18
00:00:53,841 --> 00:00:56,813
and looks like they annexed
performance reports as well.

19
00:00:56,891 --> 00:01:00,158
Ahh... Jo Minwoo, that son of a cunt.
If only he hadn't set the factory on fire...

20
00:01:00,246 --> 00:01:05,148
Here... If you're all
done eating, let's get up.

21
00:01:11,853 --> 00:01:13,729
How about that?

22
00:01:15,886 --> 00:01:17,425
Would that be enough to reassure you?

23
00:01:17,533 --> 00:01:20,084
So the prototype Lee
Gangmo is about to present...

24
00:01:20,242 --> 00:01:23,945
is nothing but an incomplete product
which didn't go through any performance tests.

25
00:01:24,132 --> 00:01:27,468
Not to mention the fact that the factory
it was produced in was destroyed in a fire.

26
00:01:27,702 --> 00:01:31,105
Overcoming this handicap in
consumer confidence won't be easy.

27
00:01:31,211 --> 00:01:34,208
So I guess there's no
need to wait for the results.

28
00:01:34,332 --> 00:01:36,770
I'll head to the stock exchange right away.

29
00:01:36,866 --> 00:01:40,229
We should go to
City Hall as well, Chairman.

30
00:01:45,822 --> 00:01:48,267
- Manbo Boilers -

31
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:51,804
Gently... Gently!

32
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,660
Gently.

33
00:01:53,732 --> 00:01:55,845
Push it forward.

34
00:01:55,932 --> 00:01:57,672
That should do it.

35
00:01:57,815 --> 00:02:00,432
Will this do?

36
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:02,479
What?

37
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:14,166
Right.

38
00:02:14,324 --> 00:02:16,049
Here it is.

39
00:02:16,657 --> 00:02:20,521
Aigoo, Congressman Jo,
what brings you here?

40
00:02:20,737 --> 00:02:24,781
My son told me he was developing
a brand new Korean-styled boiler,

41
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,858
so I came to have a look.

42
00:02:26,966 --> 00:02:30,158
But tell me, what are you doing here?

43
00:02:30,288 --> 00:02:34,113
The New City concession
selection will grant priority...

44
00:02:34,271 --> 00:02:36,093
based on the results of
this boiler development selection.

45
00:02:36,187 --> 00:02:38,354
Of course I should be here.

46
00:02:38,728 --> 00:02:42,227
But I'd like you not to forget that
Hangang Construction was already...

47
00:02:42,342 --> 00:02:45,551
added to the list of ailing
companies to be forced out.

48
00:02:45,643 --> 00:02:47,045
But don't you forget, either.

49
00:02:47,156 --> 00:02:52,118
That today's results could completely
turn that list upside down.

50
00:02:58,792 --> 00:03:00,978
That old fart...

51
00:03:01,325 --> 00:03:05,536
keeps trying to test my patience.

52
00:03:17,624 --> 00:03:20,649
You should have accepted
my offer to share our technology...

53
00:03:20,757 --> 00:03:22,987
in a co-production while you still could.

54
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,539
That tenacity and self-righteousness of yours...

55
00:03:26,712 --> 00:03:28,821
will only bring you closer to failure,
as you'll witness today.

56
00:03:28,961 --> 00:03:31,774
You talk as if the winner
has already been decided.

57
00:03:31,952 --> 00:03:34,598
What could you possibly use to defeat us?

58
00:03:34,957 --> 00:03:36,091
Your technology?

59
00:03:36,295 --> 00:03:37,574
Capital?

60
00:03:38,236 --> 00:03:41,327
Or else, your company image?

61
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:47,143
There is not a single
thing you can use to beat us.

62
00:04:01,311 --> 00:04:03,252
Just a moment.

63
00:04:23,402 --> 00:04:26,590
If I was Lee Gangmo,
I would have tried to stop you...

64
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:30,457
from pouring water
into a bottomless pit, Miss Hwang.

65
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,119
So I was wondering.

66
00:04:33,374 --> 00:04:38,842
Will you keep your undying
loyalty for him if he fails once again?

67
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:42,667
Don't delude yourself, Jo Minwoo.

68
00:04:42,925 --> 00:04:44,881
Because I didn't make
this investment to help Gangmo,

69
00:04:45,044 --> 00:04:47,058
but merely to make a profit.

70
00:04:47,225 --> 00:04:48,857
I'm sure you did.

71
00:04:49,231 --> 00:04:53,084
It must be because you don't have a
clue that you so blindly bought their shares.

72
00:04:53,214 --> 00:04:55,931
I know you were the
one who set that factory on fire.

73
00:04:56,435 --> 00:04:59,914
Isn't that all I need to know?

74
00:05:15,586 --> 00:05:17,355
- Hangang Construction 7010 won -

75
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:32,672
If things go well, Hangang Construction
shares might even go up today.

76
00:05:32,779 --> 00:05:36,334
They're announcing the boiler
concession results today, right?

77
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:39,823
Then, shouldn't
we send someone there?

78
00:05:39,952 --> 00:05:46,193
There's no need. If President Noh
Gapsoo starts buying, we can just follow him.

79
00:05:46,351 --> 00:05:47,943
I guess that'll do it.

80
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:51,383
When it comes to
information, he's second to none.

81
00:05:56,267 --> 00:05:58,208
Aigoo...

82
00:05:59,143 --> 00:06:02,483
Are you going to sell all your
Hangang Construction shares as well?

83
00:06:02,607 --> 00:06:04,043
I don't know.

84
00:06:04,233 --> 00:06:08,085
We'll see whether I'll sell or buy more.

85
00:06:08,245 --> 00:06:12,998
What everyone knows already
is not called "information," it's just news.

86
00:06:13,587 --> 00:06:18,739
If you want, I could give you precious
intel well ahead of the curve?!

87
00:06:18,951 --> 00:06:20,672
There's no need.

88
00:06:21,395 --> 00:06:25,773
I was taught by Baekpa to make
the stock market move.

89
00:06:25,887 --> 00:06:28,596
Make the stock market move...

90
00:06:29,842 --> 00:06:32,962
Sounds just like him, all right.

91
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:40,390
The boiler we will select...

92
00:06:40,597 --> 00:06:46,569
will be proclaimed as the official boiler
used in every New City apartment.

93
00:06:46,842 --> 00:06:50,718
Also, I must also announce
that results of this selection...

94
00:06:50,831 --> 00:06:59,852
will significantly impact the
New City concession as well.

95
00:07:00,413 --> 00:07:01,811
Then, for starters,

96
00:07:01,949 --> 00:07:06,020
we will listen to Manbo Boilers' briefing.

97
00:07:06,265 --> 00:07:08,407
Chairman Jo Minwoo.

98
00:07:26,993 --> 00:07:29,496
The Manbo Boiler we just developed...

99
00:07:29,623 --> 00:07:32,631
not only solved many of the existing
flaws plaguing today's boilers,

100
00:07:32,816 --> 00:07:34,398
but it also manages to
retain most of the advantages...

101
00:07:34,498 --> 00:07:36,440
of conventional ondol-based heating systems.

102
00:07:36,612 --> 00:07:42,975
Particularly when it comes to the gas leak
accidents which so often affect Beaute boilers,

103
00:07:43,198 --> 00:07:49,328
we developed the world's first electronically
controlled gas exhaust mechanism.

104
00:07:53,237 --> 00:07:58,615
An electronically controlled mechanism would
be an epochal improvement in terms of safety?

105
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:01,698
Have you conducted
sufficient performance tests?

106
00:08:08,608 --> 00:08:10,422
{\a6}- Performance Test Report -

107
00:08:09,516 --> 00:08:14,088
Here is a report of around 120 tests
performed throughout the last three months.

108
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:19,089
As you can see, the success rate
is approximately 98.7 percent.

109
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:22,287
What happened to the remaining 1.3 percent?

110
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:24,615
They're negligible errors
occurred during preliminary tests.

111
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,059
Of course we improved
upon those minor faults as well.

112
00:08:28,265 --> 00:08:33,264
{\a6}[*approx. 45,000 square meters]

113
00:08:28,265 --> 00:08:33,264
A 15,000 pyeong* boiler factory
is about to be completed in Yongin.

114
00:08:33,552 --> 00:08:36,080
Once Manbo Boilers is enabled to
produce in such large quantities,

115
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:42,737
we will achieve the impressive feat
of exporting our products to Europe and America.

116
00:09:01,093 --> 00:09:03,039
Now that's interesting.

117
00:09:03,383 --> 00:09:07,455
Everyone in this room is looking at you.

118
00:09:07,569 --> 00:09:12,722
I'll treat you to an even more
interesting spectacle in a moment.

119
00:09:23,636 --> 00:09:24,662
It's me.

120
00:09:25,016 --> 00:09:26,857
How did it go?

121
00:09:28,741 --> 00:09:30,509
All right.

122
00:09:47,084 --> 00:09:48,895
- Hangang Construction 1405 won -

123
00:10:08,384 --> 00:10:10,112
- Hangang Construction 1380 won -

124
00:10:14,585 --> 00:10:20,380
In jargon, this is referred
to as "selling climax."

125
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:24,184
When investors panic and sell all
their shares, leaving no one to buy them.

126
00:10:24,306 --> 00:10:27,697
Selling climax.

127
00:10:29,268 --> 00:10:32,943
You really don't know much
about the stock exchange, do you?

128
00:10:36,911 --> 00:10:39,212
Thank you for waiting.

129
00:10:40,995 --> 00:10:44,010
I'm Lee Gangmo of Hangang Construction.

130
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:49,392
First, as a fellow competitor,

131
00:10:49,486 --> 00:10:53,985
I only have words of praise for
Manbo Construction's impressive achievements.

132
00:10:55,005 --> 00:10:58,397
Instead of the previously
announced forced exhaust type,

133
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:04,604
one of our new technologies is exactly
this automatic flame adjustment system.

134
00:11:05,482 --> 00:11:13,232
That is, the possibility for the customer
to choose their desired temperature at all times.

135
00:11:15,475 --> 00:11:19,276
Considering that our country is forced
to satisfy all its energy needs via imports,

136
00:11:19,435 --> 00:11:25,433
I believe this new technology
will help people significantly cut costs.

137
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:29,083
Could you show us any test reports?

138
00:11:29,342 --> 00:11:31,656
We still haven't completed
our performance tests,

139
00:11:31,814 --> 00:11:34,499
but we still haven't
encountered a single failure.

140
00:11:34,617 --> 00:11:38,159
And of all new technologies a factory
destroyed in a fire could come up with,

141
00:11:38,272 --> 00:11:40,327
a flame adjustment mechanism...

142
00:11:40,542 --> 00:11:44,369
Will customers truly show
confidence in such a product?

143
00:11:44,491 --> 00:11:48,981
You'll forgive us, but even this
jury has no confidence in that.

144
00:11:49,082 --> 00:11:52,346
Not to mention the fact that
you have no test reports, either.

145
00:11:52,993 --> 00:11:57,896
Deputy, I think we can
wrap up this conference.

146
00:11:58,414 --> 00:12:00,513
If that is what you think,

147
00:12:00,657 --> 00:12:02,641
I will bring this briefing to an end.

148
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:08,980
But may I show you one
last thing before we leave?

149
00:12:10,935 --> 00:12:12,057
Yes...

150
00:12:12,307 --> 00:12:14,128
Go ahead.

151
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:28,174
Let's suppose we're
facing the possibility of a fire.

152
00:12:28,455 --> 00:12:31,489
It could be a malfunction of the boiler itself,

153
00:12:32,654 --> 00:12:37,454
or maybe someone else
deliberately engaging in arson.

154
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,439
The boiler we developed,

155
00:13:31,825 --> 00:13:36,340
as you noted, was produced in
a factory which was destroyed in a fire.

156
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:43,790
And that is the very reason why
we developed this fire alarm system you see.

157
00:13:45,397 --> 00:13:50,899
The flame adjustment system which
lets customers choose their desired temperature,

158
00:13:51,013 --> 00:13:55,383
along with this fire alarm that warns
them of any possible accidents,

159
00:13:55,685 --> 00:14:02,644
are two of the revolutionary new
technologies of Hangang Construction's boiler.

160
00:14:32,132 --> 00:14:35,223
Thanks for setting my factory on fire.

161
00:14:35,703 --> 00:14:37,438
Listen well.

162
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:41,131
That is what will lead
you to your downfall.

163
00:14:50,928 --> 00:14:52,337
Jina.

164
00:14:52,462 --> 00:14:56,133
Buy all the Hangang
Construction shares you can.

165
00:15:02,186 --> 00:15:03,861
- Hangang Construction 995 -

166
00:15:08,229 --> 00:15:09,505
Yes... Taeyang Securities.

167
00:15:09,605 --> 00:15:13,784
What?! You want to buy
Hangang Construction shares?

168
00:15:15,357 --> 00:15:16,902
Hangang Construction shares?

169
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,385
You want to buy
Hangang Construction shares?

170
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:23,419
- Hangang Construction 1050 -

171
00:15:25,288 --> 00:15:29,443
Seems like you're behind this?

172
00:15:30,953 --> 00:15:33,753
Need to make the market
move, don't you think?

173
00:15:34,098 --> 00:15:38,570
Moving the stock market was
only possible for someone like Baekpa.

174
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:41,345
It's not something you can do.

175
00:15:43,172 --> 00:15:47,198
I'll keep those words in mind.

176
00:15:48,975 --> 00:15:50,844
We will announce the results.

177
00:15:51,098 --> 00:15:54,396
The company entrusted
with boiler production for...

178
00:15:54,554 --> 00:15:57,013
both the Suseo and New City apartments...

179
00:16:06,506 --> 00:16:11,518
The jury chose the
winner via unanimous vote.

180
00:16:12,272 --> 00:16:14,658
Unanimous!

181
00:16:16,096 --> 00:16:19,677
And they selected the Hangang-Beaute Boiler.

182
00:16:51,947 --> 00:16:53,208
Congrats, Gangmo.

183
00:16:53,401 --> 00:16:55,386
Thanks, Jeongyeon.

184
00:16:57,298 --> 00:17:01,640
But didn't President
Lee say their tests failed?

185
00:17:01,856 --> 00:17:04,013
But how could they...

186
00:17:09,501 --> 00:17:11,514
Jo Minwoo.

187
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:17,855
Stop trying to make
criminals out of honest people.

188
00:17:19,509 --> 00:17:22,198
The restaurant owner.

189
00:17:25,121 --> 00:17:27,652
This is not too bad, either.

190
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:31,362
Because if your foe
crumbles after the first strike,

191
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,425
it's not much fun.

192
00:17:45,186 --> 00:17:47,469
You were so confident about this,
what the hell did just happen?

193
00:17:47,581 --> 00:17:51,139
And what have you been doing
while that announcement was delayed?

194
00:17:51,326 --> 00:17:52,036
What?!

195
00:17:52,129 --> 00:17:54,216
If Hangang Construction
had been part of that list,

196
00:17:54,331 --> 00:17:57,412
then we wouldn't have
had to go through all this.

197
00:17:57,772 --> 00:18:03,092
So stop making stupid mistakes
like this and focus on politics.

198
00:18:03,753 --> 00:18:08,412
Are you trying to lecture me?

199
00:18:08,612 --> 00:18:10,569
You just wait.

200
00:18:10,772 --> 00:18:14,242
If those M&As go according to plan,

201
00:18:14,445 --> 00:18:16,617
it'll be only a matter of time
before Manbo Construction...

202
00:18:16,746 --> 00:18:18,889
becomes a giant in the financial world.

203
00:18:24,784 --> 00:18:29,903
That little fool is showing
hostility right in my face now?!

204
00:18:30,022 --> 00:18:31,184
Try to understand him, Congressman.

205
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:35,613
These days he's quite irritable.

206
00:18:50,282 --> 00:18:51,878
- Hangang Construction 1390 -

207
00:18:51,989 --> 00:18:55,372
Trading is closed for today.

208
00:19:02,152 --> 00:19:03,187
Wait there!

209
00:19:03,302 --> 00:19:04,381
How do you explain this, President Noh?

210
00:19:04,481 --> 00:19:06,279
Is it true that Hangang
Boilers won the concession?

211
00:19:06,351 --> 00:19:09,658
Did you spread false
information to con us all?

212
00:19:09,744 --> 00:19:11,010
You people...

213
00:19:11,139 --> 00:19:13,267
Have I ever told you to buy or sell anything?

214
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:15,841
- You told us to trust you!
- Be honest.

215
00:19:15,956 --> 00:19:18,465
This is all a trick, isn't it?

216
00:19:29,178 --> 00:19:33,178
Did you find out which
companies President Noh was investing in?

217
00:19:33,288 --> 00:19:35,045
Yes, Director.

218
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:43,343
How is our matter in the US proceeding?

219
00:19:43,485 --> 00:19:44,809
Everything is ready.

220
00:19:44,918 --> 00:19:46,893
I also found a nurse for him.

221
00:19:47,224 --> 00:19:49,165
No need to waste any more time.

222
00:19:49,411 --> 00:19:53,396
I'll have to go get Wooju
and bring him there right away.

223
00:19:54,302 --> 00:19:56,442
Are you going to do it yourself?

224
00:19:56,549 --> 00:20:00,802
It's where my grandson will be
living, of course I'll have to see it.

225
00:20:01,219 --> 00:20:04,260
Devise a plan on how to get that boy.

226
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:06,302
All right, Congressman.

227
00:20:14,064 --> 00:20:15,298
We did it!

228
00:20:15,361 --> 00:20:16,971
We did!

229
00:20:17,043 --> 00:20:19,545
Folks, that'll be all for today.

230
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,224
Thank you everyone.

231
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:23,942
Thank you.

232
00:20:25,905 --> 00:20:27,293
Stop shooting.

233
00:20:27,402 --> 00:20:30,007
I'd like to have a word.

234
00:20:30,216 --> 00:20:31,610
Go ahead first.

235
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,581
All right.

236
00:20:32,661 --> 00:20:34,390
You'll treat us tonight, right?

237
00:20:34,488 --> 00:20:35,490
Of course.

238
00:20:35,576 --> 00:20:39,314
But forget the samgyeopsal today,
how about beef and...

239
00:20:39,473 --> 00:20:41,020
All right.

240
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:43,096
Let's go.

241
00:20:46,777 --> 00:20:48,459
Is anything wrong?

242
00:20:48,704 --> 00:20:51,752
You told me Cha
Soojeong is your sister, right?

243
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:52,738
Yes.

244
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,658
Why?

245
00:20:53,765 --> 00:20:58,804
I've heard this strange story from
a younger colleague at Celeb Daily.

246
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:03,367
He says that Cha Soojeong
was hiding a son.

247
00:21:04,201 --> 00:21:05,941
A son?

248
00:21:08,673 --> 00:21:10,672
There is no way.

249
00:21:11,261 --> 00:21:14,108
If that was the
case, why would I not...

250
00:21:19,627 --> 00:21:21,597
What's even stranger...

251
00:21:21,798 --> 00:21:24,530
is that an assistant of
Jo Pilyeon named Go met him,

252
00:21:24,688 --> 00:21:27,665
and started asking all sorts
of questions about that kid.

253
00:21:28,671 --> 00:21:30,368
Jo Pilyeon?

254
00:21:31,346 --> 00:21:36,411
I thought something might
be up, so I came to tell you.

255
00:21:42,972 --> 00:21:47,685
Just because Wooju keeps
bringing home all those toys...

256
00:21:47,886 --> 00:21:49,108
That?

257
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:51,608
You know that our playground is
undergoing a renovation, right?

258
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:55,110
Employees of that company took
a liking to Wooju, and bought them.

259
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,943
Employees?

260
00:21:59,223 --> 00:22:01,921
What is the name of that company?

261
00:22:02,076 --> 00:22:04,603
Ahh... How are you?

262
00:22:04,717 --> 00:22:06,803
It's you.

263
00:22:06,912 --> 00:22:09,423
I don't see the kids today,

264
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:10,720
did they go somewhere?

265
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:12,735
They're out on an excursion.

266
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,810
But, you like the facilities?

267
00:22:14,953 --> 00:22:16,535
Yes, I do.

268
00:22:16,698 --> 00:22:20,216
Where did the kids go, again?

269
00:22:20,392 --> 00:22:23,263
To a nearby park.

270
00:22:25,805 --> 00:22:28,004
I'm really enjoying
your songs, they're so nice.

271
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:29,859
Thank you.

272
00:22:29,985 --> 00:22:31,768
- Thank you.
- Yes.

273
00:22:31,843 --> 00:22:33,473
Hi.

274
00:22:35,255 --> 00:22:36,479
Yes?

275
00:22:36,693 --> 00:22:38,393
Just a moment.

276
00:22:38,562 --> 00:22:41,074
Soojeong.
Get the phone.

277
00:22:41,477 --> 00:22:43,950
Excuse me just a moment.

278
00:22:46,078 --> 00:22:47,222
Yes?

279
00:22:47,321 --> 00:22:49,472
Miju, you're in trouble!

280
00:22:49,582 --> 00:22:51,384
What's the matter?

281
00:22:55,036 --> 00:22:57,187
Where is Wooju now?

282
00:23:03,586 --> 00:23:05,398
How did it go?

283
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:08,029
Hangang Construction won.

284
00:23:09,625 --> 00:23:11,731
Gangmo finally did it.

285
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:13,821
He beat Jo Minwoo.

286
00:23:14,134 --> 00:23:17,441
Anyhow, your brother is really something.

287
00:23:18,142 --> 00:23:21,606
But... What about this toy?

288
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,367
Ohh... I was going to
meet Wooju later today.

289
00:23:24,461 --> 00:23:27,798
I miss that little rascal
so much, it's driving me crazy.

290
00:23:27,956 --> 00:23:30,775
Go now, or else Ji Yeonsoo
will stick to you all day long.

291
00:23:30,846 --> 00:23:33,708
- I'll be right back.
- Yes.

292
00:23:34,527 --> 00:23:36,785
Yes, I understand.

293
00:23:40,797 --> 00:23:42,829
Go to the park near Jamshil.

294
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:45,058
What are you going to do?

295
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:51,126
If it's really Jo Minwoo's son...

296
00:23:51,981 --> 00:23:56,029
Are you confident you can accept him?

297
00:23:58,062 --> 00:23:59,399
Chick.

298
00:24:00,104 --> 00:24:01,439
Sparrow.

299
00:24:01,973 --> 00:24:03,612
Duck.

300
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:05,510
Sparrow.

301
00:24:05,755 --> 00:24:07,408
Puppy.

302
00:24:07,581 --> 00:24:10,901
- What is this?
- The bridge.

303
00:24:27,087 --> 00:24:28,971
Wooju.

304
00:24:30,682 --> 00:24:32,522
How have you been?

305
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,535
Come here.

306
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,906
Wooju?

307
00:24:43,019 --> 00:24:45,281
Come here, Wooju.

308
00:24:47,121 --> 00:24:48,997
I'm your uncle.

309
00:24:49,264 --> 00:24:50,730
Uncle?!

310
00:24:50,857 --> 00:24:52,338
Uncle?

311
00:24:52,461 --> 00:24:55,231
What the hell are you talking about?

312
00:24:56,338 --> 00:25:01,141
Lee Miju is my sister.

313
00:25:02,472 --> 00:25:04,597
W.... What?!

314
00:25:04,708 --> 00:25:10,179
The sister I lost because of you!

315
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:14,723
Fascinating.

316
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:17,437
Things are getting
tangled beyond belief,

317
00:25:17,592 --> 00:25:19,997
but all this is quite fascinating.

318
00:25:21,463 --> 00:25:23,347
Wooju...

319
00:25:24,569 --> 00:25:26,352
Come to me.

320
00:25:26,645 --> 00:25:28,495
Come to Uncle, Wooju.

321
00:25:28,811 --> 00:25:30,594
Come on.

322
00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:41,316
Wooju!

323
00:25:41,709 --> 00:25:43,379
Wooju!

324
00:25:43,504 --> 00:25:45,345
Wooju!!

325
00:25:48,937 --> 00:25:50,368
Kang Wooju!

326
00:25:50,478 --> 00:25:52,116
Wooju!

327
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:54,416
Wooju!

328
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,003
Oppa...

329
00:26:11,988 --> 00:26:16,016
You two knew about Wooju?

330
00:26:16,126 --> 00:26:19,034
I never imagined that Gangmo knew.

331
00:26:25,456 --> 00:26:27,943
I said come here!

332
00:26:28,993 --> 00:26:31,049
Here... Come.

333
00:27:08,172 --> 00:27:10,132
That is my grandson.

334
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:12,024
Give him to me.

335
00:27:12,568 --> 00:27:16,194
You just try to lay a finger on him.

336
00:27:16,913 --> 00:27:19,860
Wooju, come on.

337
00:27:20,047 --> 00:27:22,607
Come to Grandpa.

338
00:27:28,289 --> 00:27:29,944
I see...

339
00:27:30,201 --> 00:27:32,645
Your blood doesn't lie.

340
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:37,438
Lowly blood flows in your veins,
so you can't even recognize your grandfather.

341
00:27:37,607 --> 00:27:42,873
If Jo Minwoo knew of this, he
wouldn't just sit back and watch?!

342
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:46,626
My guess was right.

343
00:27:46,963 --> 00:27:56,001
You were planning to hide Wooju
so that Minwoo wouldn't find out.

344
00:27:57,309 --> 00:28:02,848
I suggest you give up while I
still give you the option, Congressman Jo.

345
00:28:23,655 --> 00:28:25,783
Uncle...

346
00:28:26,182 --> 00:28:28,412
Uncle.

347
00:28:28,845 --> 00:28:30,900
That's right, Wooju.

348
00:28:31,478 --> 00:28:33,129
I'm your uncle.

349
00:28:33,258 --> 00:28:37,039
I want to go to Mommy.

350
00:28:37,284 --> 00:28:38,340
All right.

351
00:28:38,578 --> 00:28:40,692
Let's go meet Mommy.

352
00:28:46,944 --> 00:28:49,115
I'm scared.

353
00:28:50,999 --> 00:28:52,840
Scared?

354
00:28:53,501 --> 00:28:55,183
Ahh! It tingles!

355
00:28:55,658 --> 00:28:57,446
It tingles?

356
00:28:57,714 --> 00:28:59,943
Ahh... The beard?

357
00:29:07,571 --> 00:29:09,944
Mommy!

358
00:29:12,259 --> 00:29:14,574
Gangmo Oppa.

359
00:29:31,076 --> 00:29:36,747
Back then, after I ran away,

360
00:29:38,013 --> 00:29:41,794
I tried to get an
abortion more than once.

361
00:29:42,671 --> 00:29:47,517
But every time I convinced myself to do it,

362
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:51,513
the baby would start
kicking inside my womb.

363
00:29:58,041 --> 00:29:59,953
I'm sorry.

364
00:30:00,758 --> 00:30:03,577
I'm sorry, Seongmo Oppa.

365
00:30:06,452 --> 00:30:08,899
Sorry, Gangmo Oppa.

366
00:30:09,531 --> 00:30:11,487
Don't cry, Miju.

367
00:30:13,457 --> 00:30:15,666
Wooju is your son.

368
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:19,597
He has nothing to do with Jo Pilyeon.

369
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:22,123
And...

370
00:30:23,776 --> 00:30:26,336
he's my one and only nephew.

371
00:30:27,616 --> 00:30:30,046
Oppa...

372
00:30:56,858 --> 00:31:03,084
Your uncles will come for you
soon, so listen to Grandma, uh?

373
00:31:03,717 --> 00:31:05,428
All right.

374
00:31:06,262 --> 00:31:08,290
Wooju.

375
00:31:09,929 --> 00:31:12,000
Don't worry, Miju.

376
00:31:12,105 --> 00:31:15,273
My sister loves Wooju, too.

377
00:31:15,368 --> 00:31:19,892
We'll write you news of him every day.

378
00:31:23,213 --> 00:31:25,194
Mom...

379
00:31:25,356 --> 00:31:29,865
Aigoo...
You poor little thing...

380
00:31:35,703 --> 00:31:36,897
Here... Here.

381
00:31:37,041 --> 00:31:39,438
It's time to board the flight.

382
00:31:39,549 --> 00:31:41,263
Sotae, is everything ready?

383
00:31:41,426 --> 00:31:42,856
Don't you worry.

384
00:31:42,947 --> 00:31:45,120
We'll take them to the UK and come back.

385
00:31:45,235 --> 00:31:47,430
Of all people, why did
you have to send me with him?

386
00:31:47,518 --> 00:31:49,620
You can't even speak English,
wanted to go all alone?

387
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:51,715
Why, you do?

388
00:31:51,907 --> 00:31:54,977
Try anything funny over
there, and you're both dead.

389
00:31:55,055 --> 00:31:56,823
Don't you worry, Brother-in-law.

390
00:31:56,912 --> 00:31:58,996
- You can trust me.
- Aigoo...

391
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:01,038
It's because it's you that I'm worried.

392
00:32:01,124 --> 00:32:04,690
Can't you even save a few nice
words for me when I leave?

393
00:32:18,091 --> 00:32:20,205
You two, watch it!

394
00:33:16,754 --> 00:33:20,307
It's a list of the companies
Noh Gapsoo invested in.

395
00:33:26,591 --> 00:33:28,221
He invested a huge sum of money.

396
00:33:28,331 --> 00:33:30,639
Seems like he put everything on the line.

397
00:33:30,763 --> 00:33:34,118
So it has something to do
with the list of ailing companies.

398
00:33:34,327 --> 00:33:35,741
That's right.

399
00:33:35,898 --> 00:33:40,835
They'll make huge profits out
of M&As with companies from that list.

400
00:33:41,007 --> 00:33:45,968
Looks like Manbo Construction
was eying a few major M&As as well...

401
00:33:46,275 --> 00:33:48,297
We could take this opportunity to inflict...

402
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:52,806
a major blow on Manbo
Construction and Noh Gapsoo.

403
00:33:53,395 --> 00:33:57,853
One good strike, and it
won't stop at a major blow.

404
00:33:58,227 --> 00:34:02,972
Particularly when it comes to
Noh Gapsoo, this could be fatal to him.

405
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:07,829
So all we need to do is saving the
ailing companies involved with them?

406
00:34:07,943 --> 00:34:11,278
It's like belling the cat.

407
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:14,510
You can give this data to Congressman Oh,

408
00:34:14,624 --> 00:34:17,691
but you must be careful not
to offend him or arouse suspicion.

409
00:34:17,907 --> 00:34:19,603
I'm sure.

410
00:34:19,905 --> 00:34:24,524
Because he'll certainly suspect
we'll have something to gain as well.

411
00:34:24,633 --> 00:34:28,647
Who could be fit for this job?

412
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:37,245
I do have someone in mind...

413
00:34:46,384 --> 00:34:49,835
Ohh! And what is all this?

414
00:34:50,008 --> 00:34:51,962
Just thought I'd bring you lunch.

415
00:34:52,061 --> 00:34:53,502
What?

416
00:34:54,279 --> 00:34:55,753
Wow... I'm really touched.

417
00:34:55,862 --> 00:34:59,512
So, what, you were thinking
of me while preparing this?

418
00:34:59,621 --> 00:35:01,930
Try it, I don't know if you'll like it.

419
00:35:02,024 --> 00:35:03,100
All right.

420
00:35:03,241 --> 00:35:08,079
I was really hungry,
so you'll have to excuse me.

421
00:35:11,055 --> 00:35:12,416
How is it?

422
00:35:12,594 --> 00:35:16,719
Ohh... Good enough that my eyes
are about to pop out from the shock.

423
00:35:16,828 --> 00:35:18,066
Here... Join me.

424
00:35:18,222 --> 00:35:20,868
Go ahead, I've already had lunch.

425
00:35:24,477 --> 00:35:28,721
I'm really thankful for
what you did last time, Deputy.

426
00:35:28,826 --> 00:35:30,994
If this is about that,
let's talk when I'm done eating.

427
00:35:31,093 --> 00:35:33,350
I think it might make
me get an indigestion.

428
00:35:36,352 --> 00:35:41,772
I detest Congressman Jo Pilyeon.

429
00:35:43,886 --> 00:35:48,858
The fact I could hate
someone with so much passion...

430
00:35:49,491 --> 00:35:52,448
surprises me more than I could ever imagine.

431
00:35:52,539 --> 00:35:55,238
Did anything else happen?

432
00:35:55,347 --> 00:36:00,406
That man tried to
take my son away from me.

433
00:36:00,515 --> 00:36:06,109
And because of that, I had
to separate from my beloved child.

434
00:36:10,682 --> 00:36:12,537
Let me hear the details.

435
00:36:17,794 --> 00:36:20,927
Once the list of ailing
companies is announced,

436
00:36:21,286 --> 00:36:26,003
Jo Pilyeon will gain
immense profits in the process.

437
00:36:33,478 --> 00:36:35,490
I'm not going to ask you for help.

438
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:38,687
Just keep that data.

439
00:36:38,845 --> 00:36:42,699
If you don't need it,
you can just throw it away.

440
00:36:44,553 --> 00:36:46,336
Soojeong,

441
00:36:47,674 --> 00:36:49,264
you've really changed.

442
00:36:49,461 --> 00:36:55,256
If I only could, I'd
like to change even more.

443
00:36:56,248 --> 00:36:59,569
Here... For starters,
let's finish my lunch.

444
00:37:04,458 --> 00:37:08,747
So what you're saying is
that Jo Pilyeon showed this list...

445
00:37:08,934 --> 00:37:12,527
to a private lender going
by the name Noh Gapsoo?

446
00:37:12,635 --> 00:37:13,967
Yes.

447
00:37:14,513 --> 00:37:18,486
And he's going to
gain great benefits from it.

448
00:37:18,755 --> 00:37:25,636
So Manbo Construction is putting
that list to use and planning acquisitions.

449
00:37:25,881 --> 00:37:28,081
Your guess was right.

450
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:31,279
Weren't you suspecting both Manbo
Construction and the private lending cartel?

451
00:37:31,489 --> 00:37:35,534
But how come you have this data?

452
00:37:37,096 --> 00:37:37,938
Ahh... Yes.

453
00:37:38,045 --> 00:37:42,274
- That...
- To get revenge against Jo Pilyeon,

454
00:37:42,777 --> 00:37:45,050
I could get my hands
on even more than that.

455
00:37:45,193 --> 00:37:46,361
Revenge?!

456
00:37:46,617 --> 00:37:48,498
Did you just say revenge?

457
00:37:48,716 --> 00:37:50,197
Yes.

458
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:55,680
Because that man...

459
00:37:58,326 --> 00:38:00,790
killed our father.

460
00:38:02,625 --> 00:38:04,308
Soojeong...

461
00:38:04,553 --> 00:38:06,968
You never told me that?!

462
00:38:07,255 --> 00:38:10,010
Jo Pilyeon is a murderer.

463
00:38:10,202 --> 00:38:14,775
And he used that money
to get where he is today.

464
00:38:17,564 --> 00:38:19,534
Go ahead and open it.

465
00:38:22,913 --> 00:38:27,329
So you want me to take this money,
and engage in trafficking of official posts?

466
00:38:27,774 --> 00:38:29,231
Is that not enough?

467
00:38:29,356 --> 00:38:31,433
What do you take me for...

468
00:38:31,538 --> 00:38:32,649
Take it and leave!

469
00:38:32,739 --> 00:38:35,392
I'm not here just for the money!

470
00:38:35,488 --> 00:38:37,221
That money is not for you.

471
00:38:37,322 --> 00:38:39,508
Just funds I'm devoting to our country.

472
00:38:39,823 --> 00:38:43,434
If you wish to maintain power,
you need immense funds.

473
00:38:44,518 --> 00:38:47,689
That's right... I remember.

474
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,320
Back then,

475
00:38:50,499 --> 00:38:57,272
he brought the kind of money that a
mere army lieutenant couldn't even dream of.

476
00:38:58,164 --> 00:39:00,306
So that's what happened.

477
00:39:00,579 --> 00:39:03,895
Is it from back in your childhood?

478
00:39:04,433 --> 00:39:05,353
Yes.

479
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:08,684
And I've heard that the statute
of limitations has already expired.

480
00:39:08,792 --> 00:39:11,867
I surely can't say my hands are clean.

481
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:16,187
But letting a murderer enter congress...

482
00:39:16,296 --> 00:39:20,550
is something my conscience would never allow!

483
00:39:34,375 --> 00:39:36,876
I'm sure you're not here to meet me.

484
00:39:36,982 --> 00:39:39,206
Is there anyone else
you came here to meet?

485
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:44,483
Just came to have a look at that
power you always love to talk about.

486
00:39:45,188 --> 00:39:46,449
And?

487
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:49,613
Did you meet the savior that can help you?

488
00:39:49,742 --> 00:39:54,703
Coming here seems to have taught
me how to fight with you, at least.

489
00:39:54,861 --> 00:39:56,543
Fight with me?!

490
00:39:59,017 --> 00:40:03,214
So an ignorant, lowly
little tramp like you would fight me?!

491
00:40:04,948 --> 00:40:07,142
Laugh all you want,

492
00:40:07,501 --> 00:40:10,075
and just remember my words.

493
00:40:11,268 --> 00:40:16,689
If you commit a sin,
you'll be punished for it.

494
00:40:17,279 --> 00:40:24,344
That's the truth of life an ignorant,
lowly tramp like me has learned.

495
00:40:25,624 --> 00:40:30,599
Turns out you sent Wooju
somewhere out of the country.

496
00:40:31,778 --> 00:40:35,814
There are no two ways
about it, I'll have to raise Wooju.

497
00:40:35,937 --> 00:40:40,102
I can't let you corrupt that child's
mind with foolish intents of revenge.

498
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:42,244
Then, give it a try.

499
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:47,191
Because we will no longer
just sit back and watch.

500
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,155
That tramp...

501
00:40:55,309 --> 00:40:58,328
Who the hell did she just meet?

502
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:15,622
- Ailing Company - Viable Company -

503
00:41:18,972 --> 00:41:20,656
- Hangang Construction -

504
00:41:27,316 --> 00:41:28,423
- Viable Company -

505
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:41,705
Seems like plenty of heads
will roll, after that list is announced.

506
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:43,964
We did our best.

507
00:41:44,211 --> 00:41:47,532
Whatever the result might end
up being, we'll have no regrets.

508
00:41:47,825 --> 00:41:48,854
Right, Director?

509
00:41:48,999 --> 00:41:53,736
If that's what you believe,
I'll just lower my expectations.

510
00:41:53,859 --> 00:41:56,706
By the way, Director Yoo.

511
00:41:57,030 --> 00:42:00,833
Isn't it time we get Jeongyeon married?

512
00:42:00,991 --> 00:42:02,342
Stop right there.

513
00:42:02,486 --> 00:42:04,434
Let me eat in peace, Dad.

514
00:42:04,531 --> 00:42:05,890
Ohh Ohh... You little...

515
00:42:06,052 --> 00:42:10,022
Every time I mention
marriage, look at how she reacts.

516
00:42:13,873 --> 00:42:15,689
Aigoo!

517
00:42:15,948 --> 00:42:18,634
Isn't this Chairman Hwang?

518
00:42:18,863 --> 00:42:22,017
Chairman Cheon, what brings you here?

519
00:42:22,114 --> 00:42:25,333
I had to discuss business with President Lee.

520
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:31,931
How are you, Jeongyeon?

521
00:42:33,081 --> 00:42:34,548
Fine.

522
00:42:34,807 --> 00:42:37,465
I'll see you again, then.

523
00:42:37,602 --> 00:42:38,488
Yes.

524
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:40,566
Enjoy the evening.

525
00:42:52,733 --> 00:42:58,618
I'd like to use your new
boilers in our apartments.

526
00:42:58,723 --> 00:42:59,770
Thank you.

527
00:42:59,879 --> 00:43:04,072
We'll be sure to give you a discount.

528
00:43:04,734 --> 00:43:07,811
So let's leave business at that.

529
00:43:08,098 --> 00:43:12,887
Actually, I wanted to
have a word with you.

530
00:43:14,109 --> 00:43:17,068
As you well know,
I have two daughters.

531
00:43:17,194 --> 00:43:19,190
The older one married a doctor,

532
00:43:19,284 --> 00:43:21,644
and I'm left with her.

533
00:43:21,769 --> 00:43:24,052
Let me tell him.

534
00:43:25,231 --> 00:43:30,738
I kept pestering my father
that I wanted to marry you.

535
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:40,271
He wants a son-in-law who
can later take over the company.

536
00:43:40,558 --> 00:43:43,154
I told him I liked you,

537
00:43:43,278 --> 00:43:45,555
and he gave me his consent
without a single hesitation.

538
00:43:45,668 --> 00:43:52,981
Can you take care of my
daughter and the company for me?

539
00:43:57,194 --> 00:44:00,128
I'll be right back.

540
00:44:00,832 --> 00:44:03,003
Jeongyeon...

541
00:44:06,677 --> 00:44:08,144
Gangmo.

542
00:44:08,273 --> 00:44:11,940
Can you give us an answer here?

543
00:44:12,208 --> 00:44:16,901
Both as an entrepreneur and a man,

544
00:44:17,193 --> 00:44:20,532
I believe you won't refuse our offer.

545
00:44:25,999 --> 00:44:28,185
I'll be honest, then.

546
00:44:28,702 --> 00:44:33,908
As a businessman, getting the chance
to take over Gwangmyeong Construction...

547
00:44:34,483 --> 00:44:36,647
is a very alluring offer.

548
00:44:37,398 --> 00:44:43,243
And as a man, marrying with
a woman as beautiful as Suyeon...

549
00:44:43,368 --> 00:44:45,878
would be a true blessing.

550
00:44:47,475 --> 00:44:50,278
Then, are you giving us your consent?

551
00:44:51,199 --> 00:44:53,358
But, you'll have to forgive me.

552
00:44:55,486 --> 00:44:58,218
Because, for a very long time,

553
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,674
I've been in love with someone.

554
00:45:12,590 --> 00:45:16,056
Excuse me just a moment.

555
00:45:30,284 --> 00:45:32,397
You idiot.

556
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:39,731
It would be so great for Gangmo...

557
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:54,642
Guess I had one drink too many.

558
00:45:58,134 --> 00:46:03,818
The more I see her,
the more Suyeon grows on me.

559
00:46:04,044 --> 00:46:05,631
She's so affable,

560
00:46:05,798 --> 00:46:07,783
pretty...

561
00:46:09,638 --> 00:46:13,526
Tonight my father kept pestering
me about getting married.

562
00:46:13,747 --> 00:46:16,378
I guess he was setting up
some meetings with matchmakers.

563
00:46:17,155 --> 00:46:19,139
Good for you.

564
00:46:22,389 --> 00:46:25,034
I'll spend the rest of my life alone instead.

565
00:46:27,623 --> 00:46:28,359
Uh?

566
00:46:28,572 --> 00:46:30,461
I won't get married.

567
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:34,185
I'll live alone for the rest of my life.

568
00:46:35,336 --> 00:46:37,881
Until I'm old enough to die.

569
00:46:38,951 --> 00:46:40,346
That's nasty.

570
00:46:40,448 --> 00:46:43,215
Getting married by yourself, and all.

571
00:46:59,943 --> 00:47:01,510
Jeongyeon.

572
00:47:02,991 --> 00:47:05,321
Will you do me just one favor?

573
00:47:06,687 --> 00:47:08,757
Just like me,

574
00:47:10,727 --> 00:47:16,335
can't you just live alone
and not get married?

575
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:21,262
You know...

576
00:47:23,361 --> 00:47:25,187
Then,

577
00:47:25,486 --> 00:47:28,350
I think I'd feel a little less bored.

578
00:47:33,663 --> 00:47:36,209
Can you do that for me?

579
00:47:59,222 --> 00:48:01,807
Ohh.... Give me the paper.

580
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:08,955
- Ministry of Finance
Announces 21 Ailing Companies -
[Stock Exchange in Turmoil]

581
00:48:09,056 --> 00:48:12,478
Wh... What is this?

582
00:48:19,668 --> 00:48:21,209
Come on in, Congressman Jo.

583
00:48:21,321 --> 00:48:25,379
Why is it just 21 companies?

584
00:48:25,566 --> 00:48:29,117
Where did Hangang Construction
and the remaining ten companies go?

585
00:48:29,275 --> 00:48:32,770
I consulted with specialists,
and we compiled a new list.

586
00:48:32,942 --> 00:48:36,292
What's wrong with giving a few
promising companies another chance?

587
00:48:36,451 --> 00:48:38,354
We worked on this together from the start!

588
00:48:38,448 --> 00:48:41,576
You weren't supposed to
decide this all on your own!

589
00:48:41,683 --> 00:48:44,739
I received the president's
consent before we announced the list.

590
00:48:44,898 --> 00:48:48,003
If you want to bring that up,
head to the Blue House and ask him.

591
00:48:48,579 --> 00:48:51,008
Congressman Oh, you...

592
00:48:51,210 --> 00:48:55,224
See how long you last here
after showing me such contempt.

593
00:48:55,584 --> 00:48:57,623
Watch what you say, Jo Pilyeon.

594
00:48:57,841 --> 00:49:01,039
Already forgot when you walked
into my office with those shabby military boots,

595
00:49:01,235 --> 00:49:06,152
groveling at my feet and
begging me to make you a big shot?

596
00:49:06,497 --> 00:49:07,358
Say what?

597
00:49:07,454 --> 00:49:09,823
Let this be a warning.

598
00:49:09,929 --> 00:49:11,261
Watch it.

599
00:49:11,507 --> 00:49:15,907
I still haven't mentioned all the
skeletons in your closet to the top brass.

600
00:49:16,339 --> 00:49:17,748
Skeletons?!

601
00:49:17,854 --> 00:49:20,246
Out of the thirty-one companies on that list,

602
00:49:20,350 --> 00:49:26,068
I omitted exactly the ten you and
those loan sharks made a move on.

603
00:49:26,168 --> 00:49:30,324
I'm sure you understand what that means?!

604
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:41,624
Insolent prick...

605
00:49:54,925 --> 00:49:56,981
It's Noh Gapsoo's list of assets,

606
00:49:57,197 --> 00:50:00,372
along with his management
plans for the organization.

607
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:05,879
Send these via fax to each member.

608
00:50:06,037 --> 00:50:07,921
All right.

609
00:50:10,531 --> 00:50:12,766
Are you ready, Jeongyeon?

610
00:50:12,881 --> 00:50:14,477
Yes, Director.

611
00:50:15,376 --> 00:50:16,843
Look, President Noh.

612
00:50:16,973 --> 00:50:19,158
Why should I be
held responsible for that?

613
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:22,714
If you really want to bring
that up, go talk with my father!

614
00:50:25,028 --> 00:50:27,527
You son of a bitch...

615
00:50:36,765 --> 00:50:40,360
I'd like to speak with Congressman Jo Pilyeon.

616
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:44,272
When does that
goddamned meeting end?

617
00:50:44,443 --> 00:50:46,254
I'm Noh Gapsoo!

618
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:48,052
President.

619
00:50:48,167 --> 00:50:49,639
A meeting was gathered.

620
00:50:49,748 --> 00:50:51,186
A what?

621
00:50:51,312 --> 00:50:54,306
- The cartel...
- I am the cartel, you idiot!

622
00:50:54,396 --> 00:50:56,622
Who gave the order?

623
00:51:01,496 --> 00:51:06,438
So... Who organized this meeting?

624
00:51:08,249 --> 00:51:10,230
Why aren't you answering me?

625
00:51:10,579 --> 00:51:13,268
I asked who called for this meeting!

626
00:51:14,145 --> 00:51:16,144
I did.

627
00:51:25,266 --> 00:51:30,859
And how can someone who's been
expelled from this organization sit there?

628
00:51:33,030 --> 00:51:40,560
The report you've been given
lists Noh Gapsoo's remaining assets.

629
00:51:47,850 --> 00:51:50,479
I'll let President Noh answer firsthand.

630
00:51:50,592 --> 00:51:54,152
How much capital do you have left?

631
00:51:56,218 --> 00:51:59,059
I never imagined your cash flow
situation was in this state.

632
00:51:59,198 --> 00:52:01,193
You disappoint me, President Noh.

633
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:06,703
The logic behind our organization is power.

634
00:52:06,966 --> 00:52:10,201
And power means money to us.

635
00:52:12,128 --> 00:52:17,951
President Noh was foolish enough to
squander all that money on the stock exchange.

636
00:52:19,015 --> 00:52:20,991
For incompetence,

637
00:52:21,118 --> 00:52:25,912
for allowing politicians to deceive
him and threaten our organization's foundations,

638
00:52:26,070 --> 00:52:32,843
and for running this organization
with only personal gains in mind,

639
00:52:33,224 --> 00:52:38,436
I present a motion to expel
President Noh from this organization.

640
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:40,535
Expel?!

641
00:52:41,167 --> 00:52:42,550
And with what authority would you do that?

642
00:52:42,634 --> 00:52:47,178
Anyone opposing this motion,
please raise your hand.

643
00:52:51,492 --> 00:52:54,325
- Yoo Gyeongok, you...
- Watch what you say.

644
00:52:54,641 --> 00:52:58,398
Because starting today, I inherit
leadership from you.

645
00:53:07,126 --> 00:53:14,347
Starting now, I will be in
charge of this organization.

646
00:53:15,785 --> 00:53:19,523
Should anyone oppose it, you
may follow President Noh out of here.

647
00:53:32,731 --> 00:53:34,773
Right as the report suggested,

648
00:53:34,983 --> 00:53:41,632
our organization is going to fund
the opening of a credit institution.

649
00:53:42,216 --> 00:53:47,769
And Director Hwang is
going to be in charge of it.

650
00:53:55,533 --> 00:53:57,541
I'm Hwang Jeongyeon.

651
00:53:58,064 --> 00:54:02,862
Opening a credit institution has
been a long-cherished dream of ours.

652
00:54:03,265 --> 00:54:09,131
And it is time you and I open
a new future for this organization.

653
00:54:25,242 --> 00:54:30,346
So in the end, Noh Gapsoo let Yoo
Gyeongok gain control of the cartel.

654
00:54:32,684 --> 00:54:35,193
This is all because of Oh Byeongtak.

655
00:54:35,445 --> 00:54:37,611
Not content with damaging me,

656
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:39,471
now he even blackmails people.

657
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:41,642
How do you plan to deal with him?

658
00:54:42,893 --> 00:54:45,338
We need to get rid of him.

659
00:54:45,444 --> 00:54:49,034
But what you're dealing
with is a huge political player.

660
00:54:49,236 --> 00:54:52,342
Or else, I'll be the one to be ruined.

661
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:58,783
This fight depends on
who wields his sword first.

662
00:55:07,331 --> 00:55:13,582
- Demonstrations Spread Across the Nation -

663
00:55:40,464 --> 00:55:46,187
- Jo Pilyeon -
Jo Minwoo --- Noh Gapsoo

664
00:55:50,127 --> 00:55:56,457
What do I owe all this to, Congressman?

665
00:55:56,715 --> 00:55:58,550
Chairman Hwang.

666
00:55:58,671 --> 00:56:03,574
I hear rumors that you're in close
contact with opposition party members?

667
00:56:03,718 --> 00:56:06,530
Well... There is no ulterior motive.

668
00:56:06,643 --> 00:56:08,589
It's just a personal friendship, that is all.

669
00:56:08,684 --> 00:56:15,592
Did you by any chance
give that account to them?

670
00:56:18,036 --> 00:56:20,865
What are you implying
with that question?

671
00:56:20,990 --> 00:56:22,460
I won't beat around the bush.

672
00:56:22,581 --> 00:56:25,003
Give me that account.

673
00:56:25,111 --> 00:56:31,402
Last time I tried to give you something,
you didn't even take a look at it.

674
00:56:31,733 --> 00:56:36,090
Why would you suddenly
ask for the secret fund account?

675
00:56:36,262 --> 00:56:40,292
It's only a matter of time before
the world is turned upside down.

676
00:56:40,428 --> 00:56:44,280
People like me can
sense that instinctively.

677
00:56:45,344 --> 00:56:49,960
People are shedding blood on the street,
claiming they'll open a new world.

678
00:56:50,075 --> 00:56:54,173
But with politicians like Jo Pilyeon still on top,

679
00:56:54,518 --> 00:57:01,105
how are we ever going to
repay those precious sacrifices?

680
00:57:03,492 --> 00:57:05,332
Congressman.

681
00:57:05,813 --> 00:57:11,383
I've been waiting
a moment like this for years.

682
00:57:11,492 --> 00:57:16,661
When can I give you that account?

683
00:57:21,651 --> 00:57:25,921
The opposition and demonstrators
are soon going to ask for direct elections,

684
00:57:26,094 --> 00:57:28,848
and organize massive rallies.

685
00:57:29,412 --> 00:57:31,378
That's our chance.

686
00:57:31,609 --> 00:57:35,750
So that's when you plan to
reveal the secret fund account.

687
00:57:36,684 --> 00:57:38,901
Then, will you resign?

688
00:57:39,011 --> 00:57:41,199
Once Jo Pilyeon is out of the picture,

689
00:57:41,861 --> 00:57:44,530
I have no more reason to work there.

690
00:57:44,775 --> 00:57:47,651
You really want to run an orchard?

691
00:57:50,742 --> 00:57:53,100
That would be the plan, I guess.

692
00:57:53,608 --> 00:57:56,436
But I don't really know
how much that would cost me.

693
00:57:56,873 --> 00:57:59,988
And would you happen to have
a job for me, if I came there?

694
00:58:00,664 --> 00:58:02,158
Why, want to quit as well?

695
00:58:02,272 --> 00:58:05,121
Honestly, I've had
it with all this myself.

696
00:58:05,230 --> 00:58:07,340
So hand your resignation
and come right away.

697
00:58:07,461 --> 00:58:10,255
You can always raise pigs next to me.

698
00:58:11,598 --> 00:58:15,190
- I really will!
- Have a drink.

699
00:58:15,797 --> 00:58:17,753
You two are really something!

700
00:58:18,012 --> 00:58:22,427
So what, are you going to
quit and leave me there alone?

701
00:58:25,993 --> 00:58:27,704
It's Chairman Hwang?!

702
00:58:28,198 --> 00:58:29,976
You don't have your beeper on you?

703
00:58:30,269 --> 00:58:32,219
Call him.

704
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:35,900
Where are you going?

705
00:58:36,118 --> 00:58:37,558
Why?

706
00:58:37,901 --> 00:58:40,288
Are you going to follow
me to the man's room?

707
00:58:42,492 --> 00:58:44,774
The man's room...

708
00:58:47,118 --> 00:58:49,291
Ahh... He's not here at the moment.

709
00:58:49,593 --> 00:58:54,568
Tell me a time and place
where we can meet with Oh Byeongtak.

710
00:58:55,891 --> 00:58:57,074
All right.

711
00:58:57,165 --> 00:58:58,691
I'll tell him.

712
00:58:58,807 --> 00:59:00,033
Ahh... Right.

713
00:59:00,151 --> 00:59:03,684
Congressman Oh said
he had something for us.

714
00:59:04,174 --> 00:59:08,493
I think it's some kind of
secret report on Jo Pilyeon.

715
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:09,632
All right.

716
00:59:09,741 --> 00:59:14,125
I'll go to Congressman
Oh's office at that time.

717
00:59:14,231 --> 00:59:17,110
Don't forget the account.

718
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:27,583
So are you finally going to use that account?

719
00:59:29,251 --> 00:59:34,557
Jo Pilyeon better be counting his days.

720
00:59:42,674 --> 00:59:44,193
Aren't you leaving?

721
00:59:44,466 --> 00:59:47,161
I'm so behind on reports...

722
00:59:47,335 --> 00:59:49,660
So wrap them up first.

723
00:59:49,784 --> 00:59:51,286
Let's go.

724
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:57,131
How nasty... You're
leaving all by yourselves?

725
00:59:57,300 --> 00:59:59,917
You really...

726
01:00:41,308 --> 01:00:46,380
Of all people who could escort
Oh Byeongtak, Yoo Chanseong?!

727
01:00:47,361 --> 01:00:48,612
We'll kill two birds with a stone.

728
01:00:48,708 --> 01:00:51,939
That's right... No need to
get our hands dirty twice.

729
01:00:52,042 --> 01:00:53,759
Anyhow, you're really brilliant.

730
01:00:53,903 --> 01:00:56,896
You used a newcomer to spy on them?

731
01:00:57,341 --> 01:01:00,692
That's what experience is all about.

732
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:14,801
Yes?

733
01:01:14,910 --> 01:01:16,961
You're still at work.

734
01:01:17,924 --> 01:01:21,044
You'll have to bring
me the account tomorrow.

735
01:01:21,576 --> 01:01:22,870
All of a sudden, why...

736
01:01:22,957 --> 01:01:26,767
Congressman Oh finally
decided to make a move.

737
01:01:33,619 --> 01:01:35,598
Seonbaenim!

738
01:01:37,064 --> 01:01:39,574
You just got here...
Where are you going now?

739
01:01:39,713 --> 01:01:42,255
No need to know.

740
01:01:43,592 --> 01:01:45,378
Take this.

741
01:01:45,587 --> 01:01:46,838
What is it?

742
01:01:47,094 --> 01:01:48,561
Beats me.

743
01:01:48,707 --> 01:01:50,231
Just eat it.

744
01:01:52,359 --> 01:01:54,343
I'm bored, so hurry back here.

745
01:01:54,430 --> 01:01:57,636
I'm busy today, so I can't follow you.

746
01:01:58,283 --> 01:01:59,999
I'll let you work.

747
01:02:00,197 --> 01:02:01,937
Not bad?!

748
01:02:07,775 --> 01:02:08,703
Saw that?

749
01:02:08,812 --> 01:02:12,405
I gave it to Chief Yoo as instructed.

750
01:02:12,937 --> 01:02:14,038
Well done.

751
01:02:14,275 --> 01:02:17,737
But what kind of test is this?

752
01:02:27,528 --> 01:02:29,156
I might forget it,

753
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:31,116
so you give this to them.

754
01:02:31,325 --> 01:02:33,022
All right, Sir.

761
01:04:13,572 --> 01:04:16,371
Yoo Chanseong was
bearing a grudge against me.

762
01:04:16,501 --> 01:04:19,458
So is that the reason why you killed him?

763
01:04:19,568 --> 01:04:22,672
Jo Pilyeon sent a spy to our office.

764
01:04:22,782 --> 01:04:27,820
He made sure he was
killed by a colleague of his!

765
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:33,046
If you're involved in his death,
the president won't forgive you.

766
01:04:33,172 --> 01:04:36,408
The congressman treated you like a son.

767
01:04:36,608 --> 01:04:38,058
Why...

768
01:04:38,178 --> 01:04:41,674
And I thought you were clever.
Guess I was wrong.

769
01:04:41,783 --> 01:04:46,731
Doing this to me was the
worst mistake you could make.
