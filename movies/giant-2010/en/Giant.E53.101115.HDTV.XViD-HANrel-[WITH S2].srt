Episode 53

4
00:01:00,969 --> 00:01:03,035
Eonni, have you heard the news?

5
00:01:03,121 --> 00:01:04,961
What news?

6
00:01:06,929 --> 00:01:07,807
<i>According to eye-witness reports,</i>

7
00:01:07,864 --> 00:01:10,054
<i>a blast was heard around 8 pm,</i>

8
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,833
<i>{\a6}- Huge Fire at Beaute Boilers Yongin Factory -</i>

9
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,833
<i>with fire spreading from
the gas tanks inside the factory.</i>

10
00:01:14,011 --> 00:01:17,841
<i>The Fire Department deployed thirty
fire trucks along with 200 firefighters...</i>

11
00:01:17,941 --> 00:01:22,936
<i>to tame the flames, but strong winds
are currently hampering their efforts.</i>

12
00:01:23,008 --> 00:01:25,323
<i>The police is confronting eye-witness
reports to find the possible causes,</i>

13
00:01:25,451 --> 00:01:29,831
<i>{\a6}with the possibility of an accidental
fire caused by negligence gaining ground.</i>

14
00:01:27,026 --> 00:01:30,107
What about President Lee...

15
00:01:49,052 --> 00:01:50,656
What's going on?

16
00:01:50,784 --> 00:01:52,144
Sotae!

17
00:01:52,187 --> 00:01:53,897
President...

18
00:01:55,754 --> 00:01:57,564
What happened?

19
00:01:57,674 --> 00:01:58,657
Any casualties?

20
00:01:58,772 --> 00:02:01,763
Thankfully, nobody died,

21
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:07,145
but employees on night duty
and a few guards were injured.

22
00:02:07,274 --> 00:02:08,433
How about the factory?

23
00:02:08,519 --> 00:02:11,582
Lot A was completely destroyed in the fire.

24
00:02:11,697 --> 00:02:13,927
And a significant part
of Lot B was heavily damaged.

25
00:02:14,056 --> 00:02:16,102
How about total damages incurred?

26
00:02:16,231 --> 00:02:20,940
I'd roughly estimate it at over five billion.

27
00:02:22,787 --> 00:02:25,936
What do we do now, President...

28
00:02:29,253 --> 00:02:31,243
Wait... Wait a moment!

29
00:02:31,329 --> 00:02:32,416
President Lee Gangmo, right?

30
00:02:32,488 --> 00:02:35,895
- What do you think caused this fire?
- Will you be able to release your new boilers now?

31
00:02:35,995 --> 00:02:38,800
This fire might severely impact
the sale of your Suseo apartments,

32
00:02:38,872 --> 00:02:41,105
please give us a comment.

33
00:02:41,906 --> 00:02:43,600
First...

34
00:02:44,945 --> 00:02:46,792
We'll have to take care of the injured.

35
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:50,828
Here... Now is not the
time, so let's talk later.

36
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,008
Yes.

37
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:20,697
It's me, Chairman.

38
00:03:20,911 --> 00:03:24,289
We just arrived at
Kimpo International Airport.

39
00:03:25,984 --> 00:03:28,469
The police is investigating
the causes of the fire.

40
00:03:28,698 --> 00:03:34,375
Stay with them until they
board that flight for the States.

41
00:03:34,604 --> 00:03:35,863
Yes, Chairman.

42
00:03:36,221 --> 00:03:37,481
Right...

43
00:03:37,982 --> 00:03:41,030
Gather reporters from all
major dailies by tomorrow morning.

44
00:03:41,274 --> 00:03:44,380
Are you going to have a press conference?

45
00:03:44,623 --> 00:03:47,535
We must end on the 9 o'clock news.

46
00:03:47,987 --> 00:03:54,571
Make sure my interview follows
right after reports of the accident.

47
00:03:54,757 --> 00:03:57,062
I understand, Chairman.

48
00:04:04,113 --> 00:04:07,288
Lee Miju, take a good look.

49
00:04:08,934 --> 00:04:13,457
How your brother, Lee Gangmo,

50
00:04:15,494 --> 00:04:18,882
will be mercilessly trampled on.

51
00:04:43,436 --> 00:04:44,954
Jeongyeo...

52
00:04:47,547 --> 00:04:49,319
Suyeon...

53
00:04:50,792 --> 00:04:52,943
What are you doing here?

54
00:04:53,186 --> 00:04:56,578
I saw you on TV and
got worried, so here I am.

55
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:17,986
Eonni... Who is that woman?

56
00:05:20,719 --> 00:05:26,687
I'll tell my father, and
find a way to help you.

57
00:05:26,873 --> 00:05:28,605
That won't be necessary.

58
00:05:28,748 --> 00:05:33,586
No, I really want to help you.

59
00:05:37,382 --> 00:05:42,054
Just the thought
gives me great strength.

60
00:05:49,789 --> 00:05:51,587
Are you just leaving?

61
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,963
I've seen Gangmo, so it's okay.

62
00:05:54,149 --> 00:05:56,675
Still, you came all the way here...

63
00:05:58,099 --> 00:05:59,438
Jina.

64
00:05:59,738 --> 00:06:04,061
Starting tomorrow, find
everything you can about this fire.

65
00:06:04,691 --> 00:06:08,415
Everything from total
damages to possible causes.

66
00:06:08,554 --> 00:06:10,559
All right, Eonni.

67
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,411
Once our factory in Osan is complete,

68
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:39,789
we will begin producing our ondol-based
Korean-style boiler in large quantities.

69
00:06:39,917 --> 00:06:42,322
And with our trend-setting heating system,

70
00:06:42,537 --> 00:06:46,312
our Suseo apartments will prove
once again their quality status.

71
00:06:46,498 --> 00:06:49,504
It looks like you're eying a fierce
competition with Hangang Construction...

72
00:06:49,604 --> 00:06:51,522
over these modern boiler systems,

73
00:06:51,637 --> 00:06:55,487
so how do you feel about
the recent fire at their factory?

74
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:59,294
A boiler is equipment dealing
with fire and heat on a daily basis.

75
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,623
If what we're dealing with is a fire accident,

76
00:07:01,766 --> 00:07:06,332
wouldn't that prove what kind of
quality you can expect from their products?

77
00:07:09,986 --> 00:07:11,757
How can a news program act like this?

78
00:07:11,843 --> 00:07:17,790
Putting that right after news of the fire...

79
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:22,342
Seems like the press is
pushing the negligence angle.

80
00:07:22,485 --> 00:07:26,584
It was no accidental fire, this is arson.

81
00:07:28,018 --> 00:07:31,259
So someone purposely
set the factory on fire?

82
00:07:31,373 --> 00:07:35,492
On the day of the accident,
two new guards joined the company.

83
00:07:35,649 --> 00:07:37,782
And now they have
vanished without a trace.

84
00:07:37,954 --> 00:07:41,904
Who could be capable
of something like this?

85
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:47,401
Whomever would most benefit from
our factory being destroyed in the fire.

86
00:07:47,544 --> 00:07:51,749
And... who is that?

87
00:07:53,167 --> 00:07:57,016
Miju. Have any more side dishes?

88
00:07:58,428 --> 00:08:00,308
All right.

89
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:16,552
There's a rumor the government
will clamp down on ailing companies.

90
00:08:16,781 --> 00:08:18,226
I know.

91
00:08:18,398 --> 00:08:20,373
So Congressman Oh
Byeongtak is in charge of it?

92
00:08:20,516 --> 00:08:22,594
And one more congressman.

93
00:08:23,367 --> 00:08:25,113
Jo Pilyeon.

94
00:08:30,812 --> 00:08:32,602
My guess was right.

95
00:08:33,329 --> 00:08:37,786
Jo Minwoo is behind this fire.

96
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:41,908
Even today's news was too deliberate.

97
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,642
As if someone had arranged it
that way to damage us.

98
00:08:44,742 --> 00:08:46,546
Gangmo.

99
00:08:47,462 --> 00:08:50,997
This is a conspiracy to bring you down.

100
00:08:51,827 --> 00:08:55,729
So give that account to me.

101
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:57,230
Don't start, Hyung.

102
00:08:57,373 --> 00:08:58,948
I'll handle this fight through business means.

103
00:08:59,019 --> 00:09:03,113
But Jo Minwoo is being backed
by his father's political influence.

104
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,018
Hangang Construction
will never endure their assault.

105
00:09:06,176 --> 00:09:07,664
I told you!

106
00:09:07,807 --> 00:09:09,935
That Jo Pilyeon is still suspicious of you.

107
00:09:10,035 --> 00:09:13,885
- This must be solved politically, Gangmo!
- Let me handle it, Hyung.

108
00:09:14,615 --> 00:09:16,633
I cannot tolerate...

109
00:09:18,115 --> 00:09:20,269
putting you in danger again.

110
00:09:37,924 --> 00:09:39,227
So what you're asking for...

111
00:09:39,427 --> 00:09:43,180
is a list of the ailing
companies we will force out?

112
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:48,159
To people like us, it would
be like finding a vein of gold.

113
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,893
If we move our pawns the right way,

114
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:53,729
it's only a matter of time before
we turn the stock market into a goldmine.

115
00:09:53,858 --> 00:09:55,447
I bet.

116
00:09:55,733 --> 00:09:58,623
Instead, if our profits go up,

117
00:09:58,737 --> 00:10:02,301
we will generously reward your patronage.

118
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,912
I'd like you to do
something for us, if possible.

119
00:10:08,069 --> 00:10:10,445
Yes, just say the word.

120
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,067
You know about the fire at Hangang
Construction's boiler factory, right?

121
00:10:15,926 --> 00:10:20,878
How long would it take to make toilet
paper out of Hangang Construction's shares?

122
00:10:21,623 --> 00:10:25,945
It's not a huge corporation,
but they've got solid foundations,

123
00:10:26,274 --> 00:10:28,379
so I'm afraid it'll take some effort?!

124
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:32,324
Then, spare no expense
and do whatever it takes.

125
00:10:32,696 --> 00:10:34,499
The sooner, the better.

126
00:10:34,671 --> 00:10:36,360
All right.

127
00:10:36,546 --> 00:10:38,364
We'll do that.

128
00:10:43,044 --> 00:10:46,661
That's their specialty, all right.

129
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:51,170
Hangang Construction will soon
be gasping for air at your feet.

130
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,977
If there is anything else you need, just tell me.

131
00:10:55,106 --> 00:10:58,212
I will do everything
in my power to help you.

132
00:10:58,643 --> 00:11:02,903
Once that list is complete,
I'd like to be the first to see it.

133
00:11:03,261 --> 00:11:05,866
We might use that
list to start a few M&As.

134
00:11:06,052 --> 00:11:09,845
So you plan to turn
the company into a group.

135
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:13,623
Because we can't keep going on
as just a construction company.

136
00:11:15,463 --> 00:11:18,918
It's during turbulent times that heroes emerge.

137
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:23,799
I'd like you to become the hero
who leads us out of these turbid days.

138
00:11:23,914 --> 00:11:26,075
None other than my son.

139
00:11:27,277 --> 00:11:30,312
Let's go have another
drink at home, for a change.

140
00:11:30,498 --> 00:11:32,215
I'm tired.

141
00:11:32,773 --> 00:11:34,591
I'll get going.

142
00:11:38,672 --> 00:11:43,494
Did you find a place in
the States for that Wooju?

143
00:11:43,608 --> 00:11:45,884
Yes, it will soon be ready.

144
00:11:45,999 --> 00:11:47,344
Rush.

145
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:51,867
To Minwoo, that's a time-bomb that
could explode any minute.

146
00:11:51,967 --> 00:11:54,114
All right, Congressman.

147
00:12:18,188 --> 00:12:21,066
Let's talk outside a minute.

148
00:12:22,569 --> 00:12:24,630
Come inside.

149
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,567
I remember hearing that
I'd never get to see you again...

150
00:12:41,667 --> 00:12:44,158
The fire at the boiler factory...

151
00:12:47,828 --> 00:12:50,083
Are you behind that?

152
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:53,500
Tell me!

153
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,146
Did you do that?

154
00:12:55,218 --> 00:12:57,307
Did you really...

155
00:13:00,795 --> 00:13:01,845
It wasn't you, right?

156
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:04,836
The Minwoo I knew would never do that.

157
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:06,697
You didn't do that, right?

158
00:13:06,797 --> 00:13:09,558
I guess the Minwoo you
knew would never do that.

159
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:13,451
But that Jo Minwoo...

160
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:17,659
was killed by none other than you.

161
00:13:19,075 --> 00:13:23,304
I'm no longer the man you knew.

162
00:13:23,401 --> 00:13:25,967
I know no such thing as a conscience.

163
00:13:26,454 --> 00:13:28,415
That's how I've lived so far,

164
00:13:29,317 --> 00:13:31,807
and how I'll continue to live.

165
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:36,087
If you try to bring harm to my brother,

166
00:13:36,874 --> 00:13:39,594
how do you think I will react?

167
00:13:40,238 --> 00:13:43,713
Think I'll just sit back
and watch like a retard?

168
00:13:44,171 --> 00:13:49,939
Must I really lose it and stake
my everything to get revenge?

169
00:13:51,485 --> 00:13:54,305
I beg you, Minwoo...

170
00:13:54,605 --> 00:13:59,556
Stop acting like your father,
enough with all those sins.

171
00:13:59,656 --> 00:14:01,188
Stop pretending you care about me.

172
00:14:01,317 --> 00:14:05,110
You know that
this will hurt everyone!

173
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:07,772
Nothing can hurt me anymore.

174
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:15,750
Since I've already lost everything.

175
00:14:24,423 --> 00:14:26,341
Minwoo!

176
00:14:54,816 --> 00:14:59,034
Aigoo... I've really had it with you...

177
00:14:59,292 --> 00:15:00,938
Let's start talking now, shall we?

178
00:15:01,052 --> 00:15:03,174
I don't know.

179
00:15:03,267 --> 00:15:04,431
You don't?

180
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,494
I mean it...
Please don't kill me.

181
00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:10,643
Please!
I don't know a thing.

182
00:15:11,024 --> 00:15:12,433
Boys.

183
00:15:13,349 --> 00:15:14,408
Don't do it...

184
00:15:14,465 --> 00:15:16,574
Spare me!
Don't...

185
00:15:28,978 --> 00:15:32,700
Where is your friend hiding?

186
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,406
I said speak, you piece of shit!

187
00:15:34,478 --> 00:15:36,353
I don't know!
Please...

188
00:15:36,481 --> 00:15:38,606
I really don't know!

189
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:56,001
He's not breathing!

190
00:16:00,781 --> 00:16:02,613
Hey... Wake up!

191
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:05,189
You fool!
Open those eyes!

192
00:16:21,487 --> 00:16:23,357
Ji Yeonsoo!

193
00:16:23,486 --> 00:16:26,434
Are you going to keep
following me around all day?

194
00:16:26,592 --> 00:16:29,855
That's the daily task I had
the privilege to be entrusted with.

195
00:16:30,087 --> 00:16:32,088
You know that
I've really had it with you?!

196
00:16:32,188 --> 00:16:35,366
So just... think of me as your shadow.

197
00:16:35,512 --> 00:16:37,034
What?!

198
00:16:40,677 --> 00:16:42,423
On your face.
Execute.

199
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:43,432
Uh?

200
00:16:43,533 --> 00:16:45,637
How dare you talk back?

201
00:16:45,766 --> 00:16:47,526
On your face!

202
00:16:57,095 --> 00:16:58,970
Seonbaenim!

203
00:17:02,019 --> 00:17:04,237
We need to talk.

204
00:17:22,752 --> 00:17:24,517
I'm sorry.

205
00:17:30,034 --> 00:17:32,187
You two are really something!

206
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:35,322
Are you just going to leave
me out in the cold like this?

207
00:17:36,338 --> 00:17:38,027
What's the matter?

208
00:17:38,381 --> 00:17:41,454
I've heard this from an acquaintance
of mine working for public security.

209
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,773
Turns out that at the
Namyoung-Dong Anti-Communist unit...

210
00:17:44,016 --> 00:17:46,757
a Korea University student died.

211
00:17:48,654 --> 00:17:50,042
Is it torture?

212
00:17:50,171 --> 00:17:51,616
Yes.

213
00:17:51,931 --> 00:17:55,395
All the police top brass
is on high alert as we speak.

214
00:17:55,524 --> 00:17:58,160
It finally happened...

215
00:18:00,548 --> 00:18:01,996
Dig a little deeper.

216
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:03,155
What do you plan to do?

217
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:08,981
The police will try to limit damages
and hide what really happened.

218
00:18:09,553 --> 00:18:11,256
We need to tell people the truth.

219
00:18:11,399 --> 00:18:12,859
Seonbaenim.

220
00:18:13,476 --> 00:18:16,252
This would mean betraying the force.

221
00:18:16,424 --> 00:18:19,645
It's our last chance
to get rid of Jo Pilyeon.

222
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:24,225
The political situation is like gunpowder.

223
00:18:24,382 --> 00:18:26,816
Set the fuse on fire,

224
00:18:27,445 --> 00:18:30,298
and the world as we
know it will forever change.

225
00:18:30,699 --> 00:18:35,164
And then we'll take this opportunity
to reveal the account as well.

226
00:18:35,293 --> 00:18:38,027
- But...
- I know what you fear.

227
00:18:38,814 --> 00:18:41,104
But trust me, Chanseong.

228
00:18:43,624 --> 00:18:45,041
Yes.

229
00:18:45,255 --> 00:18:47,814
Let's take this to the end.

230
00:19:03,692 --> 00:19:07,084
Where is Chief Yoo going?

231
00:19:08,563 --> 00:19:11,006
What have you been
doing in there all this time?

232
00:19:11,149 --> 00:19:13,153
What did you talk
about that I couldn't hear?

233
00:19:13,268 --> 00:19:15,754
Thirty squats. Execute.

234
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:16,459
Uh?

235
00:19:16,574 --> 00:19:18,945
I can't stand brats
who talk all the time.

236
00:19:19,246 --> 00:19:20,935
Are you going to disobey my orders?

237
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:23,855
- Still, Chief...
- Execute!

238
00:19:24,198 --> 00:19:25,987
Execute...

239
00:19:30,038 --> 00:19:31,655
One!

240
00:19:32,525 --> 00:19:34,211
Two!

241
00:19:35,032 --> 00:19:36,676
Three!

242
00:19:41,563 --> 00:19:43,220
Thank you for all your help.

243
00:19:43,377 --> 00:19:45,338
Don't mention it, we should
be the ones thanking you.

244
00:19:45,467 --> 00:19:48,286
So when the president comes back
from the US, you'll get us an appointment.

245
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:49,823
Certainly, Director Hwang.

246
00:19:49,923 --> 00:19:52,285
So you're going to sell 7,000
Hangang Construction shares?

247
00:19:52,385 --> 00:19:54,317
Yes... Yes.

248
00:19:54,432 --> 00:19:56,779
15,000 shares of Hangang Construction?

249
00:19:56,951 --> 00:19:58,468
All right.

250
00:19:58,611 --> 00:20:02,400
I told you already that it's a mess
today because of Hangang Construction.

251
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:05,181
Is there a problem with
Hangang Construction's shares?

252
00:20:05,324 --> 00:20:06,864
Ahh... That?

253
00:20:06,979 --> 00:20:10,643
These last few days people have been
selling Hangang Construction stocks non-stop.

254
00:20:10,758 --> 00:20:11,602
Selling?!

255
00:20:11,702 --> 00:20:14,593
For the time being, looks like it will
continue reaching the daily permissible low.

256
00:20:14,823 --> 00:20:17,270
If you plan to invest in the stock exchange,

257
00:20:17,356 --> 00:20:20,533
I suggest you don't bother
with Hangang Construction.

258
00:20:20,648 --> 00:20:24,120
You want to sell all your
Hangang Construction shares?

259
00:20:28,943 --> 00:20:30,518
How are our stocks faring right now?

260
00:20:30,632 --> 00:20:33,008
We closed today hitting
the daily permissible low again.

261
00:20:33,123 --> 00:20:35,341
The fire at the factory
can't possibly be the reason.

262
00:20:35,499 --> 00:20:37,913
I'm sure someone is
plotting something against us.

263
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:41,118
Ohh... A Manbo Construction employment a d?

264
00:20:45,757 --> 00:20:47,803
- Manbo Construction -

265
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,146
Sir.

266
00:21:01,882 --> 00:21:04,742
Why is that there?

267
00:21:12,686 --> 00:21:16,063
How could you let this get posted here?

268
00:21:16,164 --> 00:21:19,356
I apologize, Director Yeom.

269
00:21:27,581 --> 00:21:28,639
I've made you wait, didn't I?

270
00:21:28,725 --> 00:21:30,901
Nah, I just got here.

271
00:21:31,087 --> 00:21:32,518
Did you look into it?

272
00:21:32,704 --> 00:21:34,150
What's the reason?

273
00:21:34,365 --> 00:21:36,669
Who's trying to damage
our share price on purpose?

274
00:21:36,769 --> 00:21:40,479
There were rumors spreading
at the stock exchange.

275
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:42,079
Rumors?!

276
00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:46,831
That the government is secretly preparing
a list of ailing companies to be ousted.

277
00:21:47,357 --> 00:21:50,395
And you're telling me Hangang
Construction is on that list?

278
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:53,930
It's pretty much
accepted as fact by now.

279
00:21:56,171 --> 00:21:58,807
Jo Minwoo, that son of a bitch!

280
00:22:00,726 --> 00:22:01,612
Gangmo.

281
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:04,761
It's already too late to
deal with those rumors.

282
00:22:05,792 --> 00:22:08,869
If this keeps going on
for another few days,

283
00:22:09,774 --> 00:22:12,505
you'll cross a river of no return.

284
00:22:18,276 --> 00:22:20,421
Get all the capital we
have and start buying shares.

285
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:22,959
What money could we possibly have?

286
00:22:23,253 --> 00:22:27,922
Just a look at the construction
sites will make you lose sleep.

287
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:30,762
Don't you remember how Jo Minwoo
gained control of Manbo Construction?

288
00:22:30,883 --> 00:22:31,805
Gangmo...

289
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:33,995
If share prices go any lower,
Jo Minwoo will buy them,

290
00:22:34,095 --> 00:22:36,637
and then he will steal
Hangang Construction from us!

291
00:22:36,808 --> 00:22:38,146
All right.

292
00:22:38,346 --> 00:22:40,736
We'll try to do everything we can.

293
00:22:42,998 --> 00:22:44,000
This is serious.

294
00:22:44,086 --> 00:22:47,236
I think a group of employees
might hand their resignation.

295
00:22:47,336 --> 00:22:50,270
I overheard what they
were saying in the man's room,

296
00:22:50,413 --> 00:22:56,081
and I guess Manbo Construction is
hiring experienced workers or something.

297
00:22:56,225 --> 00:23:01,082
If they start stealing our
employees as well, it's all over!

298
00:23:03,719 --> 00:23:07,944
Immediately gather all employees
ranked section chief and above.

299
00:23:08,072 --> 00:23:09,890
All right.

300
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,626
Manbo Construction.

301
00:23:38,258 --> 00:23:41,883
I see their conditions
are quite favorable.

302
00:23:44,424 --> 00:23:46,005
By any chance,

303
00:23:47,638 --> 00:23:52,923
should anyone be interested
in joining them, I won't stop you.

304
00:23:53,109 --> 00:23:56,530
I'm sure they'll pay you even more.

305
00:23:56,687 --> 00:23:59,951
Particularly considering the
fact they're trying to damage us,

306
00:24:00,094 --> 00:24:02,384
if you say you come
from Hangang Construction,

307
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:04,631
you will receive even better treatment.

308
00:24:05,189 --> 00:24:07,434
But you can bet on this.

309
00:24:08,135 --> 00:24:14,719
That special treatment is what you'll
receive when you join us again in three years.

310
00:24:14,962 --> 00:24:19,056
If anyone has already written
their resignation or plans to do it,

311
00:24:19,199 --> 00:24:21,841
you're free to hand
them to me right now.

312
00:24:22,084 --> 00:24:24,303
And as for everyone else,

313
00:24:25,176 --> 00:24:29,713
I will listen to any idea on the
boiler that is currently under development.

314
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:32,376
Those receiving top honors will get
10 million won and a special promotion,

315
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:34,236
so give it your best.

316
00:24:34,422 --> 00:24:36,398
That would be all.

317
00:24:36,712 --> 00:24:40,852
Is it true that Hangang Construction
has been added to the list of ailing companies?

318
00:24:41,003 --> 00:24:42,809
Please, be honest with us.

319
00:24:42,997 --> 00:24:45,382
Is there such a possibility?

320
00:24:50,081 --> 00:24:51,678
Folks.

321
00:24:53,626 --> 00:24:55,754
In your estimation,

322
00:24:57,869 --> 00:25:00,676
is this Hangang Construction
of ours really an ailing company?

323
00:25:02,027 --> 00:25:03,878
The people Hangang Construction needs...

324
00:25:03,949 --> 00:25:05,171
are men and women
willing to solve problems...

325
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:07,755
and together sacrifice for
the good of the company!

326
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,629
Collect any resignation
they might hand you.

327
00:25:12,794 --> 00:25:14,286
All right.

328
00:25:33,489 --> 00:25:34,216
Chairman.

329
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:37,364
He's Director Woo Jaecheol of Bando Insurance.

330
00:25:37,931 --> 00:25:38,973
Come on in.

331
00:25:39,126 --> 00:25:40,782
- Have a seat, please.
- Yes.

332
00:25:46,464 --> 00:25:51,399
I hear you've incurred heavy losses because
of the fire at Hangang Construction's factory?

333
00:25:51,645 --> 00:25:53,419
It's always a possibility in our trade.

334
00:25:53,525 --> 00:25:55,605
So how are you dealing
with the insurance payments?

335
00:25:55,711 --> 00:25:58,060
Once the cause of the fire is officially...

336
00:25:58,107 --> 00:26:02,688
Suggest the possibility of a self-inflicted arson,
and postpone any payments.

337
00:26:02,829 --> 00:26:03,557
What?

338
00:26:03,651 --> 00:26:06,787
I'm sure news reports mentioned
the possibility of an arson?

339
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:08,912
That's certainly true, but...

340
00:26:09,049 --> 00:26:14,405
Along with Manbo Group, I can
influence the decisions of a few other companies.

341
00:26:15,873 --> 00:26:18,763
Just the right word from you,

342
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:23,351
and all those companies could
suddenly be convinced to knock at your door.

343
00:26:24,434 --> 00:26:29,235
All I need from you is to postpone
those payments until my further notice.

344
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:32,266
I'm sure that's not going to
be much of a problem for you?

345
00:26:36,555 --> 00:26:38,122
What is this supposed to mean?

346
00:26:38,345 --> 00:26:41,141
You're insinuating the possibility
that this arson was self-inflicted?

347
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:42,703
So you came, President Lee.

348
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:46,062
How can you refuse to pay because of that?

349
00:26:46,191 --> 00:26:48,085
I wasn't suggesting we wouldn't pay,

350
00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:51,468
just to wait until
our investigation is complete.

351
00:26:51,585 --> 00:26:53,262
And when will that be?

352
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:55,274
I can't really give you
any estimate on that...

353
00:26:55,344 --> 00:26:57,059
Look!

354
00:26:57,818 --> 00:26:59,922
How are you going to compensate us
for our shares hitting the bottom,

355
00:26:59,969 --> 00:27:02,154
while all that remains
of our factory is rubble?

356
00:27:02,624 --> 00:27:03,916
If we don't rebuild that factory right away,

357
00:27:03,986 --> 00:27:05,995
you know what kind of
losses we're going to incur?

358
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:08,544
The company has already
decided its policy on this case.

359
00:27:08,661 --> 00:27:10,776
I'm sorry, President Lee.

360
00:27:12,267 --> 00:27:14,032
Fine.

361
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,569
Investigate all you want.

362
00:27:17,015 --> 00:27:21,479
But should that investigation reveal
that it wasn't a self-inflicted arson,

363
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:26,058
you will be held responsible
for every single penny we lose!

364
00:27:38,707 --> 00:27:41,281
What did you want to talk about?

365
00:27:43,866 --> 00:27:46,587
I need investment funds.

366
00:27:48,969 --> 00:27:50,407
How much?

367
00:27:50,514 --> 00:27:55,182
Five bil... no.
The more, the better.

368
00:27:56,117 --> 00:27:58,354
Investment funds for what?

369
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:02,019
Why aren't you answering me?

370
00:28:03,495 --> 00:28:08,562
Hangang Construction stocks
have been plummeting for days.

371
00:28:08,867 --> 00:28:10,923
I'd like to buy them.

372
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:16,702
Hangang Construction was added
to the list of ailing companies.

373
00:28:16,843 --> 00:28:18,852
It's still only a rumor.

374
00:28:18,934 --> 00:28:20,762
Are you really sure of that?

375
00:28:20,868 --> 00:28:23,546
Once development for
their new boiler is complete,

376
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,930
their share price will rebound for sure.

377
00:28:26,107 --> 00:28:29,525
- So I thought it could be a good opportunity...
- Wake up!

378
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,569
Director...

379
00:28:31,698 --> 00:28:34,042
There are standards when it comes to investing.

380
00:28:34,265 --> 00:28:39,464
Don't you know that letting personal whims
affect your judgment will only ruin you?

381
00:28:40,296 --> 00:28:41,571
But...

382
00:28:42,628 --> 00:28:44,825
I believe in President Lee.

383
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:51,860
You were the first to tell me that a company's
greatest collateral is the people who run it.

384
00:28:54,541 --> 00:28:59,259
So if you don't trust President
Lee, at least trust me.

385
00:28:59,435 --> 00:29:01,549
I will act as his collateral.

386
00:29:03,828 --> 00:29:07,364
Are you telling me that
you don't even trust me?

387
00:29:07,587 --> 00:29:12,600
I don't want to lose you over this.

388
00:29:13,849 --> 00:29:16,922
If you really insist on helping President Lee,

389
00:29:18,121 --> 00:29:20,188
you can just leave me.

390
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:24,064
Since I will never betray my principles.

391
00:29:27,594 --> 00:29:29,473
I apologize.

392
00:29:52,362 --> 00:29:58,060
Ehh... I've really had it with this...

393
00:29:58,439 --> 00:29:59,598
President.

394
00:29:59,692 --> 00:30:00,937
Yeom Gyeongja.

395
00:30:01,043 --> 00:30:03,380
What are you doing here at this hour?

396
00:30:04,015 --> 00:30:06,821
They have no intention
of leaving, how can I?

397
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:07,913
What?

398
00:30:08,066 --> 00:30:10,685
Are you telling me our
employees are still here?

399
00:30:11,531 --> 00:30:17,510
So you're suggesting we
add a thermostat to the boiler, right?

400
00:30:17,639 --> 00:30:22,071
Yes, so that our customers will be able
to choose the temperature they prefer.

401
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:25,254
Nice... That's very good!

402
00:30:25,348 --> 00:30:27,823
So we'll take that...

403
00:30:28,011 --> 00:30:29,377
Chief Yoon, how about you?

404
00:30:29,471 --> 00:30:32,706
I'd like to focus on the
boiler's appearance first.

405
00:30:32,788 --> 00:30:35,149
Boilers in the past have only
focused on their functions,

406
00:30:35,219 --> 00:30:37,240
completely ignoring any design issue.

407
00:30:37,334 --> 00:30:40,200
And that is why I thought
we could approach our customers...

408
00:30:40,317 --> 00:30:43,606
with a fresher, more vivid design, while at the
same time conveying a sense of familiarity.

409
00:30:43,688 --> 00:30:48,952
- So you'd like to change the boiler's image.
- Yes.

410
00:30:50,386 --> 00:30:55,824
With people like these,
how could anyone go bust?

411
00:31:38,504 --> 00:31:40,604
What are you doing?

412
00:31:40,722 --> 00:31:42,038
Hey... You...

413
00:31:42,466 --> 00:31:44,164
Are you investigating on that case?

414
00:31:44,281 --> 00:31:45,691
What case?

415
00:31:46,254 --> 00:31:47,757
I know everything already.

416
00:31:47,849 --> 00:31:50,408
- At the Namyoung-Dong...
- Hey.

417
00:31:51,846 --> 00:31:53,632
Will you keep that mouth shut?

418
00:31:54,337 --> 00:31:55,828
I'm warning you,

419
00:31:55,996 --> 00:31:57,296
don't even think of getting in the way.

420
00:31:57,473 --> 00:31:58,835
Is that clear?

421
00:32:01,713 --> 00:32:04,808
But, where is Chief Lee?

422
00:32:08,379 --> 00:32:12,924
The opposition party members
are facing even tighter surveillance.

423
00:32:13,054 --> 00:32:21,012
If this keeps up, I wonder if we'll be able
to secure a quorum before the plenary session.

424
00:32:29,556 --> 00:32:31,659
Look at the bottom.

425
00:32:33,437 --> 00:32:35,822
- College Student Under
Investigation Dies from Shock -

426
00:32:35,998 --> 00:32:38,324
He died as a result of torture.

427
00:32:38,805 --> 00:32:43,152
And of course that article
covered up the facts to limit the damages.

428
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:51,527
Inside this briefcase you'll
find the truth about this case.

429
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:57,401
Consult the opposition
and leak this to the press.

430
00:32:57,930 --> 00:33:01,350
- You...
- If you can't reach that agreement politically,

431
00:33:01,644 --> 00:33:04,380
you'll have to ask
the people to help you.

432
00:33:05,285 --> 00:33:10,091
This kind of accident can be
the spark which ignites them.

433
00:33:33,772 --> 00:33:35,202
- Case Report -

434
00:34:08,517 --> 00:34:09,124
Saw them?

435
00:34:09,218 --> 00:34:10,369
Yeah, I did.

436
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:11,180
Who was that?

437
00:34:11,274 --> 00:34:13,576
Who is my father meeting?

438
00:34:14,436 --> 00:34:15,892
I think he might be quite handsome.

439
00:34:15,963 --> 00:34:17,161
What?!

440
00:34:18,947 --> 00:34:20,861
That's not what I asked you!

441
00:34:21,014 --> 00:34:22,964
Any description or
whether you've ever seen him.

442
00:34:23,058 --> 00:34:24,338
How am I supposed to know that?

443
00:34:24,467 --> 00:34:26,264
Aigoo... I ought to...

444
00:34:27,353 --> 00:34:30,241
Take this,

445
00:34:30,453 --> 00:34:33,142
and while pretending to shoot
the puppy, get him on camera.

446
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:34,716
What is all this, really?

447
00:34:34,834 --> 00:34:36,596
All right.

448
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:47,139
I shouldn't even
bother asking that idiot...

449
00:34:49,312 --> 00:34:53,633
It's an appraisal on other
companies we should add to the list.

450
00:34:58,002 --> 00:35:00,293
Hangang Construction?!

451
00:35:00,927 --> 00:35:04,064
So why should Hangang
Construction be ousted?

452
00:35:04,181 --> 00:35:05,908
A look at that and it'll be obvious,

453
00:35:06,131 --> 00:35:10,287
but right now both their share price
and cash flow situation are critical.

454
00:35:10,369 --> 00:35:13,576
I did hear about the
fire at their boiler factory,

455
00:35:13,799 --> 00:35:16,381
but I never really imagined
they'd be facing such issues...

456
00:35:16,474 --> 00:35:22,255
According to reports, they might not
even be able to complete their Suseo apartments.

457
00:35:22,384 --> 00:35:24,243
I think it would be wise to oust them immediately,

458
00:35:24,355 --> 00:35:26,719
and entrust the construction to other companies.

459
00:35:26,813 --> 00:35:28,539
I see it in a different light.

460
00:35:28,727 --> 00:35:33,349
In consideration of the character
shown by Hangang Construction so far,

461
00:35:33,572 --> 00:35:35,029
I'd be more inclined to
give them another chance...

462
00:35:35,088 --> 00:35:39,187
We're not here to
help companies in trouble.

463
00:35:39,528 --> 00:35:43,639
Are you ignoring the president's wish to get
rid of all the black sheep and save the economy?

464
00:35:43,745 --> 00:35:46,956
Look... How about we drop the
act and show some honesty?

465
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,611
Is this what you call saving the economy?

466
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,969
Aren't you just making an example out
of corporations who don't go along for the ride,

467
00:35:54,039 --> 00:35:55,684
trying to downplay the
effects of this lame-duck period?

468
00:35:55,754 --> 00:35:57,090
Watch your language.

469
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:01,309
Why don't you stop trying to
paper over the president's true motives?

470
00:36:01,388 --> 00:36:04,560
Shouldn't I know what
the purpose of this really is?

471
00:36:04,666 --> 00:36:10,834
Anyhow, Hangang Construction will
be ousted no matter what, just so you know.

472
00:36:29,756 --> 00:36:32,834
Have you had lunch?

473
00:36:43,428 --> 00:36:45,836
So I hear that list has become...

474
00:36:46,059 --> 00:36:49,956
the Holy Grail of the stock
exchange and many a corporation.

475
00:36:50,388 --> 00:36:51,683
I'm sure it has.

476
00:36:52,024 --> 00:36:57,967
So try to explain the reason why
Hangang Construction was mentioned there.

477
00:36:58,085 --> 00:37:00,822
I'm sure you know the
reason a lot better than me?!

478
00:37:00,916 --> 00:37:03,455
If you oust a company just
because of a few difficulties,

479
00:37:03,784 --> 00:37:07,272
how many companies will survive?

480
00:37:11,045 --> 00:37:16,832
You know why Baekpa's private-lending
cartel was torn to shreds?

481
00:37:17,478 --> 00:37:19,451
Because he refused to listen.

482
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:25,183
He chose the worst possible
target to raise some hackles.

483
00:37:25,301 --> 00:37:30,506
So I guess this worst
possible target would be you.

484
00:37:30,635 --> 00:37:34,899
Let's suppose there are a a
hundred hen inside a hencoop.

485
00:37:35,663 --> 00:37:39,927
It's up to the chef to choose
which ones will be slaughtered for dinner.

486
00:37:40,056 --> 00:37:41,989
They can cry and voice
their grievances all they want,

487
00:37:42,083 --> 00:37:46,217
but those poor hen have no such authority.

488
00:37:47,726 --> 00:37:49,589
Hen in the hencoop...

489
00:37:51,132 --> 00:37:53,312
Sure suits you.

490
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:56,376
Listen, President Lee.

491
00:37:57,562 --> 00:38:02,378
Why do you think I
agreed to have lunch with you?

492
00:38:04,024 --> 00:38:08,382
I was thinking I could
give you one last chance.

493
00:38:08,558 --> 00:38:09,592
I'm all ears.

494
00:38:09,686 --> 00:38:11,518
If my guess is right,

495
00:38:11,694 --> 00:38:14,631
there was a secret bipartisan agreement
on the constitutional amendment...

496
00:38:14,772 --> 00:38:19,459
at the last Olympics Support Committee event.

497
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:26,829
Who has that secret fund account?

498
00:38:28,535 --> 00:38:33,833
Don't you think that asking
me that is a bit foolish?

499
00:38:33,926 --> 00:38:38,436
Give me that account.

500
00:38:40,856 --> 00:38:43,945
What I'm proposing is to exchange
the Hangang Construction...

501
00:38:44,075 --> 00:38:46,483
you so dearly cherish with that account.

502
00:38:49,034 --> 00:38:51,307
If you're a businessman with brains,

503
00:38:51,401 --> 00:38:54,573
I think there is no reason why
you would refuse my offer?!

504
00:38:55,739 --> 00:38:57,145
Too bad.

505
00:38:57,838 --> 00:38:58,801
If I knew this,

506
00:38:58,895 --> 00:39:03,111
I would have set business aside
and focused on finding that account.

507
00:39:04,708 --> 00:39:08,397
If that account was in my possession,

508
00:39:08,608 --> 00:39:10,899
this discussion would have been different.

509
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:14,398
I guess I would have told you this.

510
00:39:19,238 --> 00:39:22,080
"If you think you can do that, be my guest."

511
00:39:22,386 --> 00:39:28,040
"Because I'll roll that account
and stick it down your throat."

512
00:39:28,745 --> 00:39:30,812
Like that?

513
00:39:35,275 --> 00:39:38,659
The secret fund account for that list...

514
00:39:41,323 --> 00:39:43,358
Should be quite the exciting fight.

515
00:39:43,863 --> 00:39:48,444
Of course, that is if I have that account.

516
00:39:52,092 --> 00:39:57,608
I see you're walking down the same
path which led Baekpa to his downfall.

517
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:04,433
You'll soon find out what kind of misery...

518
00:40:06,089 --> 00:40:08,833
the hen in the hencoop are consigned to.

519
00:40:32,108 --> 00:40:33,757
It's me, Director.

520
00:40:34,586 --> 00:40:35,930
Come in.

521
00:40:45,182 --> 00:40:46,338
How did it go?

522
00:40:46,479 --> 00:40:47,466
Did you find out?

523
00:40:47,583 --> 00:40:51,412
President Noh was pulling the strings
and affecting Hangang Construction's shares.

524
00:40:51,729 --> 00:40:53,115
Noh Gapsoo?!

525
00:40:53,233 --> 00:40:55,065
And it's not just Hangang Construction.

526
00:40:55,195 --> 00:40:59,603
These days President Noh is pouring
huge money into the stock exchange.

527
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:03,139
It's Jo Pilyeon.

528
00:41:03,315 --> 00:41:04,149
Excuse me?

529
00:41:04,243 --> 00:41:08,730
Noh Gapsoo is acting
under Jo Pilyeon's instructions.

530
00:41:08,895 --> 00:41:10,410
So why focus on the stock exchange...

531
00:41:10,516 --> 00:41:15,495
I guess they'll use the list of ailing
companies to manipulate the market.

532
00:41:17,268 --> 00:41:18,749
Keep looking into it.

533
00:41:19,141 --> 00:41:23,835
Find out which companies he's targeting,
and how much money he's investing.

534
00:41:24,012 --> 00:41:25,774
All right, Director.

535
00:41:28,451 --> 00:41:31,209
- Hangang Construction 1510 Won (per share) -

536
00:41:46,808 --> 00:41:49,761
- I'll be counting on you, then.
- Yes, thank you.

537
00:41:53,398 --> 00:41:55,536
Who is this?

538
00:41:59,074 --> 00:42:02,442
We meet here?!

539
00:42:02,642 --> 00:42:05,890
Here for some investment?

540
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:08,804
Well...

541
00:42:08,944 --> 00:42:12,190
Was thinking I could give
Hangang Construction a try.

542
00:42:13,422 --> 00:42:15,855
They're pretty much hopeless...

543
00:42:16,204 --> 00:42:17,966
They've been branded as an ailing company,

544
00:42:18,048 --> 00:42:20,237
and their exclusion has
been pretty much confirmed.

545
00:42:20,542 --> 00:42:22,304
Wow... Director Hwang.

546
00:42:22,398 --> 00:42:24,219
You're not as up to speed as I thought?!

547
00:42:24,325 --> 00:42:28,741
I hear you were the
one who spread that rumor?

548
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:31,924
So I guess I'm up to speed, after all?

549
00:42:32,006 --> 00:42:34,438
I'd watch what I say if I were you...

550
00:42:35,232 --> 00:42:38,760
Don't you know that your word is
everything in the private-lending market?

551
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:41,650
So that's what you used to
spread such false rumors?

552
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,294
Hey, Hwang Jeongyeon!

553
00:42:44,829 --> 00:42:48,742
I guess you believe your
mother still has any influence,

554
00:42:48,883 --> 00:42:50,880
but Director Yoo is about to go belly up.

555
00:42:51,408 --> 00:42:54,005
She already lost half her capital.

556
00:42:56,104 --> 00:42:58,255
It's all thanks to you.

557
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:03,529
Thanks to you, they took the IOU list
and the pledge from her,

558
00:43:04,527 --> 00:43:09,461
and the remaining half will
soon meet the same fate.

559
00:43:09,625 --> 00:43:15,489
We'll see if you'll keep prancing
around acting so smug when that happens.

560
00:43:19,824 --> 00:43:21,621
What is he saying?

561
00:43:21,738 --> 00:43:24,617
The director lost half her capital?!

562
00:43:24,726 --> 00:43:29,135
Find out her cash flow situation.

563
00:43:29,353 --> 00:43:30,923
Yes, Eonni.

564
00:43:39,139 --> 00:43:42,321
Anything of note?

565
00:43:42,832 --> 00:43:47,189
The boiler thermostat
might be our best option...

566
00:43:47,357 --> 00:43:48,633
But?

567
00:43:48,884 --> 00:43:52,826
It doesn't have the kind of impact
that would affect customer confidence.

568
00:43:54,365 --> 00:43:57,360
I'd rather choose something
related to the accident...

569
00:44:00,308 --> 00:44:03,836
You call that driving?

570
00:44:07,565 --> 00:44:08,840
Shideok.

571
00:44:08,945 --> 00:44:10,745
Push the horn again.

572
00:44:15,874 --> 00:44:17,637
One more time.

573
00:44:25,343 --> 00:44:27,617
Ahh... I can't eat this anymore, really.

574
00:44:27,770 --> 00:44:30,759
Are we going to keep eating
jjajangmyeon trapped in here?

575
00:44:30,889 --> 00:44:32,545
I told you!

576
00:44:32,697 --> 00:44:36,456
Before that is complete, we're
not going to leave this place.

577
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:39,762
Ahh... You're obsessed with that, all right.

578
00:44:40,101 --> 00:44:43,913
Hangang Construction will
survive only if we complete that.

579
00:44:44,018 --> 00:44:48,987
Or else we'll have to open a junk shop.

580
00:44:49,034 --> 00:44:51,659
Ehh... Eat yours, will you?

581
00:44:51,785 --> 00:44:53,907
How is everyone?

582
00:44:56,248 --> 00:44:59,208
- Are you having lunch?
- Want me to order some for you as well?

583
00:44:59,325 --> 00:45:01,557
No, go ahead.

584
00:45:04,444 --> 00:45:06,366
Did you add the thermostat?

585
00:45:06,472 --> 00:45:07,501
Yes.

586
00:45:07,689 --> 00:45:10,121
But... President.

587
00:45:10,246 --> 00:45:11,937
Even with that function added,

588
00:45:12,113 --> 00:45:17,751
you won't be able to wash away the stigma
of products of a factory which caught fire.

589
00:45:17,939 --> 00:45:23,318
There's a good possibility that Manbo
Construction will take our share of the market.

590
00:45:23,377 --> 00:45:26,724
Ahh... Here he goes again,
killing my appetite.

591
00:45:26,795 --> 00:45:30,307
So, what? We can work hard all
we want, but it still won't mean squat?

592
00:45:30,401 --> 00:45:32,269
How about we add another function?

593
00:45:32,351 --> 00:45:34,712
Is there anything else to add?

594
00:45:35,597 --> 00:45:41,412
I'd like to add something that would alert
customers when the boiler has a malfunction.

595
00:45:41,635 --> 00:45:42,963
Some kind of alarm system?

596
00:45:43,057 --> 00:45:44,513
The lion's share of customer complaints...

597
00:45:44,607 --> 00:45:47,790
dealt with their worries
about accidents and malfunctions.

598
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:51,469
Let's offer a way to
prevent such accidents.

599
00:45:51,551 --> 00:45:55,944
Hey... I get this feeling brewing inside...
Sotae, don't you feel the same?

600
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:57,107
Wait...

601
00:45:57,177 --> 00:46:03,053
In that case, we could use the
fire at the factory in our favor!

602
00:46:03,152 --> 00:46:07,517
A boiler warning against fires, made
by a factory which experienced it firsthand.

603
00:46:07,926 --> 00:46:08,843
Don't you think?

604
00:46:08,925 --> 00:46:11,016
How about it?
Would that be possible?

605
00:46:11,122 --> 00:46:12,179
We'll have to give it a try.

606
00:46:12,273 --> 00:46:14,282
Because if we manage to make it,

607
00:46:14,376 --> 00:46:18,020
it would clearly help us distance
ourselves from Manbo Construction.

608
00:46:18,114 --> 00:46:21,148
Gangmo... Gangmo.

609
00:46:21,541 --> 00:46:23,693
You'll have to come back to the office.

610
00:46:23,834 --> 00:46:24,633
What's the matter?

611
00:46:24,751 --> 00:46:28,547
A shareholder's meeting has been organized.

612
00:46:39,542 --> 00:46:41,069
What are you doing here?

613
00:46:41,184 --> 00:46:43,230
I was invited here,
so show me the way.

614
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:45,368
Invited?!

615
00:46:46,422 --> 00:46:49,982
How many company
shares have you been buying?

616
00:46:50,087 --> 00:46:51,570
Don't worry.

617
00:46:51,723 --> 00:46:54,570
Since they haven't reached
the price I want yet.

618
00:46:55,698 --> 00:46:58,352
Seems like your shareholders
have plenty of complaints.

619
00:46:58,552 --> 00:46:59,985
Good luck.

620
00:47:15,589 --> 00:47:16,964
President.

621
00:47:17,128 --> 00:47:20,194
Are you aware of the fact that rumors
about the company's impending collapse...

622
00:47:20,288 --> 00:47:23,198
are spreading both at the stock
exchange and in the private-lending sector?

623
00:47:23,327 --> 00:47:24,795
I am.

624
00:47:24,983 --> 00:47:25,794
And they're just rumors.

625
00:47:25,841 --> 00:47:29,975
The same shares worth 2000 won
last week have already lost 500 won.

626
00:47:30,081 --> 00:47:31,127
How do you plan to deal with this?

627
00:47:31,197 --> 00:47:33,563
Once the boiler we're
currently developing is complete,

628
00:47:33,657 --> 00:47:34,796
share prices will rebound.

629
00:47:34,890 --> 00:47:37,040
And when are you
going to rebuild the factory?

630
00:47:37,134 --> 00:47:42,044
Is it true that we will have a
net loss of 4.3 billion this year?

631
00:47:44,534 --> 00:47:46,622
When will they come?

632
00:47:47,370 --> 00:47:50,034
They should be here any minute.

633
00:47:51,573 --> 00:47:54,944
Please calm down, and listen to me.

634
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:59,337
I perfectly understand your anxiety.

635
00:48:00,053 --> 00:48:04,936
So I will take this opportunity
to make you a promise.

636
00:48:05,141 --> 00:48:07,016
From here on in...

637
00:48:16,824 --> 00:48:18,714
President Lee Gangmo?

638
00:48:19,710 --> 00:48:21,134
What is it?

639
00:48:22,159 --> 00:48:24,599
You'll have to follow us.

640
00:48:25,517 --> 00:48:26,520
What is the matter?

641
00:48:26,626 --> 00:48:29,304
You're under arrest
for business embezzlement.

642
00:48:35,001 --> 00:48:36,692
I'll come on my own two feet.

643
00:48:36,775 --> 00:48:38,349
What's going on?

644
00:48:38,443 --> 00:48:40,127
Why is the police arresting you?

645
00:48:40,174 --> 00:48:41,278
President...

646
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:43,999
Embezzlement... What goddamned
embezzlement are you talking about?

647
00:48:44,092 --> 00:48:45,906
Have you seen it?
Have you?

648
00:48:46,012 --> 00:48:47,363
Keep acting like this,

649
00:48:47,457 --> 00:48:49,712
and we'll enforce compulsory execution.

650
00:48:50,264 --> 00:48:51,991
No need to worry.

651
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:53,753
It'll be over in a moment.

652
00:48:53,929 --> 00:48:55,256
Let's go.

653
00:49:07,850 --> 00:49:11,527
You'll soon find out what kind of misery...

654
00:49:11,691 --> 00:49:14,240
the hen in the hencoop are consigned to.

655
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:30,567
Isn't the police station the other way?

656
00:49:30,697 --> 00:49:32,958
We're heading to our southern branch.

657
00:49:33,064 --> 00:49:34,884
Southern branch?

658
00:49:36,009 --> 00:49:39,736
So, what, you're prosecutors?

659
00:49:47,819 --> 00:49:51,437
It's her retrieval rate
for this fourth quarter.

660
00:49:52,189 --> 00:49:55,854
Most of the Jong-Ro business has
fallen under Noh Gapsoo's control.

661
00:49:56,042 --> 00:49:59,301
And Myeongdong is in no better shape.

662
00:50:00,284 --> 00:50:03,096
What is even more worrying is that
even the clients who decided to stay...

663
00:50:03,178 --> 00:50:05,246
are also dealing with President Noh.

664
00:50:05,351 --> 00:50:08,523
How could she let it get to
this point without saying a word...

665
00:50:08,617 --> 00:50:13,346
The director told me
not to tell you anything.

666
00:50:14,547 --> 00:50:18,761
She was worried this could bring you distress...

667
00:50:33,247 --> 00:50:34,727
Have a seat.

668
00:50:37,431 --> 00:50:41,213
I was about to come pay you a visit.

669
00:50:41,365 --> 00:50:42,775
Shall we have a drink?

670
00:50:42,939 --> 00:50:47,861
No... I wanted to
have a word with you.

671
00:50:48,002 --> 00:50:52,480
You told me you needed
investment funds, right?

672
00:50:52,731 --> 00:50:55,734
So that you could buy
Hangang Construction shares.

673
00:50:56,153 --> 00:50:58,260
I'll take care of that.

674
00:50:58,718 --> 00:51:02,644
Sorry for making you worry about nothing.

675
00:51:05,936 --> 00:51:07,910
First, start with this.

676
00:51:08,133 --> 00:51:11,234
I gathered five billion in a rush.

677
00:51:11,814 --> 00:51:12,902
Director...

678
00:51:13,019 --> 00:51:15,615
If you really want to control
those Hangang Construction shares,

679
00:51:15,803 --> 00:51:19,615
this will make no difference.

680
00:51:20,207 --> 00:51:23,813
You'll soon get an additional
ten billion on top of that.

681
00:51:23,965 --> 00:51:25,340
This is not really neces...

682
00:51:25,516 --> 00:51:28,264
No, just don't do it, Director.

683
00:51:30,097 --> 00:51:33,432
I know what kind of cash
flow issues you're facing.

684
00:51:33,737 --> 00:51:39,622
As you said, a wrong investment done this
way and the whole organization could collapse.

685
00:51:39,751 --> 00:51:41,079
That's right.

686
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:48,709
I'm putting the entire organization
on the line for this investment.

687
00:51:48,974 --> 00:51:49,890
What?

688
00:51:50,054 --> 00:51:53,296
Once the government publishes
their list of ousted companies,

689
00:51:53,684 --> 00:51:56,825
pandemonium is going
to hit the stock exchange.

690
00:51:57,002 --> 00:52:02,053
Noh Gapsoo is pouring huge sums
into it, as if it was his last resort.

691
00:52:02,487 --> 00:52:07,503
And Hangang Construction is his first bait.

692
00:52:08,243 --> 00:52:14,549
So you're fighting with
your back to the wall as well?

693
00:52:16,922 --> 00:52:23,964
If this keeps up, the rest of the organization
will fall under President Noh's control anyway.

694
00:52:27,785 --> 00:52:31,824
You said you believe in President Lee, right?

695
00:52:33,716 --> 00:52:36,281
So I'll believe in you.

696
00:52:37,193 --> 00:52:42,178
My collateral for this
investment is you, Jeongyeon.

697
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:46,007
But bear this in mind.

698
00:52:46,477 --> 00:52:51,320
Our destiny depends on this fight.

699
00:52:53,563 --> 00:52:55,149
I will...

700
00:52:56,230 --> 00:52:58,638
I will succeed at all cost.

701
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:03,249
I will succeed, and
help the people I lo...

702
00:53:07,242 --> 00:53:12,787
And help the people
I like succeed as well.

703
00:53:22,082 --> 00:53:25,735
President Lee was arrested by prosecutors.

704
00:53:41,714 --> 00:53:43,080
Here.

705
00:53:43,516 --> 00:53:45,296
Let's begin.

706
00:53:46,459 --> 00:53:48,926
Did you say it was business embezzlement?

707
00:53:49,689 --> 00:53:51,533
The reason why you arrested me.

708
00:53:52,717 --> 00:53:54,834
You refused to nominate a lawyer.

709
00:53:54,928 --> 00:53:56,503
I didn't commit any crime,

710
00:53:56,609 --> 00:53:59,087
so why would I need legal counsel?

711
00:54:00,086 --> 00:54:03,856
Nobody who comes here
openly confesses his crimes.

712
00:54:04,162 --> 00:54:05,830
Let's start.

713
00:54:06,775 --> 00:54:08,030
Here... What shall we start from?

714
00:54:08,171 --> 00:54:09,451
A tax audit?

715
00:54:09,756 --> 00:54:11,859
Or maybe site supervision?

716
00:54:12,129 --> 00:54:13,210
Right...

717
00:54:13,398 --> 00:54:16,957
A look at special loan benefits
would probably be better.

718
00:54:26,112 --> 00:54:28,276
Ahh... Myeongwol, foolish wench...

719
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:30,766
And you call this a photo?

720
00:54:31,001 --> 00:54:34,184
Ahh... I have no idea who this is...

721
00:54:56,697 --> 00:54:59,445
Are... Are you done?

722
00:54:59,717 --> 00:55:01,431
Let's go.

723
00:55:13,070 --> 00:55:15,666
They're still following us?!

724
00:55:15,737 --> 00:55:17,475
Don't mind them.

725
00:55:18,297 --> 00:55:21,821
But, where are we going?

726
00:55:26,534 --> 00:55:28,008
Yes.

727
00:55:28,372 --> 00:55:30,721
Did you meet with Congressman Jang?

728
00:55:31,038 --> 00:55:32,753
Yes, just now.

729
00:55:33,752 --> 00:55:36,195
I was feeling nervous as of late,

730
00:55:36,289 --> 00:55:39,320
but he told me to have faith, you know.

731
00:55:39,378 --> 00:55:41,700
It all depends on you, Chairman.

732
00:55:41,794 --> 00:55:43,756
Don't you worry.

733
00:55:44,308 --> 00:55:46,093
I'll call you again.

734
00:56:00,913 --> 00:56:02,654
How long have you been here?

735
00:56:03,296 --> 00:56:04,787
Buy me lunch.

736
00:56:04,917 --> 00:56:06,397
I'm so hungry...

737
00:56:06,549 --> 00:56:09,306
Did you come in to
earn yourself a free meal?

738
00:56:09,952 --> 00:56:13,946
Then, what? There's nothing
else for me to do...

739
00:56:15,468 --> 00:56:16,237
Seonbaenim!

740
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:20,222
Have you been to this new
tonkatsu place down the street?

741
00:56:20,421 --> 00:56:22,488
It's to die for!

742
00:56:22,756 --> 00:56:24,207
Seonbaenim!

743
00:56:25,414 --> 00:56:27,704
Their investigation
will last 48 hours at worst.

744
00:56:27,821 --> 00:56:29,583
Don't worry, Miju.

745
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,146
And the company?

746
00:56:31,345 --> 00:56:35,127
I've heard that Manbo
Construction could gain control of it.

747
00:56:35,245 --> 00:56:37,430
That's our biggest concern.

748
00:56:38,146 --> 00:56:40,554
We can try to stop
stocks from plummeting,

749
00:56:40,695 --> 00:56:44,160
but if it's added to the list
of ousted companies, it's all over.

750
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,677
So all we need to do is
convince Congressman Oh Byeongtak?

751
00:56:46,759 --> 00:56:49,355
With Jo Pilyeon by his
side, that'll be impossible.

752
00:56:49,496 --> 00:56:50,976
Although I guess postponing
the announcement would do it.

753
00:56:51,059 --> 00:56:54,453
Then, we'll have to try everything
we can to make them postpone it.

754
00:56:55,106 --> 00:56:57,918
Director Yoo met him because of that,

755
00:57:00,033 --> 00:57:02,540
but there was no
convincing Congressman Oh.

756
00:57:03,069 --> 00:57:04,349
Then,

757
00:57:05,383 --> 00:57:08,742
does it mean that there is
no hope for Hangang Construction?

758
00:57:10,359 --> 00:57:12,873
We need to fight to the end.

759
00:57:16,069 --> 00:57:18,194
Let me ask you just one thing.

760
00:57:18,429 --> 00:57:22,294
Congressman Oh and Deputy
Mayor Han Myeongseok looked really close.

761
00:57:22,482 --> 00:57:24,044
Is that true?

762
00:57:24,596 --> 00:57:26,172
Why are you asking?

763
00:57:26,561 --> 00:57:28,251
Tell me, please.

764
00:57:31,689 --> 00:57:39,321
I believe in the word of God,
his wisdom and sense of justice.

765
00:57:44,196 --> 00:57:46,287
By the way...

766
00:57:46,392 --> 00:57:50,386
When did Dad start going to church?

767
00:57:51,761 --> 00:57:55,716
This is all to make a
decent man out of you.

768
00:57:56,035 --> 00:57:58,065
So just pray.

769
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:11,791
Head to the Myeongdong Cathedral.

770
00:58:11,923 --> 00:58:14,434
Getting the Catholic Priests'
Association for Justice involved...

771
00:58:14,587 --> 00:58:18,440
and using their help to leak
this to the press would be our best option.

772
00:58:28,128 --> 00:58:31,123
In the name of the Father, the
Son, and the Holy Spirit.

773
00:58:31,447 --> 00:58:32,466
Amen.

774
00:58:32,548 --> 00:58:36,178
May the grace of the Holy Spirit fill
your heart with light,

775
00:58:36,354 --> 00:58:40,959
so that you may confess your sins with
loving trust and come to know that God is merciful.

776
00:58:42,149 --> 00:58:47,454
A few days ago at the
Namyoung-Dong Anti-Communist unit,

777
00:58:48,124 --> 00:58:50,778
a young college student passed away.

778
00:58:51,518 --> 00:58:55,747
The police treated it as
an unpremeditated homicide,

779
00:58:55,947 --> 00:58:57,705
but in fact,

780
00:58:58,152 --> 00:59:00,572
it was a cruel and
cold-blooded act of murder,

781
00:59:00,853 --> 00:59:03,567
perpetrated by a number
of people while torturing him.

782
00:59:05,821 --> 00:59:10,039
Here are the documents regarding that case.

783
00:59:13,916 --> 00:59:17,028
Refute the claims made by
public power to cover the truth,

784
00:59:17,416 --> 00:59:21,445
and let our people
know what truly happened.

785
00:59:36,146 --> 00:59:38,040
- College Student Under
Investigation Dies from Shock -

786
01:00:00,370 --> 01:00:06,167
Congressman Oh and Deputy Han
are closer than most brothers.

787
01:00:06,448 --> 01:00:09,103
I know what you're worried about.

788
01:00:09,467 --> 01:00:11,734
But trust me just this once.

789
01:00:12,069 --> 01:00:17,402
Would Deputy Han be able
to convince Congressman Oh?

790
01:00:18,364 --> 01:00:19,927
Perhaps.

791
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:23,780
If there is anyone who can convince him,

792
01:00:24,050 --> 01:00:27,104
that can only be Deputy Han.

793
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:55,536
So International Group is
going through liquidation?

794
01:00:55,701 --> 01:00:57,671
This is carnage.

795
01:00:57,977 --> 01:00:59,821
Now that we're approaching
the end of this regime,

796
01:00:59,927 --> 01:01:01,924
they're starting to show their teeth.

797
01:01:05,765 --> 01:01:07,068
It must be hard to bear.

798
01:01:07,151 --> 01:01:09,439
It doesn't stop at that.

799
01:01:09,557 --> 01:01:14,713
Not to mention that Jo Pilyeon
is completely obsessed over this...

800
01:01:15,406 --> 01:01:18,871
So what will happen
to Hangang Construction?

801
01:01:19,133 --> 01:01:21,702
If the data Jo Pilyeon sent me is legit,

802
01:01:22,008 --> 01:01:24,351
they'll inevitably have to be ousted.

803
01:01:25,425 --> 01:01:27,158
It's a shame...

804
01:01:27,287 --> 01:01:32,761
It's really a waste to see someone
like President Lee go down this way.

805
01:01:33,801 --> 01:01:35,134
Yes.

806
01:01:40,161 --> 01:01:42,816
Aigoo... Isn't this Cha Soojeong?

807
01:01:43,968 --> 01:01:47,691
What are you doing here, Soojeong?

808
01:01:48,066 --> 01:01:50,604
How have you been, Congressman?

809
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:54,880
Deputy.

810
01:02:02,738 --> 01:02:05,169
About President Lee Gangmo.

811
01:02:06,014 --> 01:02:08,634
We really can't find anything.

812
01:02:10,545 --> 01:02:11,759
Really?

813
01:02:11,935 --> 01:02:14,472
No signs of tax evasion,

814
01:02:14,905 --> 01:02:17,935
not to mention any trace of illegal loans.

815
01:02:18,804 --> 01:02:23,068
The investigation can
only last 48 hours, right?

816
01:02:23,186 --> 01:02:26,745
Yes, he must be released afterwards.

817
01:02:26,921 --> 01:02:30,400
Then, release him and arrest him again.

818
01:02:30,584 --> 01:02:33,058
We don't have all that time to waste.

819
01:02:33,257 --> 01:02:37,592
I hear you'll soon open your law firm?

820
01:02:37,897 --> 01:02:41,282
Since you're leaving the
prosecutor's office for good,

821
01:02:41,481 --> 01:02:44,406
shouldn't you make a little money on the side?

822
01:02:55,808 --> 01:02:57,116
Let's take a break.

823
01:02:57,222 --> 01:03:03,213
I'm sure that by now,
Congressman Jo Pilyeon will be here.

824
01:03:04,965 --> 01:03:10,419
Tell him to come
see me, while he's here.

825
01:03:11,863 --> 01:03:14,600
If you tell him I have a certain account,

826
01:03:16,386 --> 01:03:20,259
he'll run here drooling like a rabid dog.

827
01:03:25,743 --> 01:03:27,495
Go tell him.

828
01:03:28,493 --> 01:03:30,349
That Lee Gangmo...

829
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:34,016
has the account he's looking for.

830

Why don't you get out
of this while you still can?

837
01:03:59,137 --> 01:04:00,692
You really think you can beat me?

838
01:04:00,763 --> 01:04:03,476
Gather all the capital you can.

839
01:04:03,558 --> 01:04:05,097
I said find all the money we have left!

840
01:04:05,226 --> 01:04:07,071
I can't see you anymore from now on.

841
01:04:07,176 --> 01:04:09,854
Because I'm not your father.

842
01:04:09,948 --> 01:04:12,450
Why is Jo Pilyeon bothering you?

843
01:04:12,556 --> 01:04:13,797
And what about Jo Minwoo?

844
01:04:13,867 --> 01:04:16,029
Thank you for setting our factory on fire.

845
01:04:16,123 --> 01:04:17,462
You will lose because of that.

846
01:04:17,544 --> 01:04:19,376
There are only three days left, Lee Gangmo.

847
01:04:19,470 --> 01:04:22,712
In three days, that'll be
worth less than toilet paper.

848
01:04:22,830 --> 01:04:24,968
Can you finish our boiler in three days?

849
01:04:25,050 --> 01:04:27,849
I said it must be completed in three days!
