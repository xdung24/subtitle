Episode 48

4
00:00:15,137 --> 00:00:16,666
Seonhwa.

5
00:00:16,823 --> 00:00:20,000
Go find out if Minwoo's gone.

6
00:00:21,988 --> 00:00:25,104
Is there a reason
why I shouldn't be here?

7
00:00:32,057 --> 00:00:35,086
Is this all because I was bothering you?

8
00:00:35,382 --> 00:00:37,567
It's not that.

9
00:00:41,946 --> 00:00:43,561
It's cold medicine.

10
00:00:43,732 --> 00:00:45,366
Take it.

11
00:00:49,767 --> 00:00:51,412
We postponed the shoot to tomorrow.

12
00:00:51,536 --> 00:00:53,645
You can go home.

13
00:00:55,097 --> 00:01:00,442
Please, find yourself
another model while you still can.

14
00:01:04,545 --> 00:01:08,525
And why should I give up on
an up and coming star like you?

15
00:01:09,794 --> 00:01:12,220
If that's what you wish,

16
00:01:13,475 --> 00:01:16,859
we can keep all this
strictly business-related.

17
00:01:17,429 --> 00:01:21,554
I'll do everything I can
not to create any unnecessary burden.

18
00:01:25,273 --> 00:01:27,261
Lee Miju.

19
00:01:28,812 --> 00:01:32,112
You know how hard I'm trying
to endure all this in silence?

20
00:01:33,001 --> 00:01:35,412
Do you even realize how painful
it is to just stand here...

21
00:01:35,525 --> 00:01:38,860
without even being able to touch you?

22
00:01:55,066 --> 00:01:57,350
Miju...

23
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,835
Take good care of yourself.

24
00:02:10,216 --> 00:02:13,093
There's a shoot you can't miss tomorrow.

25
00:03:02,076 --> 00:03:04,013
Thirsty, aren't you?

26
00:03:04,831 --> 00:03:09,372
I've heard that people can
only last a week without water.

27
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:16,310
So I guess you have
about four days left to live?!

28
00:03:17,608 --> 00:03:19,991
The only way you'll get out of here...

29
00:03:20,132 --> 00:03:25,871
is on a stretcher after you're dead,
or if you tell us where that account is.

30
00:03:27,064 --> 00:03:29,052
Park Seonbae...

31
00:03:35,003 --> 00:03:37,781
Go to hell.

32
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:53,980
- Ohh...
- Sir.

33
00:03:54,085 --> 00:03:55,427
I bet I've made you wait?!

34
00:03:55,536 --> 00:03:58,173
I had this urgent meeting
with some businessmen.

35
00:03:58,266 --> 00:03:59,978
I just arrived myself, Congressman Min.

36
00:04:00,091 --> 00:04:01,981
Drop that "Congressman," please.

37
00:04:02,094 --> 00:04:03,694
Just call me seonbaenim.

38
00:04:03,789 --> 00:04:05,285
Yes.

39
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:10,497
You know who that is?

40
00:04:10,611 --> 00:04:15,114
Can't really say
I'm familiar with him?!

41
00:04:17,719 --> 00:04:21,992
We can't waste all this time
trying to track Min Honggi alone.

42
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:23,824
Seongmo won't resist that long.

43
00:04:23,913 --> 00:04:25,618
What do you plan to do?

44
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,016
Whatever he's hiding, we need
to force the cat out of the bag.

45
00:04:33,408 --> 00:04:37,867
You always had an interest
in politics, if I recall correctly?

46
00:04:38,732 --> 00:04:40,057
I've long given up on it.

47
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,199
What are you saying?

48
00:04:42,462 --> 00:04:46,251
People always
get three big chances in life.

49
00:04:46,392 --> 00:04:49,289
You catch one and
it'll pave the way to success.

50
00:04:51,025 --> 00:04:55,339
I'd like to give you
one of those opportunities.

51
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,146
What can I do for you in return?

52
00:04:59,934 --> 00:05:02,807
I'm glad you're
so quick on your feet.

53
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:09,082
There is someone I'd like
you to discreetly investigate on.

54
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,280
And who is that?

55
00:05:10,421 --> 00:05:12,677
He's this fella called Hwang Taeseop.

56
00:05:12,978 --> 00:05:18,514
He's aware of the secret
fund account's whereabouts.

57
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:23,453
Are you suggesting that he's
in cahoots with Lee Seongmo?

58
00:05:23,559 --> 00:05:28,351
He had a past on top of a
corporation, so he won't be easy to handle.

59
00:05:30,313 --> 00:05:31,884
Who's there?

60
00:05:40,013 --> 00:05:43,114
A man told me to give this to you...

61
00:05:55,024 --> 00:05:58,204
I have what you're looking for.

62
00:05:58,396 --> 00:06:03,067
If you want that account,
let's meet here in two days, same time.

63
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:06,710
But you must come alone.

64
00:06:21,626 --> 00:06:24,363
Could this come from Hwang Taeseop?

65
00:06:25,573 --> 00:06:29,178
He's the most cunning snake you could find.

66
00:06:29,706 --> 00:06:33,038
There is no way he would just give me
that account asking nothing in return.

67
00:06:33,177 --> 00:06:35,735
So is he just trying to test me?

68
00:06:35,861 --> 00:06:37,118
I can't say.

69
00:06:37,635 --> 00:06:42,973
Whatever he's plotting... Deploy a
few of your best men here in two days.

70
00:06:43,179 --> 00:06:45,052
Be careful not to be spotted.

71
00:06:45,246 --> 00:06:46,703
All right.

72
00:06:47,384 --> 00:06:48,672
Seonbaenim.

73
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,497
I was curious about something.

74
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:56,578
What will you use that account for,
once you get your hands on it?

75
00:06:58,445 --> 00:07:01,493
Whether I'll just use it to hit Jo Pilyeon,

76
00:07:01,624 --> 00:07:05,437
or to become the hero
our people are clamoring for,

77
00:07:05,535 --> 00:07:08,389
we'll have to wait and see.

78
00:08:00,066 --> 00:08:02,702
I'm so sorry... I was just...

79
00:08:06,261 --> 00:08:07,764
Are you going already?

80
00:08:07,823 --> 00:08:09,961
Ahh... This...

81
00:08:29,817 --> 00:08:31,755
How much is this book?

82
00:08:37,052 --> 00:08:38,744
Quick.

83
00:08:42,676 --> 00:08:43,686
Park Hoyong.

84
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,753
He's a chief at the Department
of Planning and Coordination.

85
00:08:45,836 --> 00:08:49,770
He's the man who took Chief
Lee to the Seobinggo Bunker.

86
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:53,894
So we can't trust Min Honggi, either.

87
00:08:56,185 --> 00:08:58,534
Now that we know his true colors,

88
00:08:58,863 --> 00:09:03,115
we'll have to choose
whether to just abandon him,

89
00:09:04,936 --> 00:09:07,206
or use him instead.

90
00:09:17,942 --> 00:09:21,882
Cha Soojeong has missed her shoot once again.

91
00:09:24,384 --> 00:09:26,369
I guess that her cold might be to blame.

92
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:31,760
They're opening a
shoe store in Gangnam,

93
00:09:32,121 --> 00:09:33,859
and she is there right now.

94
00:09:34,611 --> 00:09:35,762
A shoe store?

95
00:09:35,915 --> 00:09:39,261
She might be trying to
associate her image with this store,

96
00:09:39,451 --> 00:09:42,998
and use it to raise enough funds to
pay back the rest of the money.

97
00:09:57,331 --> 00:09:58,982
Why didn't you tell me?

98
00:09:59,105 --> 00:10:00,748
I... I apologize.

99
00:10:00,854 --> 00:10:04,009
It all happened while
you were busy, so...

100
00:10:04,138 --> 00:10:07,525
I'm only letting this slide because
it won't hurt Soojeong's image.

101
00:10:07,802 --> 00:10:09,578
From now on,
always report to me first.

102
00:10:09,698 --> 00:10:11,606
A... All right.

103
00:10:11,857 --> 00:10:16,814
Crystal's shoes convey
a feeling of happy love.

104
00:10:16,966 --> 00:10:20,525
Right now designer shoes
are being imported from Italy,

105
00:10:20,643 --> 00:10:21,900
but within the next ten years,

106
00:10:22,005 --> 00:10:25,797
Crystal's shoes will have secured
nine-figure export contracts to Italy.

107
00:10:25,914 --> 00:10:28,158
You sure don't lack confidence.

108
00:10:28,334 --> 00:10:29,978
You'd know just by trying them on,

109
00:10:30,025 --> 00:10:33,103
but our shoes are truly
comfortable and pretty.

110
00:10:33,196 --> 00:10:34,664
Cha Soojeong.

111
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:37,799
We don't really know
anything about you,

112
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:42,920
are you by any chance experiencing
the same "happy love" these shoes convey?

113
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:44,460
I'm sorry,

114
00:10:44,587 --> 00:10:49,122
but let's only talk about the shoes for today.

115
00:10:51,403 --> 00:10:56,129
- Crystal Shoes Launching Event -

116
00:11:01,704 --> 00:11:04,835
Chairman. Aren't you going in?

117
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,649
Miju is smiling...

118
00:11:06,813 --> 00:11:07,941
Excuse me?

119
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:14,225
It's the first time I see
her smile since we broke up.

120
00:11:17,091 --> 00:11:22,350
I tried so hard to make her smile...

121
00:11:25,545 --> 00:11:28,082
If I go inside right now,

122
00:11:29,457 --> 00:11:35,750
Miju won't smile anymore.

123
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:38,335
Chairman.

124
00:11:54,353 --> 00:11:59,824
Miss Lee called a few times, saying
she'd pay the rest of the money.

125
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:05,507
Chairman.

126
00:12:05,628 --> 00:12:07,203
You've had enough to drink.

127
00:12:07,328 --> 00:12:10,500
- Why don't you...
- Let her do that.

128
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:15,199
But the company is incurring
substantial losses because of her.

129
00:12:15,315 --> 00:12:18,570
- Asking for damages...
- Don't do it.

130
00:12:21,894 --> 00:12:24,711
I made a mistake
approaching things this way.

131
00:12:26,262 --> 00:12:30,843
This would have never
changed her mind anyway...

132
00:12:34,214 --> 00:12:36,328
Return all the money
she already paid back.

133
00:12:36,469 --> 00:12:37,614
What?

134
00:12:37,818 --> 00:12:41,224
Even the money she already paid?

135
00:12:46,369 --> 00:12:48,171
All right, Chairman.

136
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:53,027
What did you find about how
Miju spent the last four years?

137
00:12:53,135 --> 00:12:54,281
They're still investigating.

138
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:56,800
I think I might have a report
ready for you very soon.

139
00:12:56,925 --> 00:12:59,180
Tell them to hurry up.

140
00:12:59,481 --> 00:13:02,527
If I can find out how
she lived all these years,

141
00:13:02,788 --> 00:13:05,360
it might help me to convince her.

142
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:10,466
May I ask you just one thing?

143
00:13:11,844 --> 00:13:16,755
Why does it have to be Lee Miju?

144
00:13:16,953 --> 00:13:22,463
Someone like you could
easily find another woman...

145
00:13:37,972 --> 00:13:40,051
Other than Miju,

146
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:44,677
I have no eyes for anyone else.

147
00:13:45,805 --> 00:13:47,250
What?

148
00:13:47,591 --> 00:13:53,734
Right when I was
wondering why I even existed,

149
00:13:55,795 --> 00:13:58,144
that's when I met her.

150
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:04,228
She made me fall in love with her,

151
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:10,060
and gave me a reason to keep living.

152
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,700
Let's stop this.

153
00:15:10,414 --> 00:15:12,281
I was told you called.

154
00:15:14,255 --> 00:15:16,746
Saying you'd pay back
the rest of the money.

155
00:15:19,436 --> 00:15:21,210
Please go back.

156
00:15:23,359 --> 00:15:26,355
There's no need to
pay back that money.

157
00:15:29,082 --> 00:15:31,161
What do you mean by that?

158
00:15:31,901 --> 00:15:35,108
Are you really planning
to ask for damages?

159
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,639
Miju...

160
00:15:52,706 --> 00:15:54,441
Miju...

161
00:15:54,923 --> 00:15:56,136
Miju!

162
00:15:56,332 --> 00:15:57,886
Let go!

163
00:15:58,047 --> 00:16:00,314
I said let go!

164
00:16:26,329 --> 00:16:27,778
Try to do this again...

165
00:16:27,883 --> 00:16:29,572
And you'll do what?

166
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:32,014
Will you report me to the police?

167
00:16:32,302 --> 00:16:34,725
Might just do it.

168
00:16:35,335 --> 00:16:37,473
Do you really mean that?

169
00:16:39,552 --> 00:16:41,409
Don't you even
think about your future?

170
00:16:41,518 --> 00:16:46,919
Still better than being
harassed by someone you dislike.

171
00:16:51,911 --> 00:16:54,061
You mean it?

172
00:16:55,694 --> 00:16:58,254
Have you grown such dislike for me?

173
00:16:59,786 --> 00:17:01,715
And why...

174
00:17:03,407 --> 00:17:07,189
You said it wasn't
because of my father, so why?

175
00:17:12,451 --> 00:17:17,300
There's no particular reason why
people just stop liking someone.

176
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:28,312
I don't want to see you again.

177
00:18:59,936 --> 00:19:04,190
We'll have to stop
investigating Lee Seongmo.

178
00:19:04,459 --> 00:19:05,840
What is that supposed to mean?

179
00:19:06,056 --> 00:19:07,711
And you'd stop with nothing on our hands?

180
00:19:07,806 --> 00:19:12,120
You know how many people give me
stares for tormenting an innocent colleague?

181
00:19:12,238 --> 00:19:15,127
You're working on
behalf of the president here.

182
00:19:15,233 --> 00:19:16,979
Just ignore what other people think of this.

183
00:19:17,092 --> 00:19:19,861
Lee Seongmo is going to
endure this to the very end.

184
00:19:20,037 --> 00:19:22,281
If he ends up dying, who's
going to take responsibility?

185
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:25,594
- Look, Chief Oh.
- Make up your mind within two days,

186
00:19:25,783 --> 00:19:27,946
or find your evidence before then.

187
00:19:28,056 --> 00:19:31,256
Or else, I'll release him personally.

188
00:19:31,539 --> 00:19:34,206
That...

189
00:19:34,794 --> 00:19:38,355
What is he ever going to
accomplish with so little courage...

190
00:19:38,731 --> 00:19:43,359
Honestly, I don't understand
what you're doing myself.

191
00:19:43,676 --> 00:19:44,855
Now you start as well?

192
00:19:44,982 --> 00:19:49,710
Had I been in Seongmo's shoes,
would you have done the same?

193
00:19:49,878 --> 00:19:51,969
I don't want to suspect him, either.

194
00:19:52,173 --> 00:19:55,807
But he's the only one capable of that.

195
00:19:56,037 --> 00:19:58,677
- Still, Seongmo...
- suspicion...

196
00:19:58,857 --> 00:20:00,767
It often has a life of its own.

197
00:20:00,892 --> 00:20:03,191
Once it manifests itself,
it can only keep growing.

198
00:20:04,734 --> 00:20:07,010
The reason why I keep
pushing this to the end...

199
00:20:07,386 --> 00:20:12,671
is because I want to be
able to trust Seongmo again.

200
00:20:20,598 --> 00:20:22,134
That was really good?!

201
00:20:22,243 --> 00:20:23,616
I've had a great time, Hyungnim!

202
00:20:23,709 --> 00:20:27,294
You think? You stuffed yourself
with all those expensive dishes...

203
00:20:27,364 --> 00:20:29,655
Let's do this more often, shall we?

204
00:20:29,713 --> 00:20:33,425
Aigoo... Whomever ends up marrying
you will have to sweat to handle the missus.

205
00:20:33,543 --> 00:20:36,923
So? Why would you worry about that?

206
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,930
Nothing to report yet.

207
00:20:42,411 --> 00:20:44,555
Yes, Chief Park.

208
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,921
Congressman Min just arrived.

209
00:21:32,073 --> 00:21:35,068
Excuse me... What can I bring you?

210
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:37,111
I'll have company in a minute.

211
00:21:50,107 --> 00:21:56,391
If you are listening to this tape,
it means you have betrayed us.

212
00:22:02,206 --> 00:22:04,442
Open the doors behind you,

213
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:06,544
and you'll find a briefcase.

214
00:22:06,776 --> 00:22:09,634
Open that briefcase.

215
00:22:25,122 --> 00:22:29,401
- Agreement -
I approve the constitutional amendment

216
00:22:29,522 --> 00:22:31,412
You didn't live up to our deal,

217
00:22:31,529 --> 00:22:37,825
so that hit list you were looking for
will now fall into Jo Pilyeon's hands.

218
00:22:40,809 --> 00:22:41,923
Chief Park!

219
00:22:42,048 --> 00:22:43,717
Park Hoyong!

220
00:22:46,467 --> 00:22:49,432
- What is the matter?
- Get your men and go capture Hwang Taeseop!

221
00:22:49,523 --> 00:22:50,675
Now!

222
00:22:50,907 --> 00:22:53,068
- Let's go.
- Yes.

223
00:22:54,991 --> 00:22:57,657
I'll be damned...

224
00:23:06,303 --> 00:23:08,199
Where has Hwang Taeseop gone?

225
00:23:08,323 --> 00:23:11,131
- And you are?
- Where is Hwang Taeseop?!

226
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,295
If you find out, tell us, will you?

227
00:23:13,434 --> 00:23:16,429
I knew his face so I did rent him this office,

228
00:23:16,582 --> 00:23:18,673
but he ran away without paying
the last three months' rent!

229
00:23:18,743 --> 00:23:22,381
Aigoo... See? Told you to get a deposit.

230
00:23:22,487 --> 00:23:24,563
Who imagined things
would turn out this way?

231
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:27,408
Still, he was a former
chairman so we trusted him...

232
00:23:27,514 --> 00:23:29,429
Look what that got us!

233
00:23:29,511 --> 00:23:31,719
Aigoo... Really...

234
00:23:31,802 --> 00:23:33,749
Find any removal centers in the area... Now!

235
00:23:33,847 --> 00:23:35,451
Yes.

236
00:23:36,132 --> 00:23:38,834
That fella must have done something wrong...

237
00:23:38,928 --> 00:23:41,396
Call us if you find him!

238
00:23:41,712 --> 00:23:43,521
They're gone.

239
00:23:46,199 --> 00:23:48,304
Yes, Chairman. It's me.

240
00:23:48,473 --> 00:23:51,671
Those people looking
for you just came here.

241
00:23:51,782 --> 00:23:56,080
Should anything happen, don't
hesitate and call me right away.

242
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:02,113
Gangmo, right as you said,
Min Honggi is on a rampage.

243
00:24:02,217 --> 00:24:04,236
This place is under
a manager's name,

244
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:05,751
so you'll be safe.

245
00:24:05,881 --> 00:24:09,081
How long must I keep staying here?

246
00:24:09,228 --> 00:24:12,153
We can't go on with this for long.

247
00:24:13,058 --> 00:24:14,963
Be careful out there.

248
00:24:15,189 --> 00:24:17,209
If they end up catching
you in this atmosphere,

249
00:24:17,338 --> 00:24:19,206
it might be fatal.

250
00:24:19,453 --> 00:24:21,717
Especially you, Jeongyeon.

251
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:24,069
Don't worry about me, Dad.

252
00:24:28,775 --> 00:24:33,062
It's tea they sent me from
Mount Jiri. Try it out.

253
00:24:38,278 --> 00:24:40,359
It has a nice scent.

254
00:24:45,739 --> 00:24:48,746
The flavor is delicate as well.

255
00:24:48,852 --> 00:24:51,221
I'm sure you're not
here to praise my tea.

256
00:24:51,377 --> 00:24:52,517
What do I owe this visit to?

257
00:24:52,622 --> 00:24:55,787
Nah... I was passing by so
I just thought I'd pay a visit.

258
00:24:55,916 --> 00:24:57,925
KCIA alumni can smell it a mile away.

259
00:24:58,052 --> 00:25:05,207
The fact that people only say that
when they have something to spy on.

260
00:25:06,241 --> 00:25:08,159
Even if that upsets you,
can't do anything about it.

261
00:25:08,271 --> 00:25:11,999
Since your attitude is
not to my liking either.

262
00:25:13,129 --> 00:25:17,955
Other than this fine tea, did you by
any chance receive anything else?

263
00:25:21,307 --> 00:25:24,232
Thanks for the tea. I'll get going.

264
00:25:24,866 --> 00:25:27,603
I looked into what those ruling
party members were talking about...

265
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:31,961
when gathering in secret like rats,

266
00:25:33,706 --> 00:25:35,609
and it turns out it was about the account.

267
00:25:35,853 --> 00:25:38,627
The one for the secret
presidential fund, that is.

268
00:25:44,136 --> 00:25:46,553
I did hear about that.

269
00:25:46,751 --> 00:25:50,172
But since nobody has actually seen it,

270
00:25:50,263 --> 00:25:51,802
wouldn't it just be a silly rumor?

271
00:25:51,948 --> 00:25:55,255
You're looking for that
account too, aren't you?

272
00:25:55,431 --> 00:25:58,594
If it does exist, I have to admit
I wouldn't mind finding it.

273
00:25:58,704 --> 00:26:02,382
Nah... You saw it firsthand.

274
00:26:02,525 --> 00:26:06,862
And that's the very reason why you're
trying to approach the opposition party.

275
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,946
Throw such nonsense at me again,

276
00:26:10,214 --> 00:26:11,883
and I won't let it slide.

277
00:26:11,996 --> 00:26:15,221
That account will end up in my hands.

278
00:26:15,373 --> 00:26:21,126
And after that happens,
I plan to deal with traitors first.

279
00:26:21,231 --> 00:26:24,832
Although by now I can more or less
figure out who they might be.

280
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:29,636
I don't know who will get that account,

281
00:26:29,746 --> 00:26:33,551
but I'm sure it'll spell
the end for someone else.

282
00:26:44,734 --> 00:26:49,324
Min Honggi can't already
be in possession of it, can he?

283
00:26:49,448 --> 00:26:52,122
Seeing how they
stopped those club gatherings,

284
00:26:52,273 --> 00:26:54,354
I'm sure that's not the case.

285
00:26:55,376 --> 00:26:57,077
And if he does have it,

286
00:26:57,187 --> 00:26:59,733
he's not the type to
just do nothing with it.

287
00:27:00,895 --> 00:27:02,763
You didn't live up to our deal,

288
00:27:02,947 --> 00:27:09,199
so that hit list you were looking for
will now fall into Jo Pilyeon's hands.

289
00:27:14,959 --> 00:27:17,045
- Agreement -
I approve the constitutional amendment

290
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:19,738
What are you going to do now?

291
00:27:21,312 --> 00:27:23,266
There are only two options on the table.

292
00:27:23,666 --> 00:27:25,440
Taking a step forward firsthand,

293
00:27:25,557 --> 00:27:30,274
or, as Seongmo suggested,
helping the two parties get together.

294
00:27:30,384 --> 00:27:33,028
It would be too dangerous
for us to take the initiative.

295
00:27:33,662 --> 00:27:37,264
And there's no guarantee
the opposition party will trust us.

296
00:27:38,004 --> 00:27:44,780
Still, since Min Honggi betrayed us, we can't
convince the ruling party members, either.

297
00:27:44,893 --> 00:27:47,598
To them, this is a hit list.

298
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:52,689
If we can't convince them,
we'll have to find another way.

299
00:27:52,942 --> 00:27:56,431
You're not telling me you want to...

300
00:28:01,047 --> 00:28:04,813
Here's a list of opposition party
members you must invite to the event.

301
00:28:10,698 --> 00:28:12,396
They're under strict surveillance.

302
00:28:12,503 --> 00:28:16,306
Not only they're bugged, but
even their mail is being controlled.

303
00:28:17,669 --> 00:28:19,243
Can you do that?

304
00:28:19,383 --> 00:28:21,087
I'll give it a try.

305
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:26,302
{\a6}"Direct Presidential Elections for a Democratic Future"

306
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:26,302
Your support could help
our democratization become reality.

307
00:28:38,868 --> 00:28:40,586
Hi.

308
00:28:45,607 --> 00:28:48,292
- Democratization Fund-raising Exhibition -

309
00:29:02,923 --> 00:29:05,688
- Jang Minjae, 1 million won -

310
00:29:08,459 --> 00:29:11,513
I guess you know
Congressman Jang well?!

311
00:29:12,887 --> 00:29:15,178
We meet here, of all places?!
I'm surprised.

312
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:17,400
I'm quite close with
opposition party members.

313
00:29:17,539 --> 00:29:19,677
And I help a few of them as well.

314
00:29:19,876 --> 00:29:21,108
I see...

315
00:29:21,249 --> 00:29:24,591
But what brings you here?

316
00:29:24,937 --> 00:29:27,728
An acquaintance from college
asked me to come here.

317
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:29,237
Is that so?

318
00:29:29,396 --> 00:29:33,224
And tell me, is business going well?

319
00:29:34,387 --> 00:29:36,421
Your credit institution, that is.

320
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:41,236
I hear you're hosting the upcoming
fund-raising event for the Olympics?

321
00:29:41,334 --> 00:29:42,766
I see you're well informed.

322
00:29:42,874 --> 00:29:45,745
You don't know how much I
blamed myself after hearing that.

323
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:50,738
We should have done that ourselves,
but I guess we were one step too late.

324
00:29:51,407 --> 00:29:54,743
Send my regards to Director Yoo.

325
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:03,116
That's Congressman Jang's wife.

326
00:30:04,893 --> 00:30:06,219
Have some cakes.

327
00:30:06,333 --> 00:30:08,192
Thank you.

328
00:30:10,412 --> 00:30:13,735
I never imagined Congressman
Jang had so much talent for this.

329
00:30:13,888 --> 00:30:16,484
This wasn't painted by the congressman,

330
00:30:16,613 --> 00:30:18,786
but by his deceased father.

331
00:30:19,244 --> 00:30:20,355
I see...

332
00:30:20,462 --> 00:30:23,649
It's the last trace of his father he had left...

333
00:30:25,693 --> 00:30:27,764
It must have been disheartening
to part with it.

334
00:30:27,891 --> 00:30:31,779
Still, could it compare with
his passion for democratization?

335
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,139
I will buy this painting.

336
00:30:36,314 --> 00:30:39,665
My... We set a really high price for this...

337
00:30:39,794 --> 00:30:41,587
It's for a good cause.

338
00:30:41,779 --> 00:30:44,240
- Secretary Choi.
- Yes, Director.

339
00:30:44,492 --> 00:30:46,818
We will buy it right away.

340
00:30:47,194 --> 00:30:48,777
Sure.

341
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,929
Here's my business card.

342
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,927
- 88 Seoul Olympics Support Committee -
Commissioner HWANG Jeongyeon

343
00:30:56,185 --> 00:30:59,263
I'll come pay my regards later.

344
00:31:08,525 --> 00:31:09,852
What's that?

345
00:31:09,965 --> 00:31:11,052
I don't know...

346
00:31:11,149 --> 00:31:13,600
Someone sent it to me.

347
00:31:15,597 --> 00:31:17,918
My... Why was this sent here?

348
00:31:18,034 --> 00:31:20,204
Didn't you say it was sold?

349
00:31:21,058 --> 00:31:24,480
I have the business card
of the lady who bought it.

350
00:31:26,864 --> 00:31:29,907
Hwang.... Jeong...yeon?!

351
00:31:30,893 --> 00:31:33,884
There's a message here.

352
00:31:36,539 --> 00:31:38,790
"Hang in there, Congressman Jang.

353
00:31:38,994 --> 00:31:42,670
Our people will always
support the pursuit of justice."

354
00:31:50,787 --> 00:31:52,314
Yes.

355
00:31:59,635 --> 00:32:01,503
I called you earlier on.

356
00:32:02,501 --> 00:32:04,093
Have a seat.

357
00:32:06,636 --> 00:32:10,203
I'm sure you brought
all the necessary paperwork?!

358
00:32:10,931 --> 00:32:15,254
I'd like to tell you something...

359
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:18,684
I don't need to discuss anything.

360
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:21,926
I just decide based on your collateral.

361
00:32:27,749 --> 00:32:29,383
What is this?

362
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:31,931
That is my collateral.

363
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:39,093
So you'll put no less than
seven-hundred million on the line?

364
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:42,651
I guess money is not what you're after?

365
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:46,916
I'd like to work under you, Sir.

366
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,453
Please, take me under your wings.

367
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:53,774
If it's for your sake, I'll do everything.

368
00:32:54,176 --> 00:32:57,332
With this much money, you
will make a pretty dignified living,

369
00:32:57,445 --> 00:32:58,605
so go find yourself another occupation.

370
00:32:58,722 --> 00:32:59,862
President.

371
00:33:00,218 --> 00:33:01,858
Look, youngster.

372
00:33:02,246 --> 00:33:04,424
I'm a man of great circumspection.

373
00:33:04,647 --> 00:33:07,771
Think I'd let a little money tempt me?

374
00:33:08,652 --> 00:33:11,528
If you want to work in the private lending
business, find yourself another firm.

375
00:33:11,652 --> 00:33:14,461
This is no place for a tenderfoot like you.

376
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:16,724
I'll be honest, then.

377
00:33:17,593 --> 00:33:21,633
I want to defeat Hwang Jeongyeon.

378
00:33:23,384 --> 00:33:25,557
Hwang Jeongyeon?!

379
00:33:26,532 --> 00:33:28,409
Yoo Gyeongok's daughter?

380
00:33:28,669 --> 00:33:30,190
Yes.

381
00:33:32,551 --> 00:33:34,195
Now that sounds a little more exciting...

382
00:33:34,305 --> 00:33:37,766
Why, did she dump you or something?

383
00:33:37,942 --> 00:33:39,646
Hwang Jeongyeon...

384
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,371
is my half-sister.

385
00:33:42,823 --> 00:33:46,618
Then, are you telling me that your father is...

386
00:33:46,935 --> 00:33:50,013
the founder of Manbo
Construction, Chairman Hwang Taeseop?

387
00:33:50,154 --> 00:33:51,786
That's right.

388
00:33:53,724 --> 00:33:55,287
Fascinating.

389
00:33:55,956 --> 00:34:01,016
I like the fact you're not a mere stranger.

390
00:34:01,768 --> 00:34:08,593
But can you tell me the reason why
you must defeat Hwang Jeongyeon?

391
00:34:09,633 --> 00:34:11,677
Because my mother's death...

392
00:34:12,545 --> 00:34:17,597
was caused by what Hwang
Jeongyeon and Yoo Gyeongok did to her.

393
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:23,556
I will mercilessly trample on them.

394
00:34:24,014 --> 00:34:27,397
I will force great misery upon them,

395
00:34:28,219 --> 00:34:33,129
and avenge my late mother.

396
00:34:34,797 --> 00:34:41,126
Revenge can be quite
the collateral, at times.

397
00:34:41,737 --> 00:34:43,672
Will you accept me?

398
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:45,754
Sit down, for starters.

399
00:34:48,209 --> 00:34:52,253
This is what Hwang
Jeongyeon is doing these days.

400
00:34:54,532 --> 00:34:57,563
Her intent is that of
establishing a credit institution.

401
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:02,393
And of course that is
something we don't exactly approve of.

402
00:35:03,298 --> 00:35:07,244
First, I leave Hwang Jeongyeon to you.

403
00:35:07,914 --> 00:35:10,545
Get in her way.

404
00:35:13,493 --> 00:35:15,571
Would you be up for the job?

405
00:35:18,167 --> 00:35:22,184
I will give it my very best.

406
00:35:26,002 --> 00:35:28,317
What? Cha Soojeong?

407
00:35:28,581 --> 00:35:30,836
And who would that be?

408
00:35:31,153 --> 00:35:32,774
A singer?

409
00:35:33,855 --> 00:35:36,674
We're almost there.
Will take a minute.

410
00:35:38,013 --> 00:35:39,751
What's the matter?

411
00:35:39,892 --> 00:35:43,672
This singer called Cha
Soojeong is asking to meet me.

412
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:48,406
If it's Cha Soojeong, I've heard
her on the radio a few times myself.

413
00:35:48,645 --> 00:35:50,250
Seems like she's becoming
really popular these days,

414
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,180
- should we ask her to sign...
- Just worry about driving.

415
00:35:53,586 --> 00:35:54,552
All right.

416
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:57,818
- Congressman JO Pilyeon -

417
00:36:01,353 --> 00:36:03,409
Miss Cha...

418
00:36:10,917 --> 00:36:13,360
So you were Cha Soojeong?

419
00:36:17,001 --> 00:36:20,114
Give this money to Minwoo.

420
00:36:21,788 --> 00:36:26,957
So you two were meeting behind my back.

421
00:36:27,458 --> 00:36:29,106
I told you to live as
if you were dead,

422
00:36:29,236 --> 00:36:31,350
and you become a singer
and pester me instead?

423
00:36:31,867 --> 00:36:33,840
I see you haven't changed.

424
00:36:34,822 --> 00:36:36,890
The reason I'm giving
you this money instead...

425
00:36:37,019 --> 00:36:42,598
is to make sure Minwoo never
shows up before me again.

426
00:36:45,124 --> 00:36:50,182
I suggest you quit your
singing career and move abroad.

427
00:36:54,987 --> 00:36:56,643
Don't delude yourself.

428
00:36:56,784 --> 00:37:01,612
Since I didn't leave Minwoo
because I was afraid of you.

429
00:37:01,788 --> 00:37:02,605
What?

430
00:37:02,708 --> 00:37:04,607
And you know why...

431
00:37:05,653 --> 00:37:08,390
I never told Minwoo
about what you did to me?

432
00:37:08,641 --> 00:37:11,694
Because being disappointed by your
own family would be too much to endure,

433
00:37:11,824 --> 00:37:16,930
since you are the only
people Minwoo can rely on.

434
00:37:17,999 --> 00:37:19,444
If you consider yourself a father...

435
00:37:19,561 --> 00:37:22,146
If you for a single minute could consider that,

436
00:37:22,416 --> 00:37:24,941
then wake up and look at how much
suffering your son is going through.

437
00:37:25,023 --> 00:37:28,544
- Shut that insolent little mouth of yours!
- Watch your language.

438
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:32,126
Don't force me to seek revenge.

439
00:37:32,255 --> 00:37:33,759
Revenge?!

440
00:37:34,088 --> 00:37:37,497
And you little tramp
would get revenge against me?

441
00:37:38,775 --> 00:37:42,296
Coming here was a grave mistake.

442
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:46,666
Since you'll soon find out
how scary and cruel life can get.

443
00:37:46,846 --> 00:37:49,438
- Get her out of my face.
- All right.

444
00:37:55,374 --> 00:37:56,913
Yes.

445
00:37:57,266 --> 00:37:59,204
Ohh... Chief Oh.

446
00:37:59,709 --> 00:38:02,411
No, go ahead.
Tell me.

447
00:38:03,526 --> 00:38:05,053
Let's go.

448
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:09,524
I told you I couldn't care less
whether Lee Seongmo dies or not!

449
00:38:11,345 --> 00:38:13,236
People don't die so easily.

450
00:38:13,331 --> 00:38:17,371
A little torture
won't kill someone like him.

451
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:22,991
If you insist,
just take a step back.

452
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,527
I said if anyone sets
him free, I'll be the one!

453
00:38:25,623 --> 00:38:27,419
Is that clear?

454
00:38:29,886 --> 00:38:32,166
Those fools...

455
00:38:35,631 --> 00:38:37,734
Lee Seongmo.

456
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:39,884
I'm sure the number is right.

457
00:38:39,974 --> 00:38:41,817
He's a chief there.

458
00:38:41,907 --> 00:38:44,570
I'm sorry, there
is no such person here.

459
00:38:44,921 --> 00:38:45,918
Hello?

460
00:38:46,014 --> 00:38:47,789
Hello?

461
00:38:56,328 --> 00:38:58,431
Big Oppa...

462
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:01,341
What on earth happened to you?

463
00:39:01,563 --> 00:39:04,031
Seongmo Oppa...

464
00:39:12,667 --> 00:39:15,909
So you're going to invite
Cha Soojeong to the event?

465
00:39:16,086 --> 00:39:20,206
Why... Are you a fan, too?

466
00:39:20,596 --> 00:39:21,959
That's surprising?!

467
00:39:22,123 --> 00:39:24,716
You even have a favorite singer...

468
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:26,726
Cha Soojeong...

469
00:39:27,701 --> 00:39:31,630
is the younger sister
I lost in my childhood.

470
00:39:31,847 --> 00:39:33,069
What?

471
00:39:35,876 --> 00:39:40,274
Then... That kiddo from
back then is Cha Soojeong?!

472
00:39:43,575 --> 00:39:45,972
Yes, I'm Lee Gangmo of
Hangang Construction.

473
00:39:46,394 --> 00:39:48,026
Little Oppa...

474
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,012
Ohh, Miju.

475
00:39:51,516 --> 00:39:53,671
What's wrong with your voice?

476
00:39:54,352 --> 00:39:58,710
Oppa... Can we meet?

477
00:39:59,285 --> 00:40:01,012
Where are you now?

478
00:40:02,281 --> 00:40:03,106
All right.

479
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:05,257
Will be there in a moment.

480
00:40:10,331 --> 00:40:13,115
Sorry, Jeongyeon.
I'll have to go.

481
00:40:18,173 --> 00:40:20,193
Miju?!

482
00:40:36,926 --> 00:40:38,453
Miju...

483
00:40:39,416 --> 00:40:41,037
Is anything wrong?

484
00:40:41,624 --> 00:40:44,914
Where is Seongmo now?

485
00:40:48,708 --> 00:40:51,574
I guess something urgent
came up in the provinces.

486
00:40:52,502 --> 00:40:54,687
I've heard he might die!

487
00:40:54,757 --> 00:40:56,991
He's being tortured!

488
00:40:58,636 --> 00:41:00,207
You knew it, right?

489
00:41:00,306 --> 00:41:02,113
Where is Seongmo now?

490
00:41:02,183 --> 00:41:05,341
Uh? What is happening to him?

491
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,434
Miju.

492
00:41:08,291 --> 00:41:09,583
Listen well.

493
00:41:09,677 --> 00:41:11,835
Seongmo Oppa...

494
00:41:14,278 --> 00:41:16,245
Get a hold of yourself and listen to me.

495
00:41:16,358 --> 00:41:18,026
Lee Miju!

496
00:41:20,058 --> 00:41:23,773
I will rescue him.

497
00:41:24,325 --> 00:41:26,287
That is what I'm doing now.

498
00:41:26,664 --> 00:41:29,024
So don't you worry, Miju.

499
00:41:29,353 --> 00:41:33,394
Just believe in me.

500
00:41:33,805 --> 00:41:34,662
Got it?

501
00:41:34,791 --> 00:41:36,843
What should I do?

502
00:41:36,972 --> 00:41:41,154
He's in danger, what can I do?

503
00:41:47,262 --> 00:41:54,699
Just... Don't worry about a thing,
and just stay by my side.

504
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:58,493
Thinking about you
is helping him as well.

505
00:41:58,669 --> 00:42:00,976
Seongmo Oppa...

506
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:11,348
But how did you find out?

507
00:42:13,355 --> 00:42:16,232
Who told you about him?

508
00:42:16,726 --> 00:42:19,322
I went to meet Minwoo's father,

509
00:42:19,455 --> 00:42:21,156
and I heard him talking about it.

510
00:42:21,265 --> 00:42:23,527
You met Jo Pilyeon?

511
00:42:25,183 --> 00:42:27,545
Is Jo Minwoo bothering you again?

512
00:42:27,819 --> 00:42:29,777
It's all over.

513
00:42:30,063 --> 00:42:32,714
You don't need to worry, Oppa.

514
00:43:04,355 --> 00:43:05,912
Yes...

515
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:08,392
Yes, Sir!

516
00:43:08,956 --> 00:43:10,671
All right, Sir.

517
00:43:11,188 --> 00:43:13,107
I will do that.

518
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:14,430
Seongmo...

519
00:43:14,509 --> 00:43:15,429
Seongmo!

520
00:43:15,537 --> 00:43:17,120
Seongmo!

521
00:43:19,482 --> 00:43:21,608
I just answered...

522
00:43:23,241 --> 00:43:25,601
Who is behind all this?

523
00:43:25,697 --> 00:43:28,471
I just followed my superior's orders...

524
00:43:31,335 --> 00:43:34,460
Seongmo, are you all right?

525
00:43:35,505 --> 00:43:36,809
Help him out of here.

526
00:43:36,915 --> 00:43:38,162
All right.

527
00:43:38,454 --> 00:43:40,356
Seongmo, let's go.

528
00:43:52,119 --> 00:43:54,588
Careful...

529
00:43:58,054 --> 00:44:00,171
If I knew they'd take you there,

530
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,306
I would have acted a lot earlier.

531
00:44:02,412 --> 00:44:04,197
Forgive me, Seongmo.

532
00:44:04,739 --> 00:44:06,546
It's nothing.

533
00:44:07,122 --> 00:44:10,028
Did you find the account?

534
00:44:10,125 --> 00:44:14,798
Your allegations haven't
been cleared yet.

535
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:21,469
So until the account shows up,
you'll have to remain confined here.

536
00:44:21,716 --> 00:44:23,662
I see.

537
00:44:25,624 --> 00:44:27,048
Seongmo.

538
00:44:27,292 --> 00:44:32,038
As a condition for setting you free,
I promised it to the ANSP director.

539
00:44:32,355 --> 00:44:36,869
That I would find the account in a week.

540
00:44:37,375 --> 00:44:41,885
Just send me back there.

541
00:44:42,731 --> 00:44:47,829
I don't want you to
face dishonor because of me.

542
00:44:48,498 --> 00:44:50,325
Let me handle this.

543
00:44:50,538 --> 00:44:55,119
Just focus on recovering
and don't worry about it.

544
00:45:05,863 --> 00:45:07,249
Keep him in check,

545
00:45:07,472 --> 00:45:09,680
and there is no need to purposely stop
any contacts with the outside.

546
00:45:09,821 --> 00:45:11,896
Just keep track of everything he does.

547
00:45:12,041 --> 00:45:13,921
Yes, all right.

548
00:45:38,794 --> 00:45:40,803
Gangmo...

549
00:45:41,707 --> 00:45:43,674
Miju...

550
00:45:49,042 --> 00:45:51,099
Are you out of your mind?

551
00:45:51,321 --> 00:45:52,757
Soojeong is a singer!

552
00:45:52,862 --> 00:45:54,706
How can you let her go by herself!

553
00:45:54,794 --> 00:45:57,199
D... Director, I'm really sorry.

554
00:45:57,309 --> 00:45:59,140
Send everyone out to find her.

555
00:45:59,246 --> 00:45:59,857
Now!

556
00:45:59,951 --> 00:46:01,432
Yes!

557
00:46:03,122 --> 00:46:04,250
Miju!

558
00:46:04,657 --> 00:46:07,409
Where have you been?

559
00:46:13,253 --> 00:46:14,698
What have you been doing all this time?

560
00:46:14,921 --> 00:46:16,730
I apologize.

561
00:46:17,224 --> 00:46:19,937
I had something to take care of.

562
00:46:20,606 --> 00:46:22,545
Did you cry?

563
00:46:26,938 --> 00:46:28,818
Let's talk about that later.

564
00:46:29,452 --> 00:46:31,672
We need to go somewhere together.

565
00:46:33,199 --> 00:46:37,016
The fund-raising event
for the Seoul Olympics?!

566
00:46:37,110 --> 00:46:39,570
Did Miju really get invited there?

567
00:46:39,684 --> 00:46:42,748
A who's who of the financial
and political world will be there.

568
00:46:42,971 --> 00:46:46,037
Not to mention the attention
it will get from the press.

569
00:46:47,693 --> 00:46:51,527
You must become the star of the night.

570
00:46:51,708 --> 00:46:53,372
Is that clear?

571
00:46:54,065 --> 00:46:58,904
You must be the queen of
that fund-raising event.

572
00:46:59,503 --> 00:47:01,772
Cha Soojeong!
You really hit the jackpot.

573
00:47:01,876 --> 00:47:04,872
How can they give such an
opportunity to a newcomer like you?

574
00:47:07,970 --> 00:47:11,177
But, where are we going now?

575
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,785
We'll meet with the organizers.

576
00:47:20,084 --> 00:47:22,117
That's impressive.

577
00:47:22,351 --> 00:47:26,167
So you planned all this?

578
00:47:26,391 --> 00:47:28,668
You will come as well, right?

579
00:47:28,791 --> 00:47:31,317
You put my name right on top...

580
00:47:31,429 --> 00:47:33,608
How could I not participate?!

581
00:47:33,954 --> 00:47:35,058
Thank you.

582
00:47:35,184 --> 00:47:38,700
Make sure all the other
congressmen join us as well.

583
00:47:39,052 --> 00:47:43,981
But... These opposition party
members are the issue,

584
00:47:44,228 --> 00:47:46,932
considering the ruling
party members involved.

585
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,926
I thought that it would make
this event a lot more meaningful that way.

586
00:47:49,008 --> 00:47:50,712
What Jeongyeon says is right.

587
00:47:50,794 --> 00:47:54,081
It's right at a time like this
that the two parties should gather,

588
00:47:54,201 --> 00:47:55,475
or else when would they ever meet?

589
00:47:55,546 --> 00:47:58,541
That was my intent as well.

590
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:04,262
But who is this singer
you invited, Cha Soojeong?

591
00:48:10,155 --> 00:48:11,797
You've come, Congressman Oh.

592
00:48:11,987 --> 00:48:12,968
Director Yoo.

593
00:48:13,074 --> 00:48:14,561
But, who is this lady?

594
00:48:14,795 --> 00:48:16,803
That's quite a beauty.

595
00:48:16,915 --> 00:48:18,430
Introduce yourself.

596
00:48:19,482 --> 00:48:21,520
How are you?
My name is Cha Soojeong.

597
00:48:21,661 --> 00:48:23,071
Cha Soojeong?

598
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:27,475
Then, that singer who
was invited to this event?

599
00:48:27,581 --> 00:48:31,222
Here's this event's
host, Director Hwang Jeongyeon.

600
00:48:31,387 --> 00:48:32,855
Nice to meet you.

601
00:48:33,008 --> 00:48:33,995
It's a pleasure.

602
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:37,788
And here's Deputy
Mayor Han Myeongseok.

603
00:48:38,001 --> 00:48:39,492
How are you?

604
00:48:39,727 --> 00:48:41,171
Ahh... Yes...

605
00:48:41,295 --> 00:48:45,714
You really should
be thankful to the deputy.

606
00:48:46,105 --> 00:48:47,223
What?

607
00:48:47,459 --> 00:48:53,109
He was behind all
your recent TV and radio gigs.

608
00:48:57,291 --> 00:48:58,336
What is this?

609
00:48:58,477 --> 00:49:01,462
Was there such a side to you?

610
00:49:04,023 --> 00:49:06,442
Excuse me...

611
00:49:12,327 --> 00:49:15,260
We've known each other for thirty years.

612
00:49:15,367 --> 00:49:19,246
But I've never seem him like this?!

613
00:49:27,826 --> 00:49:29,314
Aren't you going in?

614
00:49:29,482 --> 00:49:33,770
Ahh... Yes... Something
urgent suddenly came up.

615
00:49:34,768 --> 00:49:35,673
Were you looking for me, Deputy?

616
00:49:35,755 --> 00:49:40,358
Right... Drive the
congressman home, will you?

617
00:49:40,470 --> 00:49:42,975
I'll grab a taxi.

618
00:49:44,279 --> 00:49:45,195
Deputy...

619
00:49:45,336 --> 00:49:46,274
Deputy!

620
00:49:46,379 --> 00:49:50,457
By any chance, is Cha Soojeong here?

621
00:49:51,996 --> 00:49:54,309
Is that the reason
he's acting like that?

622
00:49:55,026 --> 00:49:57,915
He's always so fierce no matter what,

623
00:49:58,162 --> 00:50:01,004
but strangely, it all suddenly
changes whenever he sees her.

624
00:50:01,850 --> 00:50:06,298
By any chance, the man who always
sent flowers after every concert...

625
00:50:06,427 --> 00:50:07,390
That's right.

626
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,199
The deputy sent them.

627
00:50:15,378 --> 00:50:20,167
I haven't had so
much fun in a long time.

628
00:50:20,312 --> 00:50:21,388
Miss Soojeong.

629
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:25,176
You're more fun to hang out
with than I could possibly imagine.

630
00:50:25,284 --> 00:50:27,343
Be careful, Congressman.

631
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:30,146
Thank you, Soojeong.

632
00:50:37,894 --> 00:50:42,393
I've never seen him
in such a jovial mood before.

633
00:50:43,638 --> 00:50:46,193
Shall we have a drink together?

634
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:47,896
What?

635
00:50:52,958 --> 00:50:55,249
Yes.
Let's do that.

636
00:50:57,833 --> 00:50:59,554
Can you handle drinks?

637
00:50:59,707 --> 00:51:01,551
A little.

638
00:51:05,052 --> 00:51:08,874
I know you well.

639
00:51:09,398 --> 00:51:11,254
Know me how...

640
00:51:11,418 --> 00:51:13,850
So you're Gangmo's sister?

641
00:51:14,148 --> 00:51:16,298
You know him?

642
00:51:16,427 --> 00:51:19,026
We even met before.

643
00:51:19,199 --> 00:51:22,652
Although you were so little back
then, I doubt you'd remember.

644
00:51:22,828 --> 00:51:24,397
When was that?

645
00:51:26,402 --> 00:51:30,619
Then, should we eat just one?

646
00:51:39,204 --> 00:51:42,716
Go ahead and eat.
They're still warm.

647
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:47,285
It's all right.
Go ahead.

648
00:51:50,563 --> 00:51:51,834
Aren't you going to?

649
00:51:51,993 --> 00:51:56,128
Yeah... I'll wait for Mommy.

650
00:52:00,662 --> 00:52:02,800
Must feel great.

651
00:52:03,011 --> 00:52:04,360
What?

652
00:52:05,077 --> 00:52:06,956
Having your mother by your side.

653
00:52:07,050 --> 00:52:09,811
Why, don't you have a mother?

654
00:52:12,594 --> 00:52:14,227
I remember!

655
00:52:14,427 --> 00:52:17,094
How is this possible?!

656
00:52:17,232 --> 00:52:20,117
I'm so glad you remember.

657
00:52:20,766 --> 00:52:24,766
So did you find your mother?
You were looking for her back then...

658
00:52:26,675 --> 00:52:29,586
I'm sorry.
I'm so tactless...

659
00:52:29,905 --> 00:52:31,139
It's okay.

660
00:52:31,304 --> 00:52:33,101
Just call me by name, Eonni.

661
00:52:33,582 --> 00:52:37,130
You're friends with Gangmo,
of course you should.

662
00:52:37,799 --> 00:52:39,257
Should I?

663
00:52:39,455 --> 00:52:41,100
All right, Soojeong.

664
00:52:41,452 --> 00:52:43,567
How about a toast?

665
00:52:50,792 --> 00:52:54,891
But, wasn't your name Lee Miju?

666
00:52:55,021 --> 00:52:56,066
That's right.

667
00:52:56,207 --> 00:52:58,103
You even remember that?

668
00:52:58,346 --> 00:53:02,129
I've heard your call earlier today.

669
00:53:03,714 --> 00:53:06,757
My brother Seongmo is in danger.

670
00:53:06,874 --> 00:53:10,177
Gangmo and I are planning something.

671
00:53:10,549 --> 00:53:11,759
It will all go well.

672
00:53:11,865 --> 00:53:14,097
Is there anything I can do to help you?

673
00:53:15,342 --> 00:53:17,221
Even you are helping us...

674
00:53:17,374 --> 00:53:20,451
I'm his sister and there is
nothing I have done to help...

675
00:53:21,332 --> 00:53:24,875
Maybe you can do something after all.

676
00:53:24,998 --> 00:53:26,248
What is it?

677
00:53:26,424 --> 00:53:30,359
If we could only rescue him,
I would do anything.

678
00:53:35,222 --> 00:53:37,559
Come eat at home a
little more often, will you?

679
00:53:37,682 --> 00:53:40,620
See how nice it is to eat all together?

680
00:53:42,699 --> 00:53:45,483
So you're opening a boiler factory?

681
00:53:45,847 --> 00:53:47,938
We will begin the
construction very soon.

682
00:53:51,427 --> 00:53:53,400
What is this?

683
00:53:57,629 --> 00:53:59,850
It's... money?!

684
00:53:59,944 --> 00:54:01,740
It's Minwoo's.

685
00:54:04,983 --> 00:54:06,869
What is that money for?

686
00:54:07,731 --> 00:54:10,844
A certain Cha Soojeong handed it to me.

687
00:54:11,737 --> 00:54:14,521
Who is Cha Soojeong?

688
00:54:16,334 --> 00:54:17,196
And what did you tell her?

689
00:54:17,325 --> 00:54:19,272
She seems full of resentment.

690
00:54:19,382 --> 00:54:21,338
Felt like she was treating
you like a bug to stomp on.

691
00:54:21,491 --> 00:54:23,758
I asked you what you told her.

692
00:54:24,909 --> 00:54:26,671
She's already forgotten you.

693
00:54:26,859 --> 00:54:29,765
- You're the problem.
- You're responsible for that!

694
00:54:29,859 --> 00:54:31,175
Hey... Minwoo!

695
00:54:31,257 --> 00:54:33,238
You're the one who forced that on Miju.

696
00:54:33,343 --> 00:54:35,175
I can't stand the
fact she became a singer.

697
00:54:35,310 --> 00:54:38,199
Since you'd get to see her
every time she shows up on TV.

698
00:54:38,281 --> 00:54:39,274
Dad...

699
00:54:39,350 --> 00:54:42,802
Better to deal with the problem
at the root from the very beginning.

700
00:54:42,931 --> 00:54:46,044
You won't see her on TV from now on.

701
00:54:46,361 --> 00:54:48,987
You just try to bother Miju again.

702
00:54:49,251 --> 00:54:51,929
I'll cut my ties with you once and for all.

703
00:54:53,573 --> 00:54:55,619
H... Hey.... Minwoo!

704
00:54:55,890 --> 00:54:58,134
Minwoo!

705
00:54:58,627 --> 00:55:01,818
The son can never cut such ties.

706
00:55:01,927 --> 00:55:05,525
It's up to the father to abandon his child.

707
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:30,096
Are all the preparations complete?

708
00:55:30,237 --> 00:55:31,928
It already started.

709
00:55:32,138 --> 00:55:33,792
What is your plan?

710
00:55:34,019 --> 00:55:38,936
Our goal is to gather three
members from each party,

711
00:55:39,124 --> 00:55:42,495
and make them form a six-man committee
supporting the constitutional amendment.

712
00:55:43,470 --> 00:55:49,123
And how are you going to convince
all those ruling party members?

713
00:55:53,539 --> 00:55:56,065
This was sent to you, Congressman.

714
00:56:02,905 --> 00:56:05,299
- Agreement -
I approve the constitutional amendment

715
00:56:05,388 --> 00:56:06,863
- Park Hongseok -

716
00:56:17,431 --> 00:56:19,107
Hello?

717
00:56:19,298 --> 00:56:22,916
Have you received what I sent you?

718
00:56:23,363 --> 00:56:25,216
Who are you?

719
00:56:25,344 --> 00:56:27,835
A citizen who wants a democratic Korea.

720
00:56:29,151 --> 00:56:31,806
I will soon give you further instructions.

721
00:56:32,228 --> 00:56:35,541
Unless you want the
Blue House to get the original,

722
00:56:36,069 --> 00:56:38,912
I suggest you don't go back on
your word regarding the amendment.

723
00:56:39,018 --> 00:56:41,505
Look... Listen to me!

724
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:49,818
Yes?

725
00:57:00,086 --> 00:57:02,682
Just answer my question,
Congressman Kang.

726
00:57:03,199 --> 00:57:07,416
Who do you think you
owe that golden badge to?

727
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:09,762
Of... Of course...

728
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:13,450
to our people.

729
00:57:13,544 --> 00:57:19,628
Then, do you by any chance know what
our people most wish for right now?

730
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,303
Answer.

731
00:57:26,051 --> 00:57:29,954
Are you referring to
direct presidential elections?

732
00:57:30,268 --> 00:57:34,245
I see you knew.

733
00:58:24,787 --> 00:58:29,900
So you're taking them along
the ride whether they like it or not.

734
00:58:31,204 --> 00:58:35,393
It is all thanks to the
agreement you made them sign.

735
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:38,087
That's for the ruling party,

736
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:41,752
but how will you deal
with the opposition members?

737
00:58:44,359 --> 00:58:46,779
With the kind of
surveillance they're dealing with,

738
00:58:47,061 --> 00:58:49,986
even approaching
them won't be easy...

739
00:58:53,533 --> 00:58:55,537
Honey.

740
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:57,170
Let me introduce her.

741
00:58:57,295 --> 00:58:58,794
She's Director Hwang Jeongyeon.

742
00:58:58,888 --> 00:59:02,482
- Ahh... The one who sent us the painting...
- It's a true honor to finally meet you,

743
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:03,535
Congressman Jang.

744
00:59:03,644 --> 00:59:05,021
An honor?!

745
00:59:05,138 --> 00:59:09,300
I'm facing so much pressure these days.

746
00:59:11,203 --> 00:59:13,811
- Congressman Choi Hakgil, if I'm not mistaken?
- Yes... That's right.

747
00:59:13,917 --> 00:59:16,595
- And Congressman Oh Sucheol.
- Yes, nice to meet you.

748
00:59:16,747 --> 00:59:19,390
After only seeing you on TV
or newspapers, I finally get to meet you.

749
00:59:19,519 --> 00:59:22,631
I guess sometimes getting
arrested has its positives after all.

750
00:59:22,754 --> 00:59:26,256
I even get to meet
people who recognize me...

751
00:59:41,166 --> 00:59:44,032
Since she's been
proclaimed host of the event,

752
00:59:44,196 --> 00:59:46,450
that's going to greatly
help her approach them.

753
00:59:46,568 --> 00:59:48,917
Jeongyeon is doing great.

754
00:59:52,594 --> 00:59:54,367
I see.

755
00:59:55,225 --> 00:59:58,809
So how are you going
to rescue your brother?

756
00:59:58,946 --> 01:00:00,732
If things go according to plan,

757
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:04,808
he'll be released
after Jeongyeon's event.

758
01:00:06,593 --> 01:00:12,698
Fishing here has made
me lose track of time.

759
01:00:14,448 --> 01:00:19,288
Now it's time for you
to take a step forward.

760
01:00:21,966 --> 01:00:29,758
- Student Demonstration in
Support of Direct Presidential Elections -

761
01:00:37,277 --> 01:00:41,007
Hey... Aren't you guys hungry?

762
01:00:41,210 --> 01:00:44,315
Should we order some chicken?

763
01:00:45,737 --> 01:00:47,558
I'm fine.

764
01:00:47,734 --> 01:00:50,213
I'll give you the
money, so go get some.

765
01:00:50,307 --> 01:00:53,081
Where did I put my wallet...

766
01:01:26,575 --> 01:01:28,812
What's going on?

767
01:01:29,841 --> 01:01:31,118
Seonbaenim!

768
01:01:31,365 --> 01:01:33,515
Open the door!

769
01:01:58,459 --> 01:01:59,173
Chairman.

770
01:01:59,294 --> 01:02:03,392
The PI sent us all his data
regarding Cha Soojeong.

771
01:02:29,587 --> 01:02:33,487
Isn't that President Lee Gangmo?

772
01:02:34,490 --> 01:02:37,050

If we want to use Min Honggi,
he needs a let-out.

778
01:03:00,057 --> 01:03:02,616
Didn't you have a copy of it?

779
01:03:02,710 --> 01:03:04,861
Are you telling me you didn't make one?

780
01:03:04,968 --> 01:03:05,922
Is that true?

781
01:03:06,042 --> 01:03:08,419
Opposition party members said so themselves.

782
01:03:08,536 --> 01:03:09,699
It's legit.

783
01:03:09,805 --> 01:03:13,130
So you get an apartment from Lee Gangmo,
gigs on TV from Han Myeongseok...

784
01:03:13,236 --> 01:03:15,755
Must you really do this to me...

785
01:03:16,123 --> 01:03:18,168
Get out, Lee Gangmo!

786
01:03:18,883 --> 01:03:22,001
If you are the culprit,
I suggest you pull that trigger.

787
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:23,406
What people call suspicion...

788
01:03:23,517 --> 01:03:25,449
You either let go of it once and for all,

789
01:03:25,532 --> 01:03:28,054
or keep suspecting to the very end.
