- Episode 32 -

4
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:10,427
You were one step 
too late, Lee Gangmo.

5
00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:32,220
Jeongyeon asked me to stop you
from obtaining that construction permit.

6
00:00:32,981 --> 00:00:36,555
Get on your knees and 
start begging me to save you.

7
00:00:36,695 --> 00:00:40,005
Then, I might even be
inclined to vouch for you.

8
00:00:41,434 --> 00:00:46,051
Let's just say you'll exchange your
pride for Hangang Construction's future.

9
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:49,455
<i>How about it?
Isn't it worth a second thought?</i>

10
00:00:49,965 --> 00:00:54,160
You never know 
when I might change my mind.

11
00:00:54,641 --> 00:00:56,376
Anyone running a business should
be aware that chances like this...

12
00:00:56,449 --> 00:00:59,453
<i>don't come knocking 
on your door too often.</i>

13
00:00:59,949 --> 00:01:02,661
So hurry up and get on your knees.

14
00:01:02,924 --> 00:01:05,662
Beg me to save you.

15
00:01:41,552 --> 00:01:44,125
Since we're here,
I'll let you in on something.

16
00:01:46,656 --> 00:01:52,985
You will one day 
be forced to kneel before me...

17
00:01:54,501 --> 00:01:56,606
and beg for mercy.

18
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,972
Fine.

19
00:02:00,191 --> 00:02:06,170
We'll see how long that
arrogance of yours can last.

20
00:02:32,259 --> 00:02:36,760
If he had gotten on his knees, 
would you have given him your approval?

21
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:41,444
It was already all said and done 
before he even got here.

22
00:02:42,628 --> 00:02:47,263
Hangang Construction will be
assigned the Gaepo apartment project.

23
00:02:47,869 --> 00:02:50,644
So are you saying that you had
already given him your approval?

24
00:02:51,238 --> 00:02:55,087
Back in the can, I had the chance
to read a few history books.

25
00:02:55,233 --> 00:02:57,304
<i>{\a6}*Yiyi Zhiyi: From San Guo Zhi, "Fight off the 
barbarians (enemies) using other barbarians"</i>

26
00:02:55,233 --> 00:02:57,304
Heard of that maxim, Yiyi Jeyi*?

27
00:02:57,421 --> 00:03:01,413
Meaning that you'll use Hangang Construction
to fight off Manbo Construction?

28
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:05,477
We'll use Lee Gangmo to drive
Hwang Jeongyeon out of the picture.

29
00:03:06,148 --> 00:03:07,445
And in the meantime,

30
00:03:07,591 --> 00:03:11,426
Minwoo will use that opportunity
to gain control of the company.

31
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:15,983
That's how the tide is
turned in power struggles.

32
00:03:16,151 --> 00:03:18,528
You're really brilliant.

33
00:03:18,729 --> 00:03:21,284
Everything has its due course.

34
00:03:21,631 --> 00:03:23,778
Hangang Construction is still 
nothing but a blip on our radar.

35
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:26,096
Once Minwoo gets his hands 
on Manbo Construction,

36
00:03:26,235 --> 00:03:29,173
we can always send them
back where they came from.

37
00:03:38,561 --> 00:03:40,850
Yiyi Jeyi...

38
00:03:41,273 --> 00:03:45,311
Jo Minwoo striking
Hwang Jeongyeon would work, too.

39
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:48,579
And then, Jo Pilyeon,

40
00:03:48,886 --> 00:03:51,190
your turn will come.

41
00:03:55,579 --> 00:03:58,014
This could come back 
to haunt us anytime.

42
00:03:58,225 --> 00:04:00,843
We can't allow things 
to stay as they are.

43
00:04:04,066 --> 00:04:07,429
Mom...
Again with that bottle?

44
00:04:07,684 --> 00:04:11,436
Did you look into 
the Royal Club's owner?

45
00:04:11,592 --> 00:04:14,374
I hired some private 
investigators to dig into her.

46
00:04:14,478 --> 00:04:15,872
So what is she all about?

47
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:17,805
What's her relationship with your father?

48
00:04:17,907 --> 00:04:20,878
You really...
That temper of yours.

49
00:04:23,188 --> 00:04:25,711
Couldn't find that much about her past.

50
00:04:25,944 --> 00:04:28,175
By any chance, ever heard of Baekpa?

51
00:04:28,271 --> 00:04:29,627
Baekpa?

52
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:31,997
From Myeongdong's 
private-lending market?

53
00:04:32,288 --> 00:04:33,813
Yeah.

54
00:04:34,606 --> 00:04:38,164
She's that old man's adopted daughter.

55
00:04:38,675 --> 00:04:40,215
What?

56
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:42,497
She's Baekpa's adopted daughter?!

57
00:04:42,591 --> 00:04:43,481
Yeah.

58
00:04:43,627 --> 00:04:46,616
Looks like if her old man goes,
she might inherit his business.

59
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:50,982
So bank directors and company CEOs 
are all groveling at her feet.

60
00:04:51,895 --> 00:04:54,229
Looks like you barked up the wrong tree.

61
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:57,494
You never know when I might need her help, 
once I inherit the company.

62
00:04:57,581 --> 00:04:59,737
<i>Ahh... Enough, shut your mouth.</i>

63
00:05:00,072 --> 00:05:01,691
That's that.

64
00:05:02,026 --> 00:05:04,930
Go get some men.

65
00:05:05,089 --> 00:05:05,874
For what?

66
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:09,581
So we can get your father 
out of there tonight.

67
00:05:10,149 --> 00:05:11,670
Uh?!

68
00:05:18,023 --> 00:05:20,454
What is this?

69
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,321
Where are you trying
to take the chairman?

70
00:05:23,419 --> 00:05:25,162
<i>Are you abducting him?</i>

71
00:05:25,398 --> 00:05:26,785
Will you shut that trap?

72
00:05:26,863 --> 00:05:27,950
Ma'am!

73
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:29,569
I said keep your mouth shut.

74
00:05:29,671 --> 00:05:30,719
There's no time!

75
00:05:30,838 --> 00:05:31,654
Hurry up and take him out!

76
00:05:31,742 --> 00:05:34,367
- Yes!
- What are you doing?

77
00:05:34,512 --> 00:05:37,312
<i>Chairman! Chairman!</i>

78
00:05:46,219 --> 00:05:48,917
Where are you taking that patient?

79
00:05:49,106 --> 00:05:50,138
To another hospital.

80
00:05:50,302 --> 00:05:51,279
Which one?

81
00:05:51,469 --> 00:05:52,796
None of your business.

82
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,391
<i>What are you waiting for? Let's go.</i>

83
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:00,928
Here's your soup.

84
00:06:05,045 --> 00:06:08,457
So what on earth is wrong with Minwoo?

85
00:06:08,676 --> 00:06:10,726
Who said anything is wrong?

86
00:06:11,067 --> 00:06:16,069
He just said he's busy at work,
so he wanted to go live a little closer.

87
00:06:17,498 --> 00:06:18,219
Honey.

88
00:06:18,321 --> 00:06:20,040
Just close an eye.

89
00:06:20,216 --> 00:06:22,648
It's about time he moved out.

90
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:25,264
He's got a woman, all right.

91
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,360
What?

92
00:06:27,843 --> 00:06:29,914
What kind of woman is she?

93
00:06:30,555 --> 00:06:33,953
I suggest you tell me 
before I have to find out by myself.

94
00:06:34,047 --> 00:06:39,818
Ahh... Of all the 
women he could choose...

95
00:06:39,928 --> 00:06:43,925
Honey, I'll deal with
them personally, so...

96
00:06:44,523 --> 00:06:47,760
Is he out of his mind, or what?

97
00:06:48,183 --> 00:06:49,041
Honey...

98
00:06:49,204 --> 00:06:53,144
Is this the time to be losing
himself in romantic shenanigans?

99
00:06:53,266 --> 00:06:55,574
Honey, you don't need 
to worry about it.

100
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,476
Just leave it to me,
and I'll take care of her.

101
00:06:58,724 --> 00:07:02,137
Where did Minwoo move to?

102
00:07:09,396 --> 00:07:13,715
Director Hwang is 
urgently looking for you.

103
00:07:14,035 --> 00:07:14,844
What is the matter?

104
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:19,431
Hangang Construction was
given a construction permit.

105
00:07:20,466 --> 00:07:22,340
We're discussing a counterplan.

106
00:07:22,471 --> 00:07:25,096
Go meet the director.

107
00:07:26,394 --> 00:07:27,390
I have an appointment.

108
00:07:27,575 --> 00:07:28,404
What?

109
00:07:28,596 --> 00:07:31,466
Director Hwang seems to be
doing perfectly fine without me.

110
00:07:31,672 --> 00:07:33,933
So tell her to handle this by herself.

111
00:07:34,338 --> 00:07:35,508
Chief...

112
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:37,472
Chief!

113
00:07:38,862 --> 00:07:42,968
I'm only asking you to tell me based on
which standards that permit was given.

114
00:07:43,203 --> 00:07:43,788
Hello?

115
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:45,857
Hello?

116
00:07:52,551 --> 00:07:54,651
How about Chief Jo?

117
00:07:54,986 --> 00:07:58,495
Saying he had an appointment, he left.

118
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:02,870
You may leave.

119
00:08:20,559 --> 00:08:23,425
This is what top executives
drink at luxurious clubs these days,

120
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:24,660
it's called "bomb drink."

121
00:08:24,753 --> 00:08:25,648
Bomb drink?!

122
00:08:25,765 --> 00:08:28,761
So, what, if you drink that, 
your gut explodes?

123
00:08:28,952 --> 00:08:32,845
Wow... There's nothing our Gyeongja
doesn't know or can't do!

124
00:08:33,064 --> 00:08:35,360
Here... This is for Sotae Oppa.

125
00:08:35,587 --> 00:08:37,714
- Youngchul Oppa's.
- Thanks.

126
00:08:37,816 --> 00:08:39,369
And the president's...

127
00:08:39,626 --> 00:08:41,321
Here's yours.

128
00:08:41,428 --> 00:08:44,190
Here, I'll make a toast to
celebrate all your efforts.

129
00:08:44,729 --> 00:08:47,252
To our Hangang Construction's
apartment project!

130
00:08:47,383 --> 00:08:50,985
Cheers! Cheers! Cheers!

131
00:08:51,218 --> 00:08:53,230
One-shot!

132
00:09:05,965 --> 00:09:07,642
Dad.

133
00:09:11,214 --> 00:09:14,393
So your father is hopping from
place to place for your own sake,

134
00:09:14,685 --> 00:09:18,230
and you prance around 
dating in all leisure.

135
00:09:26,308 --> 00:09:28,264
I'll keep this short and sweet.

136
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:31,427
Dump that girl 
you're meeting right now.

137
00:09:32,418 --> 00:09:32,958
Dad...

138
00:09:33,046 --> 00:09:35,374
If you can't get rid of her, I will.

139
00:09:35,594 --> 00:09:37,708
But then if something happens to her,

140
00:09:37,932 --> 00:09:40,172
don't try to hold me responsible.

141
00:09:41,806 --> 00:09:43,468
Dad!

142
00:09:46,283 --> 00:09:49,915
If you ever lay a finger on her,

143
00:09:50,557 --> 00:09:52,909
I will die right under your watch.

144
00:09:54,275 --> 00:09:55,661
What?

145
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:58,155
Die?!

146
00:09:58,315 --> 00:09:59,601
Yes...

147
00:09:59,773 --> 00:10:01,929
I'll kill myself!

148
00:10:05,874 --> 00:10:08,091
Without Miju,

149
00:10:08,455 --> 00:10:10,788
my life would be meaningless anyway.

150
00:10:17,803 --> 00:10:19,961
So you'll kill yourself?!

151
00:10:21,069 --> 00:10:22,876
I made you!

152
00:10:22,988 --> 00:10:25,539
If anyone can decide
when you die, I'm the one!

153
00:10:36,607 --> 00:10:38,587
You'll die?!

154
00:10:38,792 --> 00:10:42,831
You dare say that in
your father's presence?

155
00:10:42,991 --> 00:10:45,465
Who the hell is that wench?

156
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:48,489
- Die!!
- Please, stop!

157
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:51,143
Stop it, Sir!

158
00:10:52,908 --> 00:10:55,347
This time...

159
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:57,928
I'm not going to give up.

160
00:10:58,118 --> 00:10:59,153
Minwoo!

161
00:10:59,323 --> 00:11:01,195
I'll never give Miju up!!

162
00:11:01,297 --> 00:11:03,082
You little bastard!

163
00:11:04,735 --> 00:11:06,697
Die!

164
00:11:14,075 --> 00:11:16,101
You have three days.

165
00:11:16,215 --> 00:11:18,850
If you really can't 
wrap things up with that wench,

166
00:11:18,942 --> 00:11:21,265
<i>find something that will convince me.</i>

167
00:11:21,361 --> 00:11:22,891
<i>If you fail to do so,</i>

168
00:11:23,051 --> 00:11:25,968
you won't be the only one I kill.

169
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:16,151
Minwoo!

170
00:12:23,037 --> 00:12:24,430
<i>Minwoo...</i>

171
00:12:24,627 --> 00:12:27,051
Wake up...

172
00:12:27,678 --> 00:12:29,224
Open your eyes...

173
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:32,443
I beg you, open your eyes...

174
00:12:42,422 --> 00:12:45,105
Stop crying.

175
00:12:46,023 --> 00:12:48,766
I'm all right...

176
00:12:51,462 --> 00:12:53,081
Who's all right?

177
00:12:53,183 --> 00:12:55,633
Look at all this blood.

178
00:12:56,722 --> 00:12:59,876
I said don't cry.

179
00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:17,795
It's late, so just go.

180
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:21,264
With you in this state,
how can I just go?

181
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:24,414
So, what, you'll spend the night here?

182
00:13:24,968 --> 00:13:27,681
I need to make you
breakfast in the morning...

183
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,889
Don't you worry about me.

184
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,104
You're the one who's hurting...

185
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:42,508
<i>Miju!</i>

186
00:13:45,877 --> 00:13:48,501
<i>Miju, it's me.</i>

187
00:14:35,253 --> 00:14:37,193
Minwoo.

188
00:14:37,529 --> 00:14:39,862
Are you sleeping?

189
00:15:15,235 --> 00:15:16,148
Five minutes...

190
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,957
No.

191
00:15:19,225 --> 00:15:21,106
Just one.

192
00:15:24,913 --> 00:15:28,558
Seeing you go through all that...

193
00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:31,227
because of someone 
as insignificant as me...

194
00:15:31,329 --> 00:15:33,119
Stop it.

195
00:15:43,473 --> 00:15:45,729
Thanks to you,

196
00:15:49,241 --> 00:15:52,727
I found happiness for
the first time in my life.

197
00:15:56,606 --> 00:15:59,712
I'll never let you go.

198
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:04,218
So don't even dream about leaving me.

199
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:07,135
Minwoo...

200
00:16:10,328 --> 00:16:13,391
To make you mine,

201
00:16:16,511 --> 00:16:19,486
there's nothing I can't do.

202
00:18:51,709 --> 00:18:52,796
<i>Miju.</i>

203
00:18:52,949 --> 00:18:55,150
<i>I came by last night.</i>

204
00:18:55,495 --> 00:18:58,577
<i>Did you sleep at a friend's?</i>

205
00:19:15,337 --> 00:19:18,958
<i>- Gaepo ----> Songpa -</i>

206
00:19:23,475 --> 00:19:26,683
You received an invitation
from Hangang Construction.

207
00:19:27,893 --> 00:19:31,714
I guess they're having
an official launch party.

208
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:35,170
Chief Moon.

209
00:19:35,327 --> 00:19:37,232
Here.

210
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:41,475
Isn't that the Songpa area?

211
00:19:42,029 --> 00:19:46,355
That is exactly where
we'll build our apartments, Songpa.

212
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:49,536
But land prices have already gone up,

213
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:51,304
so we'd be forced to incur
heavy expenses all on our own.

214
00:19:51,464 --> 00:19:53,593
Let's start by buying land there.

215
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:56,665
I will inform our 
shareholders afterwards.

216
00:19:56,765 --> 00:19:59,115
But... Director.

217
00:19:59,377 --> 00:20:02,935
Don't you know the reason why
we must build apartments there?

218
00:20:04,029 --> 00:20:07,850
It's to lure Gaepo buyers
into choosing us instead.

219
00:20:09,352 --> 00:20:11,250
All right.

220
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:15,187
When is Hangang Construction's
launch party, again?

221
00:20:15,433 --> 00:20:16,590
This evening.

222
00:20:16,762 --> 00:20:20,414
Make sure that all those who
received invitations participate.

223
00:20:20,504 --> 00:20:23,100
Are you going to go as well?

224
00:20:24,403 --> 00:20:29,484
The real war against Hangang
Construction is about to begin.

225
00:20:29,632 --> 00:20:32,722
Can't let them beat us
right off the bat, can we?

226
00:20:32,911 --> 00:20:35,684
<i>- Hangang Construction
Apartment Project Launch Ceremony -</i>

227
00:20:46,915 --> 00:20:51,465
I extend my sincerest gratitude
to all those who joined us,

228
00:20:51,698 --> 00:20:53,710
to officially celebrate our
Hangang Construction's launch.

229
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:56,510
We'll pay back 
your care and affection...

230
00:20:56,787 --> 00:21:01,217
by building strong
and long-lasting apartments.

231
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:19,654
Introduce yourself, will you?

232
00:21:19,747 --> 00:21:22,265
- He's one of Hangang Construction's directors.
- Director!

233
00:21:22,411 --> 00:21:24,292
<i>Not to mention my daughter.</i>

234
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:28,273
<i>We've been raising the president 
ever since he was little.</i>

235
00:21:33,086 --> 00:21:35,318
Congratulations, President Lee.

236
00:21:43,367 --> 00:21:45,176
Thank you.

237
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:52,738
You really should be thankful to me.

238
00:21:52,928 --> 00:21:57,034
If it weren't for me, this event
would have been impossible.

239
00:21:58,615 --> 00:22:01,736
"What did he really want to gain?"

240
00:22:02,129 --> 00:22:05,184
I kept asking myself.

241
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:10,929
So, did you find any answers?

242
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,202
Manbo Construction.

243
00:22:15,814 --> 00:22:22,292
Since taking down Chairman Hwang
must have been part of the same scheme.

244
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:27,087
Go around throwing
groundless accusations like that,

245
00:22:27,378 --> 00:22:28,721
and you might get hurt.

246
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,823
And I bet you put us and Manbo
Construction against each other...

247
00:22:33,066 --> 00:22:34,914
for the very same reason.

248
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:38,127
It seems you still don't
realize who you're talking to.

249
00:22:38,441 --> 00:22:40,891
Wise men never 
blow their own trumpets.

250
00:22:41,201 --> 00:22:44,201
You open a little rathole 
in a basement,

251
00:22:44,493 --> 00:22:47,085
and the delusions of grandeur
are already getting to your head?

252
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:56,494
You were prancing around talking
about playing it fair and square,

253
00:22:56,669 --> 00:23:01,001
but seems like our President Lee
is already feeling scared?!

254
00:23:02,182 --> 00:23:03,990
One day,

255
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:08,861
you will dearly regret
your decision to help me.

256
00:23:10,062 --> 00:23:14,554
Because things 
will not go as you wish.

257
00:23:15,414 --> 00:23:18,593
Feel free to act like 
a big shot all you want,

258
00:23:19,906 --> 00:23:23,230
but I can still crush you
with these hands of mine.

259
00:23:25,082 --> 00:23:29,804
If you'll excuse me,
I'll have to get going.

260
00:23:30,723 --> 00:23:33,377
I wish you a safe return, Sir.

261
00:24:13,153 --> 00:24:17,378
Hey... Hey, look... 
Hwang Jeongshik!

262
00:24:30,444 --> 00:24:32,267
Wow... Lee Gangmo!

263
00:24:32,355 --> 00:24:34,843
You sure turned your fortunes around?!

264
00:24:35,309 --> 00:24:37,030
Congratulations.

265
00:24:45,415 --> 00:24:48,135
Aren't you going to shake my hand?

266
00:24:56,015 --> 00:25:01,002
You were the one who invited me,
but it feels like I'm crashing this party?!

267
00:25:03,206 --> 00:25:05,369
Thank you for coming.

268
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:08,412
I hope you'll enjoy the party.

269
00:25:10,001 --> 00:25:15,907
You will come to our launch party 
for the Songpa apartments, right?

270
00:25:17,001 --> 00:25:21,028
We decided to build right next
to your apartments in Gaepo.

271
00:25:21,218 --> 00:25:26,001
Guess we'll be forced to fight
each other to lure in buyers?

272
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:35,028
All those buyers...

273
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:38,099
will desert any sale you try to open.

274
00:25:39,192 --> 00:25:41,467
Before you try to take us down,

275
00:25:41,729 --> 00:25:44,850
<i>I suggest you worry about
protecting your own company.</i>

276
00:25:48,977 --> 00:25:50,829
Minwoo.

277
00:25:53,221 --> 00:25:54,838
I'd like to go home now,

278
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,479
can you drive me there?

279
00:26:15,557 --> 00:26:19,485
Never imagined even I
would get an invitation.

280
00:26:19,917 --> 00:26:25,836
I hope you still don't
bear ill will against me?

281
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:28,431
It's already all in the past.

282
00:26:28,621 --> 00:26:30,721
I didn't want to come, to be honest.

283
00:26:30,838 --> 00:26:35,548
But I thought I'd take a look and see...

284
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:38,493
how big our house servant 
managed to make it.

285
00:26:38,668 --> 00:26:41,975
Thanks.
Glad you came.

286
00:26:42,937 --> 00:26:45,942
Come to my office, one of these days.

287
00:26:46,233 --> 00:26:48,391
I'll treat you.

288
00:27:14,987 --> 00:27:16,175
What the hell?

289
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:18,392
<i>Why did you lock the door?</i>

290
00:27:22,467 --> 00:27:24,057
You little...

291
00:27:28,694 --> 00:27:33,467
You taught me a very precious lesson.

292
00:27:34,007 --> 00:27:36,457
That always silently enduring things...

293
00:27:36,763 --> 00:27:39,971
is what only retards do.

294
00:27:40,088 --> 00:27:42,188
You little bastard...

295
00:27:49,829 --> 00:27:54,679
Gangmo... I'm sorry...
Please, don't...

296
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:59,470
Don't do it..
I'm sorry! Gangmo...

297
00:28:04,115 --> 00:28:07,221
Just buy it and enough with
the prattling, you cheapskate.

298
00:28:07,309 --> 00:28:10,575
Ahh... What do you take me for?
Being cheap is your forte.

299
00:28:10,692 --> 00:28:14,965
- As if you didn't know...
- You sorry-ass little...

300
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:19,946
Is it locked?

301
00:28:20,777 --> 00:28:23,606
Looks like they've got some
business going on inside.

302
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:25,487
Why, need to use the men's room?

303
00:28:25,604 --> 00:28:29,191
The cleaning lady just made
a mess, so better not bother.

304
00:28:29,293 --> 00:28:30,562
Use the other room.

305
00:28:30,664 --> 00:28:32,385
I said go elsewhere!

306
00:28:32,457 --> 00:28:34,799
What are you staring at?

307
00:28:35,032 --> 00:28:38,751
My... This is serious, all right.

308
00:28:54,131 --> 00:28:56,615
That'll do it.

309
00:28:57,549 --> 00:28:59,386
I might not forgive you,

310
00:28:59,706 --> 00:29:02,084
but let's just pretend we're even.

311
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:08,754
For getting away with murder like this,

312
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:10,907
you should consider yourself lucky.

313
00:29:11,131 --> 00:29:12,821
Right?

314
00:29:20,012 --> 00:29:21,806
Wipe the blood.

315
00:29:27,673 --> 00:29:30,089
You just wait, Lee Gangmo.

316
00:29:30,293 --> 00:29:33,268
When I become chairman
of Manbo Construction,

317
00:29:33,467 --> 00:29:37,235
I'll trample on you
every step of the way.

318
00:29:48,316 --> 00:29:51,030
Ahh... Here is President Lee.

319
00:29:51,135 --> 00:29:52,559
Sorry for making you wait.

320
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,410
I was having a word with a guest, 
so I'm a little late.

321
00:29:55,709 --> 00:29:58,028
Is there anything else you need?

322
00:29:58,265 --> 00:29:59,662
<i>Yes.</i>

323
00:30:24,046 --> 00:30:27,108
I hope you didn't misunderstand me.

324
00:30:28,129 --> 00:30:30,378
Misunderstand?!

325
00:30:30,845 --> 00:30:33,222
Even if I hurt your feelings, 
can't help it.

326
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:35,876
It was for the company's sake.

327
00:30:37,174 --> 00:30:44,130
I see you're still looking down on me.

328
00:30:47,904 --> 00:30:50,251
Just a word of warning.

329
00:30:50,733 --> 00:30:54,218
You and Lee Gangmo weren't
the only ones who changed.

330
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:58,738
I might have danced to your tune today,

331
00:30:59,511 --> 00:31:02,948
but I have no intention of getting
involved in your little love quarrels.

332
00:31:06,987 --> 00:31:10,079
Next time you try 
to do anything like that,

333
00:31:11,154 --> 00:31:13,535
I won't just play along.

334
00:31:33,201 --> 00:31:35,951
Love quarrels?!

335
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:52,297
Chief Moon?

336
00:31:52,425 --> 00:31:54,058
Sorry for calling you at this hour.

337
00:31:54,216 --> 00:31:55,283
<i>It's all right.</i>

338
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,689
<i>But, what do I owe...</i>

339
00:31:57,908 --> 00:32:01,687
Aren't you tired of being just
a department chief at your age?

340
00:32:01,785 --> 00:32:03,289
<i>Excuse me?</i>

341
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:06,118
- Why... are you suddenly...
- I will give you a chance...

342
00:32:06,249 --> 00:32:08,970
to finally make it big once and for all.

343
00:32:09,874 --> 00:32:13,009
We'll discuss details tomorrow at work.

344
00:32:22,926 --> 00:32:25,765
Lee Gangmo, Hwang Jeongyeon...

345
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:31,262
So Jo Minwoo is nothing to you?

346
00:32:32,473 --> 00:32:34,616
You just wait...

347
00:32:35,275 --> 00:32:38,335
The last laugh in this fight...

348
00:32:38,817 --> 00:32:42,194
will not be yours, but mine.

349
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:48,377
I now have a reason
not to let you defeat me.

350
00:32:48,946 --> 00:32:50,754
<i>You have three days.</i>

351
00:32:50,998 --> 00:32:53,554
If you really can't 
wrap things up with that wench,

352
00:32:53,745 --> 00:32:55,858
find something that will convince me.

353
00:32:56,087 --> 00:32:57,661
If you fail to do so,

354
00:32:57,785 --> 00:33:00,563
you won't be the only one I kill.

355
00:33:03,742 --> 00:33:06,878
If only for Miju's sake,

356
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,121
I'll never lose to you.

357
00:33:13,669 --> 00:33:15,636
Oppa...

358
00:33:16,859 --> 00:33:18,599
Miju.

359
00:33:19,032 --> 00:33:20,545
What could this... be?!

360
00:33:20,661 --> 00:33:22,625
Wow? A cassette player?

361
00:33:22,717 --> 00:33:24,125
I hear you did well at the test.

362
00:33:24,218 --> 00:33:25,775
Gift from Oppa!

363
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,304
Big Oppa, you rock!

364
00:33:27,401 --> 00:33:29,088
I really wanted one of these...

365
00:33:29,161 --> 00:33:31,359
- Really?
- Yeah.

366
00:33:35,694 --> 00:33:38,198
How does this work...

367
00:33:44,715 --> 00:33:46,850
What is that ring?

368
00:33:48,215 --> 00:33:49,731
Why are you hiding it?

369
00:33:49,935 --> 00:33:51,437
Give me your hand.

370
00:33:51,605 --> 00:33:53,275
Come on.

371
00:33:56,104 --> 00:33:57,795
Wow... Looks great?!

372
00:33:57,986 --> 00:33:59,486
It... It's a fake.

373
00:33:59,677 --> 00:34:01,369
It's glass.

374
00:34:02,886 --> 00:34:05,190
Wanna tell me where you
spent the night last time?

375
00:34:05,397 --> 00:34:07,202
Uh? When?

376
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,682
<i>That night.</i>

377
00:34:08,836 --> 00:34:12,463
I waited for you all night,
and then left in the morning.

378
00:34:13,502 --> 00:34:15,006
At a friend's.

379
00:34:15,923 --> 00:34:17,549
Friend who?

380
00:34:19,168 --> 00:34:20,753
Big Oppa...

381
00:34:20,991 --> 00:34:24,880
I can't tell anyone 
about you yet, right?

382
00:34:25,074 --> 00:34:27,145
Why, is there someone 
you'd like to tell?

383
00:34:27,509 --> 00:34:29,295
Yeah.

384
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:32,240
- Actually...
- Miju.

385
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:34,882
No matter how close you might be,

386
00:34:35,302 --> 00:34:36,965
you still need to keep it secret.

387
00:34:37,111 --> 00:34:41,427
Can't you at least tell me
why I should keep doing that?

388
00:34:42,156 --> 00:34:45,642
It's because of things
Gangmo and I have planned.

389
00:34:45,895 --> 00:34:47,849
You trust me, right?

390
00:34:48,143 --> 00:34:50,512
All right, Oppa.

391
00:34:51,947 --> 00:34:54,207
Let's listen to something.

392
00:34:57,576 --> 00:34:59,573
Here...

393
00:35:05,954 --> 00:35:08,462
What are you doing?
Clap your hands.

394
00:35:09,234 --> 00:35:12,764
"Just a look and my heart throbs."

395
00:35:12,924 --> 00:35:16,424
"Just a thought and my heart throbs."

396
00:35:16,628 --> 00:35:24,045
"Ignore the blooming first love
of an innocent nineteen-year-old."

397
00:35:24,395 --> 00:35:27,385
<i>"So that nobody 
in the world will know,"</i>

398
00:35:27,501 --> 00:35:28,332
Our Miju is great!

399
00:35:28,434 --> 00:35:32,620
"And he will remain hidden
at the bottom of my heart."

400
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:38,530
Oppa...

401
00:35:38,646 --> 00:35:41,106
You're messing up all the beats.

402
00:35:41,825 --> 00:35:45,577
Why... 
Didn't I, like, get it right?

403
00:35:45,777 --> 00:35:49,044
Do it right, will you?

404
00:35:59,057 --> 00:36:01,404
Where did you take my father to?

405
00:36:01,696 --> 00:36:02,761
None of your business.

406
00:36:02,918 --> 00:36:05,201
What is it that you're scheming?

407
00:36:05,444 --> 00:36:08,132
Based on his testament,
should your father die,

408
00:36:08,319 --> 00:36:11,107
<i>Jeongshik will inherit 
his company shares.</i>

409
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:13,980
So you did that just because you
feared I would get his testament changed?

410
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:16,582
Since you're more than capable of that.

411
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:21,723
So you're not going to let me 
meet him until he dies?

412
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,558
Why, can't I?

413
00:36:23,774 --> 00:36:28,513
You people will be punished for this.

414
00:36:29,301 --> 00:36:31,065
Punished?

415
00:36:31,459 --> 00:36:33,792
And who would be punishing us?

416
00:36:35,032 --> 00:36:37,181
I'm afraid that the day
that testament comes into play,

417
00:36:37,356 --> 00:36:40,156
you'll be the one who is punished.

418
00:36:41,002 --> 00:36:44,531
For biting the hand
that fed and raised you.

419
00:37:01,818 --> 00:37:05,026
You're telling me you still
haven't fixed that testament?

420
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:06,630
It'll soon be complete.

421
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:09,233
And how "soon" will that be?

422
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:12,937
I'll call you the moment it's ready.

423
00:37:13,094 --> 00:37:15,051
You know that we don't
have a minute to waste, right?

424
00:37:15,241 --> 00:37:18,133
But, where is the chairman...

425
00:37:18,231 --> 00:37:22,973
I thought I already told you
not to worry about the chairman?

426
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,908
Yes.

427
00:37:25,108 --> 00:37:28,911
Anyhow, I'll be counting on you.

428
00:37:29,064 --> 00:37:30,347
Yes.

429
00:37:41,664 --> 00:37:44,849
Do right as Madame Oh asked you.

430
00:37:45,276 --> 00:37:49,443
Since as long as Lee Gangmo doesn't
inherit Chairman Hwang's fortune,

431
00:37:49,501 --> 00:37:51,330
everything is fine with me.

432
00:37:51,499 --> 00:37:53,484
All right.

433
00:37:53,672 --> 00:37:56,472
But, about keeping this secret...

434
00:37:56,588 --> 00:38:00,987
I'll take it to my grave,
so you don't need to worry.

435
00:38:09,226 --> 00:38:10,494
Instead,

436
00:38:10,713 --> 00:38:15,525
I'll only bother you once with a
little favor in the near future.

437
00:38:52,732 --> 00:38:54,730
There's something strange at play.

438
00:38:54,964 --> 00:38:58,566
There are no traces of Chairman Hwang,

439
00:38:59,338 --> 00:39:03,799
and those two have been visiting that 
lawyer even more frequently as of late.

440
00:39:05,607 --> 00:39:08,392
Keep watching Oh Namsuk
and Hwang Jeongshik.

441
00:39:08,771 --> 00:39:10,667
I'm sure they'll 
go meet Chairman Hwang.

442
00:39:10,842 --> 00:39:12,782
All right.

443
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:18,469
<i>Gyeongok...</i>

444
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:22,459
<i>I think I'm being punished.</i>

445
00:39:22,717 --> 00:39:24,924
For abandoning you,

446
00:39:25,256 --> 00:39:26,980
and...

447
00:39:27,222 --> 00:39:31,690
for what I did to my friend.

448
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:36,802
Where are you now?

449
00:39:37,534 --> 00:39:40,725
What are they doing to you?

450
00:39:57,971 --> 00:40:01,339
<i>You miss your family, don't you?</i>

451
00:40:12,803 --> 00:40:15,194
Have you given it a thought?

452
00:40:15,458 --> 00:40:19,730
I'll put my future in your hands.

453
00:40:21,173 --> 00:40:26,115
Just tell me what you want me to do.

454
00:40:29,615 --> 00:40:34,821
You're in charge of the land we bought
around the residential area, right?

455
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:36,279
Yes.

456
00:40:36,575 --> 00:40:39,881
Transfer it all under a namesake.

457
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:42,736
A name...sake?!

458
00:40:43,068 --> 00:40:45,622
But it's under company name...

459
00:40:45,762 --> 00:40:48,722
The only people aware of
that land besides us...

460
00:40:48,936 --> 00:40:52,484
are the chairman, 
Hwang Jeongyeon and Director Ju.

461
00:40:53,126 --> 00:40:58,038
And they're in no position to be
worrying about that land now.

462
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,529
I'll do as you wish.

463
00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:03,529
In due time, that land...

464
00:41:03,898 --> 00:41:06,712
will all be turned into cash.

465
00:41:07,252 --> 00:41:08,491
Make all preparations.

466
00:41:08,637 --> 00:41:10,175
Yes, Chief.

467
00:41:10,268 --> 00:41:15,068
I'll be counting on you
and will proceed as you wish.

468
00:41:26,049 --> 00:41:27,813
You're my son, all right!

469
00:41:28,003 --> 00:41:32,182
It's a perfect way to get
your hands on Manbo Construction.

470
00:41:37,481 --> 00:41:42,711
Jeongshik will soon inherit the company.

471
00:41:43,498 --> 00:41:46,076
Not Jeongyeon, but Jeongshik?

472
00:41:46,217 --> 00:41:51,797
Jeongshik will be a
much better prey for you.

473
00:41:53,999 --> 00:41:55,966
See, Minwoo?

474
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:58,548
They don't say "like father,
like son" for nothing.

475
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:04,123
Your plans and mine are
like a match made in heaven!

476
00:42:06,427 --> 00:42:09,431
Ohh... Come on in.

477
00:42:10,218 --> 00:42:12,216
Any good news to share with us?

478
00:42:12,391 --> 00:42:13,966
We could hear you 
laughing from outside.

479
00:42:14,054 --> 00:42:15,541
Is that so?

480
00:42:15,964 --> 00:42:18,808
He's come back to the
Minwoo we all knew.

481
00:42:18,997 --> 00:42:20,007
Ahh... No!

482
00:42:20,202 --> 00:42:22,754
He's come back even stronger.

483
00:42:24,606 --> 00:42:29,053
So it seems like it's your
turn to hear my demands?!

484
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:33,355
I will marry that woman.

485
00:42:36,246 --> 00:42:37,182
Fine.

486
00:42:37,354 --> 00:42:38,856
I'll allow you two to date.

487
00:42:39,007 --> 00:42:41,860
But you'll only get married when
all our plans come into fruition.

488
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:45,559
I'll also introduce her 
to you before that.

489
00:42:45,754 --> 00:42:47,854
That's natural!

490
00:42:49,266 --> 00:42:51,864
Minwoo... 
You were seeing someone?

491
00:42:52,035 --> 00:42:53,226
Don't even start.

492
00:42:53,331 --> 00:42:57,453
That lady completely
took his soul away.

493
00:42:58,299 --> 00:43:00,194
Congrats.

494
00:43:00,905 --> 00:43:01,842
Thanks, Hyung.

495
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:04,511
We can't not celebrate this 
with a drink.

496
00:43:04,657 --> 00:43:07,805
- Here... Let's all drink.
- Yes.

497
00:43:08,987 --> 00:43:11,903
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

498
00:44:10,369 --> 00:44:12,569
<i>A sales war is about to begin.</i>

499
00:44:12,765 --> 00:44:14,223
If we want to defeat 
Manbo Construction,

500
00:44:14,354 --> 00:44:17,227
we must find out what our customers want,
and focus our publicity on that.

501
00:44:17,344 --> 00:44:21,500
But, won't publicity cost us money?

502
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:25,329
Can we ever compete with
Manbo Construction's resources?

503
00:44:25,539 --> 00:44:29,325
Whatever the case, 
we must defeat them at all cost.

504
00:44:29,471 --> 00:44:30,946
Money is the problem, all right.

505
00:44:31,148 --> 00:44:33,769
Let's start by using 
all that we have left.

506
00:44:33,992 --> 00:44:37,016
I'll see what I can do
about finding ulterior funds.

507
00:44:37,126 --> 00:44:41,446
Make sure our newspaper ads are shown
right alongside Hangang Construction's.

508
00:44:41,554 --> 00:44:45,017
They also must be twice
the size of their ads.

509
00:44:45,129 --> 00:44:47,766
But that'll cost us quite the amount?!

510
00:44:47,892 --> 00:44:51,101
It's not like Hangang Construction
could ever compete with us.

511
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:55,512
- I don't see any...
- Erase any such indolence from your mind!

512
00:44:55,833 --> 00:45:00,058
We're dealing with the same
product, clients and start date.

513
00:45:00,339 --> 00:45:03,410
Don't you realize we were at war 
from the very first moment?

514
00:45:03,519 --> 00:45:06,378
<i>From the smallest newspaper ad 
to the final sales,</i>

515
00:45:06,483 --> 00:45:09,564
trample on every single piece of promotion 
Hangang Construction comes up with.

516
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:11,630
Even if you have to 
throw money at them,

517
00:45:11,741 --> 00:45:16,958
you must show them what's the price 
to pay for trying to challenge us.

518
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:18,136
Is that clear?

519
00:45:18,233 --> 00:45:19,884
- Yes.
- Yes, we understand.

520
00:45:19,993 --> 00:45:21,256
How's the situation at the site?

521
00:45:21,351 --> 00:45:22,572
Going as planned.

522
00:45:22,718 --> 00:45:24,252
Let's speed up the construction.

523
00:45:24,482 --> 00:45:29,936
We must complete it before
Hangang Construction does.

524
00:45:30,928 --> 00:45:33,712
Our ad is in the newspaper!

525
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:35,145
How is it?

526
00:45:35,265 --> 00:45:36,609
Does it look good?

527
00:45:36,732 --> 00:45:37,897
You're dying to see it, aren't you?

528
00:45:38,029 --> 00:45:40,449
Better raise your expectations...

529
00:45:43,082 --> 00:45:45,320
<i>{\a6}- Manbo Construction -</i>

529
00:45:43,082 --> 00:45:45,320
<i>"Neither big nor small,
just the apartment you want."</i>

530
00:45:45,627 --> 00:45:47,055
<i>Wait a moment...</i>

531
00:45:47,187 --> 00:45:51,630
Am I starting to get old here?
I really can't see it.

532
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:53,161
Where is ours?

533
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:56,657
This one is just Manbo Construction's.

534
00:45:56,909 --> 00:45:58,181
It's over here.

535
00:45:58,323 --> 00:46:00,443
<i>Here.</i>

536
00:46:02,658 --> 00:46:04,054
We're screwed, all right.

537
00:46:04,171 --> 00:46:08,387
When theirs is so huge,
who's going to look at ours?

538
00:46:10,049 --> 00:46:12,718
It's the same for 
every other newspaper.

539
00:46:13,753 --> 00:46:15,867
We should have 
just used some leaflets.

540
00:46:16,027 --> 00:46:18,853
After spending all that money, 
all we get is...

541
00:46:23,441 --> 00:46:27,218
<i>- Ohh... Reporter Yoon?
- Yes. How are you?</i>

542
00:46:31,593 --> 00:46:33,936
I asked around at every newspaper,

543
00:46:34,145 --> 00:46:35,982
and it seems that Director 
Hwang Jeongyeon asked to be put...

544
00:46:36,099 --> 00:46:41,688
side by side with your ads 
on every single one of them.

545
00:46:45,859 --> 00:46:47,740
Why don't you forget newspaper ads,

546
00:46:47,915 --> 00:46:50,773
and instead focus on radio and TV?

547
00:46:51,005 --> 00:46:53,661
We're quickly running out of cash.

548
00:46:54,171 --> 00:46:59,068
We must carve our niche with
a unique advertising campaign.

549
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:01,981
Do you have anything in mind?

550
00:47:03,498 --> 00:47:06,706
Apartments for the working class.

551
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:08,257
The working class?!

552
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:13,716
It's exactly what I wanted to build 
ever since I cut my teeth on this business.

553
00:47:14,675 --> 00:47:18,816
Done the right way,
it could be quite a hit.

554
00:47:25,583 --> 00:47:29,626
Hangang Construction is
planning a new marketing campaign.

555
00:47:29,909 --> 00:47:31,469
I know.

556
00:47:31,697 --> 00:47:34,789
It's about apartments
for the working class, right?

557
00:47:36,582 --> 00:47:41,416
Let's change our concept
for radio and TV ads to that.

558
00:47:41,555 --> 00:47:43,268
Manbo Construction's brand image...

559
00:47:43,428 --> 00:47:45,309
has always been that of building 
luxurious, top-of-the-line apartments.

560
00:47:45,411 --> 00:47:46,558
Couldn't care less.

561
00:47:46,663 --> 00:47:48,999
Don't you realize how
much money it'd take to...

562
00:47:49,101 --> 00:47:50,982
redraw a campaign from scratch,
when production is already complete?

563
00:47:51,099 --> 00:47:52,586
<i>Chief Jo!</i>

564
00:47:52,746 --> 00:47:55,399
What are you, trying to lecture me?

565
00:47:55,984 --> 00:47:58,519
If your superior tells you to change them, 
stop arguing and just do it!

566
00:47:58,644 --> 00:48:01,296
What on earth are
you trying to accomplish?

567
00:48:01,899 --> 00:48:04,859
Is it just bringing down 
Hangang Construction, or...

568
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:09,555
Bringing Lee Gangmo down
will lead us to success.

569
00:48:09,847 --> 00:48:12,158
You still don't realize that?

570
00:48:13,151 --> 00:48:15,726
Proceed as instructed right away.

571
00:48:24,219 --> 00:48:27,529
I won't make you 
wait for long, Lee Gangmo.

572
00:48:28,404 --> 00:48:31,492
It won't take long.

573
00:48:39,673 --> 00:48:42,269
Hwang Jeongyeon...

574
00:48:43,785 --> 00:48:46,585
You will soon pay a very hefty price...

575
00:48:47,358 --> 00:48:51,077
for looking down on me.

576
00:48:57,464 --> 00:49:00,187
It's the testament revision.

577
00:49:01,022 --> 00:49:03,416
Good job, Mister Kim.

578
00:49:05,861 --> 00:49:08,442
Did you bring the
chairman's original testament?

579
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:11,169
Yes... Here it is.

580
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:15,463
I'll deal with this personally.

581
00:49:15,690 --> 00:49:16,926
As you wish.

582
00:49:17,133 --> 00:49:20,183
- If you'll excuse me...
- Yes.

583
00:49:24,426 --> 00:49:25,412
Mom.

584
00:49:25,578 --> 00:49:29,355
Then, am I really becoming
chairman of Manbo Construction?

585
00:49:29,516 --> 00:49:31,470
That's right, my boy!

586
00:49:31,616 --> 00:49:33,016
It's all over now.

587
00:49:33,176 --> 00:49:37,403
Manbo Construction is yours!

588
00:49:40,363 --> 00:49:43,644
You're the best!

589
00:49:44,368 --> 00:49:47,640
But you can't tell anyone, yet.
Got it?

590
00:49:47,844 --> 00:49:50,877
Ehh... What do you take me for?

591
00:49:51,805 --> 00:49:53,601
But, listen...

592
00:49:53,817 --> 00:49:57,003
What if Dad ends up recovering?

593
00:49:57,171 --> 00:49:58,367
Don't you worry.

594
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:02,134
By the time he does,
you'll already be chairman.

595
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:04,083
Right...

596
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:06,752
I'll have to organize 
a party with my friends.

597
00:50:06,863 --> 00:50:09,620
Mom, I'll be right back!

598
00:50:10,170 --> 00:50:11,880
Watch what you say.

599
00:50:12,055 --> 00:50:14,786
- Got it?
- Yeah.

600
00:50:22,846 --> 00:50:23,879
Get the car ready.

601
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:28,342
No, I'll be driving personally.

602
00:50:44,931 --> 00:50:48,066
<i>Oh Namsuk has finally made a move.</i>

603
00:50:48,868 --> 00:50:52,339
Stick to her until you 
find out where she's going.

604
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:05,787
Honey.

605
00:51:05,977 --> 00:51:07,698
I'm here.

606
00:51:10,761 --> 00:51:12,938
Happy to see me?

607
00:51:17,881 --> 00:51:18,888
<i>- Testament -</i>

608
00:51:18,990 --> 00:51:21,163
<i>Know what this is, right?</i>

609
00:51:21,653 --> 00:51:24,035
<i>Your testament.</i>

610
00:51:25,946 --> 00:51:28,673
You thought that leaving
all your fortune to Gangmo,

611
00:51:28,848 --> 00:51:31,859
Jeongyeon would end up 
receiving all that, right?

612
00:51:32,185 --> 00:51:36,409
But I'm afraid I
have no more use for this.

613
00:51:37,634 --> 00:51:41,556
I fixed your testament.

614
00:51:53,745 --> 00:51:57,609
Jeongshik will soon
replace you as chairman.

615
00:51:58,834 --> 00:52:01,372
<i>And as for your daughter Jeongyeon,</i>

616
00:52:01,608 --> 00:52:03,663
she'll just end up on the street.

617
00:52:03,772 --> 00:52:05,129
<i>Namsuk...</i>

618
00:52:05,228 --> 00:52:08,174
<i>What is wrong with you?</i>

619
00:52:08,392 --> 00:52:10,288
Feel wronged, I bet?

620
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:13,890
Think I'm taking things too far?

621
00:52:14,634 --> 00:52:21,510
But you'll resent me even more 
for what I'm about to do.

622
00:52:34,106 --> 00:52:37,535
You really think this is all my fault?

623
00:52:38,089 --> 00:52:42,793
No... You're to blame.

624
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:45,716
Hwang Taeseop, you!

625
00:52:55,887 --> 00:52:57,841
Why...

626
00:52:58,774 --> 00:53:01,559
Why are you staring at me that way?

627
00:53:02,391 --> 00:53:06,182
<i>Did you hate me that much?</i>

628
00:53:07,463 --> 00:53:09,038
<i>Fine, then.</i>

629
00:53:09,277 --> 00:53:12,363
<i>I'll be content with
the life I've lived so far.</i>

630
00:53:12,881 --> 00:53:16,359
<i>I'll just be thankful for that, and go.</i>

631
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:18,648
<i>Namsuk.</i>

632
00:53:18,856 --> 00:53:21,331
Don't look at me that way.

633
00:53:21,650 --> 00:53:24,027
I'd rather see eyes 
filled with resentment.

634
00:53:24,289 --> 00:53:25,645
Curse at me...

635
00:53:25,952 --> 00:53:30,356
Call me a shameless wench,
say one day I will be punished!

636
00:53:57,926 --> 00:53:59,851
Die...

637
00:54:01,207 --> 00:54:03,103
Don't ever think of surviving,

638
00:54:03,541 --> 00:54:05,655
just die.

639
00:54:38,309 --> 00:54:39,727
I found out.

640
00:54:39,856 --> 00:54:44,559
Bribe one of the nurses there,
and keep an eye on him.

641
00:54:44,705 --> 00:54:46,674
What are you planning to do?

642
00:54:46,855 --> 00:54:48,846
You may leave.

643
00:55:00,498 --> 00:55:04,739
If anything is going
to happen to Jeongyeon,

644
00:55:05,934 --> 00:55:08,895
I must get him out of there.

645
00:55:10,542 --> 00:55:12,438
And that's because...

646
00:55:13,109 --> 00:55:16,200
he's my daughter's father.

647
00:55:19,308 --> 00:55:25,520
Because from the very start, 
he was mine.

648
00:55:39,111 --> 00:55:40,022
Ohh... Stop!

649
00:55:40,131 --> 00:55:41,270
Wait... Stop it!

650
00:55:41,363 --> 00:55:42,836
Stop it.

651
00:55:42,923 --> 00:55:44,754
What is this?

652
00:55:51,209 --> 00:55:54,136
There's another one.

653
00:56:06,064 --> 00:56:09,650
So you found these relics
at the construction site?

654
00:56:09,867 --> 00:56:12,740
And not just all from the same place.

655
00:56:12,930 --> 00:56:16,579
This area was once a Baekje fortress.

656
00:56:17,815 --> 00:56:19,473
Cover it up.

657
00:56:20,002 --> 00:56:20,644
What?

658
00:56:20,790 --> 00:56:22,768
Just cover up the whole thing,
and go on with the construction.

659
00:56:22,859 --> 00:56:25,573
But if the Cultural Heritage
Administration finds out...

660
00:56:25,685 --> 00:56:28,789
I'll take full responsibility, 
so tell your men to keep their mouths shut.

661
00:56:28,949 --> 00:56:29,556
Yes.

662
00:56:29,736 --> 00:56:31,574
As you wish.

663
00:56:36,313 --> 00:56:38,078
Chief Moon.

664
00:56:38,646 --> 00:56:42,407
Nobody in the company 
must learn of this.

665
00:56:42,624 --> 00:56:47,057
So you don't even plan
to report it to Director Hwang?

666
00:56:49,843 --> 00:56:51,675
How did it go with
that land I told you about?

667
00:56:51,784 --> 00:56:52,876
Ahh... Yes.

668
00:56:52,984 --> 00:56:56,324
As you instructed me,
I transferred it under a namesake.

669
00:56:56,747 --> 00:56:59,693
I think we might have
to rush with our plans.

670
00:57:00,509 --> 00:57:02,530
Change it into cash.

671
00:57:02,755 --> 00:57:04,913
All right, Chief.

672
00:57:51,650 --> 00:57:53,400
As you can see,

673
00:57:53,662 --> 00:57:57,585
Hangang Construction can't even 
compete with our sales record.

674
00:57:57,816 --> 00:58:01,819
Our aggressive marketing campaign
focusing on our brand name...

675
00:58:02,038 --> 00:58:04,276
seems to be making a mark already.

676
00:58:04,432 --> 00:58:05,640
If the situation continues,

677
00:58:05,756 --> 00:58:11,269
we will triumph over Hangang
Construction by a wide margin.

678
00:58:38,462 --> 00:58:39,771
Yes.

679
00:58:39,935 --> 00:58:41,889
<i>President Lee Gangmo?</i>

680
00:58:42,137 --> 00:58:44,820
<i>I'm Hwang Jeongyeon.</i>

681
00:59:13,846 --> 00:59:16,719
Among the things
I've learned from my father...

682
00:59:16,938 --> 00:59:19,402
was the logic behind power.

683
00:59:19,650 --> 00:59:25,153
The fact the small
can never defeat the big.

684
00:59:28,886 --> 00:59:32,590
You'll never defeat me.

685
00:59:32,926 --> 00:59:35,135
The fight is not over yet.

686
00:59:35,346 --> 00:59:38,292
My father also told me this.

687
00:59:39,105 --> 00:59:41,525
That those who acknowledge defeat...

688
00:59:42,036 --> 00:59:46,367
can be much scarier than
someone who never gives up.

689
00:59:47,373 --> 00:59:49,998
You're still not up to the task.

690
00:59:50,392 --> 00:59:51,471
Do you know that?

691
00:59:51,624 --> 00:59:54,662
And all that your father
gained from such wisdom...

692
00:59:55,115 --> 00:59:58,075
was collapsing in the end.

693
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:01,793
I admit it.

694
01:00:02,158 --> 01:00:04,899
Every time I look at you,

695
01:00:05,264 --> 01:00:08,399
I can barely contain my surprise.

696
01:00:09,624 --> 01:00:12,794
You look like someone
ready to grow into a giant.

697
01:00:13,451 --> 01:00:15,317
<i>But...</i>

698
01:00:15,773 --> 01:00:18,073
what you most resemble...

699
01:00:18,648 --> 01:00:21,398
is your father.

700
01:00:23,046 --> 01:00:25,744
Your father always told me.

701
01:00:27,761 --> 01:00:30,590
That he always ran into the dark 
without an end in sight.

702
01:00:31,002 --> 01:00:32,393
My father and I are different.

703
01:00:32,504 --> 01:00:34,615
I pray that's true.

704
01:00:34,819 --> 01:00:39,500
Hand Hangang Construction to me.

705
01:00:41,906 --> 01:00:47,070
Leave the company to me,
and get out of this business.

706
01:00:47,916 --> 01:00:50,497
On the condition you won't
interfere with management,

707
01:00:50,686 --> 01:00:52,524
you'll be generously compensated.

708
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:55,893
Do you know what my dream is?

709
01:00:56,957 --> 01:00:59,903
And you want to trample on that?

710
01:01:02,604 --> 01:01:04,981
Because...

711
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:09,896
the sole fact that someone
like you shares my same dream...

712
01:01:10,436 --> 01:01:13,060
is too hard to bear.

713
01:01:20,170 --> 01:01:22,358
I'll be waiting for an answer.

714
01:01:22,635 --> 01:01:24,589
Hope you'll reflect carefully.

715
01:01:24,803 --> 01:01:27,987
Stature alone is not 
what makes a giant.

716
01:01:29,372 --> 01:01:35,189
Even the smallest things can defeat 
seemingly insurmountable odds.

717
01:01:36,924 --> 01:01:39,534
That's my "logic of power."

718
01:02:00,699 --> 01:02:02,010
What did I tell you?

719
01:02:02,288 --> 01:02:05,101
Didn't I tell you that 
providence would be on our side?

720
01:02:06,879 --> 01:02:10,962
That's enough to stop
the construction, right?

721
01:02:12,843 --> 01:02:15,322
Hwang Jeongyeon ventured into
this Songpa apartment campaign...

722
01:02:15,570 --> 01:02:18,938
solely because of Lee Gangmo.

723
01:02:19,434 --> 01:02:22,253
If we manage to stop the construction,

724
01:02:22,661 --> 01:02:23,536
it'll be the end for Hwang Jeongyeon.

725
01:02:23,653 --> 01:02:28,485
Once the press is let in on this, 
it will be game over.

726
01:02:28,625 --> 01:02:30,842
I don't want to wait any longer.

727
01:02:33,554 --> 01:02:35,237
Back in the day,

728
01:02:35,406 --> 01:02:39,027
the situation forced me 
to get rid of someone,

729
01:02:39,154 --> 01:02:43,546
and I let Hwang Taeseop
get his hands dirty instead.

730
01:02:46,565 --> 01:02:49,448
If you try to personally
bring Hwang Jeongyeon down,

731
01:02:49,543 --> 01:02:54,948
you'll have to deal with the repercussions
even if you gain control of the company.

732
01:02:56,931 --> 01:03:00,358
So you need someone to get
his hands dirty on his behalf?

733
01:03:01,787 --> 01:03:04,426
Lee Gangmo is the man for the job.

734
01:03:06,453 --> 01:03:10,602
Let Lee Gangmo bring forth
Hwang Jeongyeon's destruction.

735
01:03:10,713 --> 01:03:17,412
Only then you will forever turn him
into Manbo Construction's enemy.

736
01:03:42,071 --> 01:03:43,502
Yes.

737
01:03:43,988 --> 01:03:46,034
<i>It's me, Jo Minwoo.</i>

738
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:51,265
You're having it quite hard
these days, aren't you?

739
01:03:53,656 --> 01:03:57,621
I just wanted to let you in
on a precious bit of information.

740
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:00,822
Planning to sell trade secrets?

741
01:04:01,194 --> 01:04:03,133
I know what you're scheming.

742
01:04:03,330 --> 01:04:07,391
<i>You want to defeat
Hwang Jeongyeon, don't you?</i>

743
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:10,818
Yourself included.

744
01:04:14,318 --> 01:04:17,971
<i>You should be receiving a fax by now.</i>

745
01:04:24,038 --> 01:04:26,036
<i>You'll have to go through with it 
even if you don't want to.</i>

746
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:28,325
<i>If you want to survive.</i>

747
01:04:29,492 --> 01:04:31,752
<i>I can't wait...</i>

748
01:04:32,305 --> 01:04:38,649
<i>To see how you'll cause
Hwang Jeongyeon's downfall.</i>

749
01:04:58,605 --> 01:05:00,501
Jeongyeon...

756
01:05:17,232 --> 01:05:18,451
<i>Your father has disappeared?!</i>

757
01:05:18,555 --> 01:05:20,410
<i>You were the one who hid him 
at that nursing home.</i>

758
01:05:20,519 --> 01:05:22,360
<i>What did you do to him?</i>

759
01:05:22,454 --> 01:05:25,745
Seems like some higher-up might
be opposing the construction.

760
01:05:25,856 --> 01:05:27,040
It can only be Lee Gangmo.

761
01:05:27,149 --> 01:05:29,799
I'm actually suspecting someone else.

762
01:05:29,959 --> 01:05:32,103
Tell me.
Did you fix his testament?

763
01:05:32,263 --> 01:05:33,612
Did you?

764
01:05:33,780 --> 01:05:35,950
Let's suppose I did.
What are you going to do about it?

765
01:05:36,057 --> 01:05:37,356
<i>What did you just say?</i>

766
01:05:37,461 --> 01:05:39,989
Miju... and Jo Minwoo?!
