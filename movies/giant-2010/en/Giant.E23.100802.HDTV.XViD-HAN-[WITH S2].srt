{\a6}- Episode 23 -

5
00:00:09,425 --> 00:00:14,615
No. 523. 
Change clothes with No. 534.

6
00:00:35,423 --> 00:00:37,305
<i>No. 534.</i>

7
00:00:40,341 --> 00:00:41,555
Yes.

8
00:00:41,721 --> 00:00:45,256
Lee Gangmo will be filed as deceased.

9
00:00:45,481 --> 00:00:50,495
For the rest of your time here, 
you will live as No. 534.

10
00:00:51,086 --> 00:00:53,179
<i>Is that clear?</i>

11
00:01:04,429 --> 00:01:06,938
Dear, Seongmo is here.

12
00:01:07,101 --> 00:01:08,526
Come on in.

13
00:01:08,679 --> 00:01:11,198
Still haven't had breakfast, right?

14
00:01:11,328 --> 00:01:13,327
- Serve breakfast to him as well.
- Yes.

15
00:01:13,457 --> 00:01:15,987
- Have a seat.
- Thank you, Ma'am.

16
00:01:18,447 --> 00:01:20,587
What brings you here so early?

17
00:01:21,042 --> 00:01:24,447
Lee Gangmo passed away.

18
00:01:30,767 --> 00:01:35,995
I just received his death notice 
from camp administration.

19
00:01:39,922 --> 00:01:41,560
Jaechun.

20
00:01:42,493 --> 00:01:43,823
Yes.

21
00:01:50,684 --> 00:01:58,404
This is a will transferring 
possession of Lee Gangmo's land to you.

22
00:02:00,284 --> 00:02:05,527
We already managed to win over his lawyer, 
and complete all notarial acts.

23
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:10,506
Now that Lee Gangmo is dead,
the mudflats in Gaepo are yours.

24
00:02:10,683 --> 00:02:16,007
But everyone will be well aware that
these documents are nothing but a forgery.

25
00:02:16,101 --> 00:02:18,431
And why would we care?

26
00:02:18,971 --> 00:02:23,374
What matters is that you, Minwoo, 
now legally own this land.

27
00:02:23,821 --> 00:02:27,554
Didn't Manbo Construction already
give up on this land, anyway?

28
00:02:27,661 --> 00:02:32,639
Even if these documents are forged,
is there anything they can do to us?

29
00:02:33,644 --> 00:02:35,513
With prospects of marriage 
out of the window,

30
00:02:35,607 --> 00:02:37,523
shouldn't you have something 
like this in your hands,

31
00:02:37,606 --> 00:02:40,813
if you want some 
leverage in this fight?

32
00:02:42,636 --> 00:02:46,657
Once you win the elections,
all our plans will come into fruition.

33
00:02:46,728 --> 00:02:48,620
That's right.

34
00:02:49,529 --> 00:02:52,055
Minwoo gaining control of 
Manbo Construction means...

35
00:02:52,209 --> 00:02:57,554
I won't have to rely on
Hwang Taeseop any longer.

36
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:10,064
<i>Do it properly!</i>

37
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,919
No. 534!

38
00:03:15,097 --> 00:03:17,000
Yes, Sir! No. 534!

39
00:03:17,118 --> 00:03:18,774
Follow me.

40
00:03:28,204 --> 00:03:29,722
Hyung.

41
00:03:32,413 --> 00:03:34,121
Gangmo.

42
00:03:47,726 --> 00:03:49,869
It's been tough, hasn't it?

43
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,287
I can manage.

44
00:04:00,806 --> 00:04:06,825
It feels strange to survive
instead of a fallen fellow inmate.

45
00:04:09,261 --> 00:04:13,892
Jo Pilyeon forged a will to
get his hands on your land.

46
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:17,085
You registered it
under a namesake, right?

47
00:04:17,191 --> 00:04:18,811
No worries.

48
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:23,428
I made sure they'll never
be able to find the owner.

49
00:04:23,524 --> 00:04:25,580
Thanks, Hyung.

50
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:30,984
Once your re-education is over,
you'll go through a final examination.

51
00:04:31,126 --> 00:04:32,805
Some of the inmates will get released,

52
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:38,043
while the rest will complete their
sentence through volunteer community labor.

53
00:04:38,698 --> 00:04:40,573
Hang in there a little longer.

54
00:04:41,163 --> 00:04:43,471
I'll make sure you'll
pass that examination.

55
00:04:43,612 --> 00:04:45,717
No, Hyung, you don't need to.

56
00:04:45,989 --> 00:04:47,798
I'll go through community labor.

57
00:04:47,917 --> 00:04:50,246
Do you realize what awaits you there?

58
00:04:50,424 --> 00:04:52,469
It could be much harder than
anything you've gone through here.

59
00:04:52,576 --> 00:04:54,361
Whatever the case, it doesn't matter.

60
00:04:54,714 --> 00:04:56,620
I'm confident I can endure it.

61
00:04:56,951 --> 00:04:58,347
Gangmo...

62
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:01,659
If I leave now, 
I will never get my name back.

63
00:05:02,014 --> 00:05:08,116
I have all the time to get it back
after the end of my sentence.

64
00:05:08,293 --> 00:05:11,659
Mistakenly reporting my death would
be blamed on the military, anyway.

65
00:05:12,119 --> 00:05:13,965
You just wait, Hyung.

66
00:05:14,913 --> 00:05:21,758
It's as Lee Gangmo, the name my father 
gave me, that I will get my revenge.

67
00:05:22,998 --> 00:05:29,602
For all these years, I was consumed
by my thirst for vengeance.

68
00:05:30,536 --> 00:05:33,575
It made my heart turn into a cold 
machine pumping vitriol in my veins.

69
00:05:35,656 --> 00:05:37,428
If I hadn't met you two,

70
00:05:37,605 --> 00:05:43,068
I would have been
drowning in misery by now.

71
00:05:49,799 --> 00:05:56,828
It pains me to see how I might have
passed that same grief onto you.

72
00:05:57,407 --> 00:06:02,979
I don't know how
this will change me, either.

73
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:06,952
But I am sure of one thing.

74
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:12,522
The fact that you, our Miju and I...

75
00:06:14,059 --> 00:06:17,320
are the most precious
family in this world.

76
00:06:22,842 --> 00:06:24,924
That never...

77
00:06:26,071 --> 00:06:28,560
Never again will I let anyone...

78
00:06:30,464 --> 00:06:33,503
take away my family from me,
just because I'm powerless.

79
00:06:42,788 --> 00:06:44,849
Whatever you do,

80
00:06:46,368 --> 00:06:49,922
I will help you until every bone 
in my body is broken into pieces.

81
00:06:51,081 --> 00:06:53,848
I will devote every day
I have left on this earth...

82
00:06:54,936 --> 00:07:00,316
to give you and Miju everything 
they took away from you.

83
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:04,675
Hyung...

84
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:23,627
You don't need to
bother coming anymore.

85
00:07:23,746 --> 00:07:26,383
I can do that by myself.

86
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:29,304
It's not like it's hard
or anything, Ma'am.

87
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:33,679
When is my Jeongmi coming back?

88
00:07:36,423 --> 00:07:39,713
I told you she had a
concert in the provinces.

89
00:07:39,811 --> 00:07:43,982
Just wait, and she'll make
lots of money and come back to you.

90
00:07:44,135 --> 00:07:46,701
I should just die.

91
00:07:47,305 --> 00:07:50,060
Then my daughter
wouldn't have it so hard...

92
00:07:50,273 --> 00:07:53,442
You should rather hurry up
and get better, for Jeongmi's sake.

93
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:59,832
Do you know what a blessing
being able to call someone "Mom" is?

94
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:02,481
Thank you...

95
00:08:18,929 --> 00:08:21,616
What brings you here?

96
00:08:22,565 --> 00:08:23,963
Ohh...

97
00:08:25,575 --> 00:08:27,983
Someone I know 
was hospitalized here.

98
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:33,115
Just a moment,
I'll go deal with this.

99
00:08:37,337 --> 00:08:38,948
But it sure is peculiar?!

100
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:41,490
How can we just meet here?

101
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:45,357
By any chance...

102
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:48,396
By any chance...
What?

103
00:08:48,649 --> 00:08:50,757
You didn't come for me, did you?

104
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,117
What?!

105
00:08:53,264 --> 00:08:55,416
What are you, crazy?

106
00:08:55,582 --> 00:08:57,524
Why would I?

107
00:08:59,551 --> 00:09:00,477
"Right."

108
00:09:00,596 --> 00:09:04,083
"Now that I think about it,
I feel sad for you."

109
00:09:04,189 --> 00:09:06,211
"So I'll just withdraw the lawsuit."

110
00:09:08,553 --> 00:09:09,818
What are you, daydreaming?

111
00:09:09,913 --> 00:09:12,632
Was just hoping you could say that...

112
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,659
Just close an eye for once, Chief.

113
00:09:18,765 --> 00:09:20,480
Let alone what happened to the master,

114
00:09:20,574 --> 00:09:23,850
Jeongmi is in trouble herself, being
detained at the police station and all.

115
00:09:24,016 --> 00:09:27,102
Don't you ever get angry?

116
00:09:27,256 --> 00:09:28,048
Uh?

117
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:30,765
You couldn't debut
as a singer because of her.

118
00:09:30,883 --> 00:09:33,059
Are you in any position
to worry about her?

119
00:09:33,142 --> 00:09:34,478
Then, what else can I do?

120
00:09:34,549 --> 00:09:36,843
Her mother is ill.

121
00:09:37,716 --> 00:09:40,746
The older I get, the harder
understanding people becomes.

122
00:09:41,272 --> 00:09:45,244
Everyone is struggling to make it 
at someone else's expense,

123
00:09:45,859 --> 00:09:48,011
but there are still gullible 
people like you around.

124
00:09:48,165 --> 00:09:50,092
What are you, making fun of me?

125
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:54,586
So you at least can understand that?
I see not all hope is lost, after all.

126
00:09:56,096 --> 00:10:00,034
I know that's a bad habit
of mine, but what can I do?

127
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:02,564
<i>I lost my mother when I was little,</i>

128
00:10:02,718 --> 00:10:06,266
so what can I do if, every time I witness that,
it feels too close to home to ignore?

129
00:10:08,623 --> 00:10:11,906
I haven't been able to visit
you these days, so I was worried.

130
00:10:12,048 --> 00:10:13,763
<i>I'm glad we met.</i>

131
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:17,251
Promise you will withdraw
the lawsuit before you go.

132
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,498
Go on daydreaming, then.

133
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:25,532
Where are you going?

134
00:10:25,686 --> 00:10:28,571
Hey... You really...

135
00:10:32,293 --> 00:10:34,732
Go take a look at that patient.

136
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:38,676
Do you even know in what
sad state Jeongmi's mother is?

137
00:10:38,795 --> 00:10:44,305
I don't prance around minding 
other people's business like you do.

138
00:10:44,826 --> 00:10:47,997
If you want to deal with this,
then compensate us for the damages.

139
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:57,690
There's no talking to him...

140
00:11:00,421 --> 00:11:02,396
This is serious.

141
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:05,683
It's not like I can continue
looking after her forever.

142
00:11:21,206 --> 00:11:22,720
Come on in.

143
00:11:22,814 --> 00:11:25,007
<i>Here... It's here.</i>

144
00:11:25,181 --> 00:11:26,835
How are you?

145
00:11:29,093 --> 00:11:30,426
How did it go?

146
00:11:30,532 --> 00:11:32,814
Did you find Lee Gangmo?

147
00:11:33,649 --> 00:11:36,232
He's not in our camp.

148
00:11:37,112 --> 00:11:38,940
Look elsewhere.

149
00:11:39,661 --> 00:11:41,214
Wait.

150
00:11:41,421 --> 00:11:43,591
I'll compensate you
with whatever you ask.

151
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:46,606
Look for him just once more.

152
00:11:46,712 --> 00:11:48,451
You won't find him this way.

153
00:11:48,569 --> 00:11:52,696
And even if you do manage to defy 
the odds, they won't let you meet him.

154
00:11:52,968 --> 00:11:54,595
Wait...

155
00:12:06,089 --> 00:12:08,375
I just think...

156
00:12:10,667 --> 00:12:14,170
maybe we should give up 
trying to find Gangmo.

157
00:12:23,866 --> 00:12:25,949
Jeongyeon is here.

158
00:12:29,768 --> 00:12:32,169
- I'm back.
- Agasshi, you're back?

159
00:12:32,347 --> 00:12:34,877
Aigoo... You haven't
had dinner, right?

160
00:12:34,971 --> 00:12:36,461
I'll prepare it for you right away.

161
00:12:36,532 --> 00:12:37,644
I have no appetite.

162
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:41,771
Where are you going around 
all day, missing work?

163
00:12:41,913 --> 00:12:43,497
I took a few days off.

164
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:46,134
You still go around
looking for Gangmo?

165
00:12:46,371 --> 00:12:49,383
<i>Aigoo... How touching.</i>

166
00:12:49,465 --> 00:12:52,008
Ohh Ohh... Keep it up...

167
00:12:54,753 --> 00:12:59,363
They said the Samcheong camp 
will end in four weeks.

168
00:12:59,505 --> 00:13:04,049
There isn't much time left, 
so just wait patiently.

169
00:13:04,262 --> 00:13:04,983
<i>Right!</i>

170
00:13:05,054 --> 00:13:08,684
Today a letter from Gangmo 
came in the mail?

171
00:13:08,782 --> 00:13:09,536
What?

172
00:13:09,654 --> 00:13:12,137
Aigoo... Why are you only
saying that now, you ajumma!

173
00:13:12,232 --> 00:13:15,443
I forgot, what else?

174
00:13:15,656 --> 00:13:17,193
<i>Where did I put it again...</i>

175
00:13:17,347 --> 00:13:19,620
<i>Ahh! Right.</i>

176
00:13:28,613 --> 00:13:30,103
<i>- Death Notice -</i>

177
00:13:30,214 --> 00:13:32,450
<i>- Subject -
Decease of Lee Gangmo</i>

178
00:13:36,078 --> 00:13:38,670
<i>- We extend you
our sincerest condolences -</i>

179
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:46,231
What is it saying?

180
00:13:48,359 --> 00:13:49,956
What is this...

181
00:13:50,991 --> 00:13:53,113
Gangmo is dead?!

182
00:13:53,721 --> 00:13:55,535
<i>D...Dead?!</i>

183
00:13:55,653 --> 00:13:58,503
Gangmo... has died?!

184
00:13:58,574 --> 00:14:00,300
Give it here.

185
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:03,221
That's right...

186
00:14:03,398 --> 00:14:07,637
It's a notice from the camp
announcing his death.

187
00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:16,117
- Agasshi!
- Jeongyeon!

188
00:14:16,194 --> 00:14:18,350
Jeongyeon... Jeongyeon!

189
00:14:19,304 --> 00:14:21,221
Jeongyeon!

190
00:14:31,763 --> 00:14:36,494
I should have done something.

191
00:14:37,144 --> 00:14:42,358
I shouldn't have allowed them 
to arrest him that way...

192
00:14:42,495 --> 00:14:44,795
Gangmo is not dead.

193
00:14:47,049 --> 00:14:51,374
There is no way he died.

194
00:14:52,542 --> 00:14:53,364
Jeongyeon...

195
00:14:53,482 --> 00:14:59,738
I've heard sometimes the military makes 
mistakes sending out those notices.

196
00:15:02,135 --> 00:15:04,587
He didn't die, Gangmo.

197
00:15:07,501 --> 00:15:11,351
He would never die that way.

198
00:15:17,393 --> 00:15:19,305
No. 534.

199
00:15:19,506 --> 00:15:22,983
So your hometown is Gwangju 
in Jeolla Province?

200
00:15:25,131 --> 00:15:26,613
Yes.

201
00:15:30,184 --> 00:15:31,840
<i>Here...</i>

202
00:15:38,488 --> 00:15:42,273
<i>- Park Chungkwon -</i>

203
00:15:59,512 --> 00:16:01,361
Where is Gangmo?

204
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:03,289
Lee Gangmo didn't die, right?

205
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:06,412
You made some kind of mistake.

206
00:16:26,702 --> 00:16:28,689
He had no family,

207
00:16:29,044 --> 00:16:32,344
so we took the liberty 
of cremating him.

208
00:16:32,451 --> 00:16:34,236
No way...

209
00:16:35,626 --> 00:16:37,784
It's not Gangmo.

210
00:16:39,729 --> 00:16:42,218
It can't possibly be him.

211
00:16:44,164 --> 00:16:45,928
Gangmo...

212
00:16:47,895 --> 00:16:50,057
is not dead.

213
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,380
I can confirm it's Lee Gangmo.

214
00:16:55,506 --> 00:16:57,469
Gangmo...

215
00:16:59,403 --> 00:17:01,422
Gangmo!

216
00:17:01,647 --> 00:17:04,331
Gangmo!

217
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:10,253
<i>Gangmo!
What happened to you?</i>

218
00:17:11,979 --> 00:17:13,628
<i>Gangmo...</i>

219
00:17:13,744 --> 00:17:17,986
<i>Gangmo! Gangmo...</i>

220
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:34,583
Jeongyeon.

221
00:17:34,867 --> 00:17:37,892
It's heavy, so give it to me.

222
00:17:37,999 --> 00:17:40,139
Don't touch it.

223
00:17:42,835 --> 00:17:44,845
Nobody...

224
00:17:46,735 --> 00:17:51,894
Nobody can touch Gangmo.

225
00:17:53,431 --> 00:17:55,584
<i>Gangmo...</i>

226
00:17:57,372 --> 00:17:59,569
Gangmo...

227
00:18:02,802 --> 00:18:05,502
Gangmo...

228
00:18:08,683 --> 00:18:12,503
Gangmo...

229
00:19:29,886 --> 00:19:31,677
Sit down.

230
00:19:35,812 --> 00:19:40,424
For the time being,
take some time off,

231
00:19:40,819 --> 00:19:42,766
and have a good rest.

232
00:19:43,972 --> 00:19:46,207
<i>All right, Jeongyeon?</i>

233
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:53,056
This was Gangmo's.

234
00:20:00,388 --> 00:20:02,126
Let's leave her alone.

235
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:12,184
<i>- Will you marry me? -</i>

236
00:21:15,557 --> 00:21:17,627
<i>It will be hard to bear.</i>

237
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:23,389
We can't possibly predict
what difficulties we'll be facing.

238
00:21:24,194 --> 00:21:26,133
But you still...

239
00:21:27,267 --> 00:21:29,704
You'll have to give everything up.

240
00:21:30,969 --> 00:21:32,625
Your dreams...

241
00:21:32,779 --> 00:21:34,796
Your family.

242
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:37,586
Maybe even the life you're living now.

243
00:21:37,717 --> 00:21:39,833
I'll come.

244
00:21:41,046 --> 00:21:43,499
Together with you.

245
00:21:45,477 --> 00:21:48,454
Wherever it might be,
it doesn't matter.

246
00:23:26,902 --> 00:23:27,767
Agasshi!

247
00:23:27,862 --> 00:23:30,144
What's the matter?

248
00:23:31,096 --> 00:23:32,562
What's wrong?

249
00:23:32,657 --> 00:23:35,258
Agasshi, get a hold of yourself!

250
00:23:35,535 --> 00:23:38,097
Agasshi... Agasshi!

251
00:23:38,747 --> 00:23:40,466
<i>Agasshi!</i>

252
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,389
Help!

253
00:23:42,543 --> 00:23:43,933
<i>Agasshi!</i>

254
00:23:44,015 --> 00:23:45,884
<i>Aigoo... What now?</i>

255
00:23:45,967 --> 00:23:47,551
<i>Agasshi!</i>

256
00:23:52,253 --> 00:23:55,108
What happened, Seonsaengnim?

257
00:23:55,297 --> 00:23:58,936
It looks like the psychological
trauma caused a state of aphasia.

258
00:23:59,098 --> 00:24:01,428
Aphasia?!

259
00:24:01,546 --> 00:24:03,722
<i>You mean she lost the ability to speak?</i>

260
00:24:03,828 --> 00:24:06,465
In her current state, 
she might not even be able to hear.

261
00:24:06,584 --> 00:24:09,791
<i>Her symptoms resemble 
those of a stroke.</i>

262
00:24:10,005 --> 00:24:13,807
Then... What will happen to her?

263
00:24:14,107 --> 00:24:17,994
Will she be forced to live in that
state for the rest of her life?

264
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:22,026
It's a case by case scenario,
but some even return to normal in a day.

265
00:24:22,156 --> 00:24:27,521
So it might be a very long recovery?

266
00:24:27,947 --> 00:24:28,798
Yes.

267
00:24:28,916 --> 00:24:31,447
Some patients even take
several years to recover.

268
00:24:34,693 --> 00:24:38,974
<i>But for now it's best to stabilize
her condition and keep watching her.</i>

269
00:24:42,472 --> 00:24:46,291
What on earth is all this?

270
00:24:47,568 --> 00:24:50,075
Jeongyeon has aphasia?!

271
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,137
Jeongyeon.

272
00:26:11,844 --> 00:26:14,255
Was it this serious?

273
00:26:17,337 --> 00:26:20,222
Enough for you to
lose the ability to speak,

274
00:26:22,544 --> 00:26:25,815
did you love Lee Gangmo that much?

275
00:26:29,408 --> 00:26:37,629
I shouldn't have gotten
involved from the very start.

276
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:47,999
My love for you paled in
comparison from the beginning.

277
00:26:57,956 --> 00:27:00,078
I'm sorry, Jeongyeon.

278
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,306
I...

279
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:07,214
I found out...

280
00:27:10,764 --> 00:27:13,635
I found out your 
true feelings too late.

281
00:27:33,296 --> 00:27:35,506
Quick, step out!

282
00:27:35,565 --> 00:27:37,386
Let's hurry up, quick.

283
00:27:37,493 --> 00:27:39,680
<i>Everyone who needs to step out, quick!</i>

284
00:27:39,881 --> 00:27:42,433
Quick, come in.

285
00:27:42,667 --> 00:27:44,292
<i>Your token.</i>

286
00:27:45,309 --> 00:27:48,138
If no one else's coming in, all right!

287
00:28:00,294 --> 00:28:02,421
Here... Step out!

288
00:28:02,503 --> 00:28:05,507
Your token... Thank you.

289
00:28:05,578 --> 00:28:08,664
Here you go. Thank you.

290
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:11,360
Hurry up.

291
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,934
Everything clear... All right!

292
00:28:24,053 --> 00:28:26,051
Are you taking the bus?

293
00:28:26,441 --> 00:28:29,906
Or else, it's "all right."

294
00:28:36,487 --> 00:28:38,030
All right!

295
00:28:46,618 --> 00:28:51,369
But your office is the opposite way, 
where are you going?

296
00:28:52,859 --> 00:28:53,928
No idea.

297
00:28:54,021 --> 00:28:55,351
You don't know?

298
00:28:55,576 --> 00:28:57,787
So why did you take the bus?

299
00:28:57,941 --> 00:29:00,791
I'm asking myself the same question.

300
00:29:05,177 --> 00:29:08,384
There are plenty of empty seats
over there, why don't you sit?

301
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:09,732
It'll crease up my pants.

302
00:29:09,827 --> 00:29:11,660
And those seats are way too dirty.

303
00:29:12,698 --> 00:29:15,609
So why even bother riding the bus...

304
00:29:20,044 --> 00:29:21,702
Something bad happened...

305
00:29:21,785 --> 00:29:23,428
Right?

306
00:29:26,955 --> 00:29:28,229
Why?

307
00:29:28,442 --> 00:29:31,115
- Is it written all over me?
- A little.

308
00:29:31,197 --> 00:29:34,714
How should I put it,
that you look a little sad?

309
00:29:36,666 --> 00:29:39,349
When do you get off work?

310
00:29:40,788 --> 00:29:42,613
Why are you asking?

311
00:29:44,552 --> 00:29:47,849
By any chance, 
want to withdraw the lawsuit?

312
00:29:47,955 --> 00:29:51,724
If I do that,
what will you do for me?

313
00:29:58,858 --> 00:30:00,822
<i>Here.</i>

314
00:30:01,946 --> 00:30:03,414
What's this?

315
00:30:03,662 --> 00:30:04,750
Gum, can't you see?

316
00:30:04,821 --> 00:30:06,595
Chew it.

317
00:30:09,435 --> 00:30:10,934
Never mind...

318
00:30:11,869 --> 00:30:14,708
Who am I kidding,
expecting anything from you...

319
00:30:14,874 --> 00:30:16,742
You don't have a clue, do you?

320
00:30:16,908 --> 00:30:23,400
When you feel down, nothing beats chewing 
gum while riding the bus around town.

321
00:30:26,812 --> 00:30:29,224
<i>I said chew it.</i>

322
00:30:38,342 --> 00:30:41,606
The bus is always half-empty 
around this time.

323
00:30:41,783 --> 00:30:45,839
I won't ask you for any tickets,
so come anytime.

324
00:30:47,931 --> 00:30:50,782
Don't feel burdened.

325
00:30:51,705 --> 00:30:53,263
Hey.

326
00:30:53,807 --> 00:30:58,111
So, what, you want to exchange a few 
tickets and chewing gum with a lawsuit?

327
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:02,049
You really seem to think I'm a...

328
00:31:05,609 --> 00:31:09,852
<i>Who left a goddamned mutt 
lying on the street? Ehh...</i>

329
00:31:11,757 --> 00:31:13,802
I'm sorry.

330
00:31:13,873 --> 00:31:15,682
I didn't spill anything on it, I hope?

331
00:31:15,777 --> 00:31:17,515
It's all right.

332
00:31:53,888 --> 00:31:55,130
Big Oppa...

333
00:31:55,296 --> 00:31:57,448
Miju, you're back?

334
00:31:57,625 --> 00:31:58,909
What?!

335
00:31:58,991 --> 00:32:00,659
Did you just cook me dinner?

336
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:02,504
Hungry, uh? Let's eat.

337
00:32:02,575 --> 00:32:04,407
Follow me.

338
00:32:06,039 --> 00:32:08,913
<i>Here... Let's eat.</i>

339
00:32:10,439 --> 00:32:12,522
Here... Miju.

340
00:32:13,239 --> 00:32:15,368
You always liked 
seasoned beans, right?

341
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:17,390
I boiled some in soy sauce.

342
00:32:17,449 --> 00:32:19,814
Try them out... here...

343
00:32:23,716 --> 00:32:24,809
They're good.

344
00:32:24,916 --> 00:32:27,924
They taste just like the ones 
Mom used to cook for us.

345
00:32:28,425 --> 00:32:30,159
Try the stew as well.

346
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:34,073
Here we have boiled beef,
and fried eggs.

347
00:32:36,505 --> 00:32:37,562
By the way...

348
00:32:37,656 --> 00:32:40,324
Can't you take off that apron?

349
00:32:40,786 --> 00:32:43,352
Why... Looks strange?

350
00:32:43,505 --> 00:32:46,497
Ahh... Was afraid
something would spill.

351
00:32:54,773 --> 00:32:56,234
What is it?

352
00:32:56,825 --> 00:32:58,244
Does it taste strange?

353
00:32:58,327 --> 00:33:00,042
Is it bad?

354
00:33:01,969 --> 00:33:07,272
Gangmo Oppa cooked
for me on my birthday, too.

355
00:33:09,773 --> 00:33:13,670
I was so sad without you, that day.

356
00:33:14,178 --> 00:33:19,662
Now you're here, 
but Gangmo is not with us.

357
00:33:20,154 --> 00:33:21,459
Miju.

358
00:33:21,684 --> 00:33:24,924
When will we all eat together?

359
00:33:26,286 --> 00:33:29,926
Gangmo will soon be out.

360
00:33:30,162 --> 00:33:32,205
How "soon" can that be?

361
00:33:32,311 --> 00:33:35,670
He's still a long way
from coming home.

362
00:33:35,812 --> 00:33:39,612
I'll get him out of there soon.

363
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:40,873
Really?

364
00:33:40,991 --> 00:33:42,244
Sure.

365
00:33:42,339 --> 00:33:44,619
I don't lie to my Miju.

366
00:33:44,796 --> 00:33:49,441
We will soon be able to eat
all together, the three of us.

367
00:33:50,481 --> 00:33:52,480
Oppa...

368
00:33:53,248 --> 00:33:56,583
Let's eat, it'll get cold.

369
00:33:57,352 --> 00:33:58,883
Yeah.

370
00:34:36,718 --> 00:34:39,915
You look like you
were born to shovel?!

371
00:34:40,045 --> 00:34:43,580
Keep it up and your bones
will wear out. Take it easy.

372
00:34:43,699 --> 00:34:46,513
It's not like they're
paying us for this.

373
00:34:46,643 --> 00:34:50,687
Can't we just fill in the strict
necessary and get the hell out?

374
00:34:51,277 --> 00:34:53,288
<i>Ahh... Wretched fool.</i>

375
00:34:53,394 --> 00:34:56,622
Did they stick your
tongue down your ears?

376
00:34:56,717 --> 00:35:00,868
If one talks to you, 
have the courtesy to say something.

377
00:35:03,707 --> 00:35:05,647
Say what?! A fortnight?

378
00:35:05,777 --> 00:35:08,094
Are you telling me it'll take
two weeks to build that road?

379
00:35:08,165 --> 00:35:10,424
It's a mountainous area,
so it's filled with rocks...

380
00:35:10,542 --> 00:35:14,090
You want to see heads 
rolling around here?

381
00:35:14,161 --> 00:35:15,982
I take that back, Sir!

382
00:35:16,136 --> 00:35:19,754
Whatever the case,
get that road done in a week.

383
00:35:19,861 --> 00:35:23,586
If you don't make it by then,
prepare to hang up your boots.

384
00:35:23,669 --> 00:35:24,804
Is that clear?

385
00:35:24,958 --> 00:35:26,909
Red hunt!

386
00:35:30,782 --> 00:35:32,291
I'll be damned.

387
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:35,354
We are forced to 
leave all this to No. 471.

388
00:35:36,005 --> 00:35:38,098
- No. 471?!
- Yes.

389
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:40,557
He's made a name for himself
around construction sites.

390
00:35:40,687 --> 00:35:42,949
Where is he now?

391
00:35:51,596 --> 00:35:55,868
Always prancing around together like
a bunch of beggars, aren't they?!

392
00:35:57,315 --> 00:35:59,042
No. 471.

393
00:35:59,231 --> 00:36:01,903
Hey... No. 471!

394
00:36:04,351 --> 00:36:06,231
Did... Did you just call me?

395
00:36:06,302 --> 00:36:10,063
If we leave the construction to you, 
how long will it take you?

396
00:36:10,146 --> 00:36:12,329
What are you talking about, 
all of a sudden?

397
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,043
The division commander
will pass by this road in a week.

398
00:36:16,208 --> 00:36:19,768
<i>So you're telling me you need to 
finish this road within the week?</i>

399
00:36:19,874 --> 00:36:22,368
Or it's a quick trip to 
detention camp for all of us.

400
00:36:22,477 --> 00:36:23,738
Help us out just this once.

401
00:36:23,809 --> 00:36:29,994
What is this, a rug? You can't 
just roll it and get it over with.

402
00:36:30,112 --> 00:36:32,004
I've heard you have no peers
when it comes to construction.

403
00:36:32,134 --> 00:36:37,200
I'll give you a very simple
estimate, so you can understand.

404
00:36:37,319 --> 00:36:41,907
Here... First, just digging and 
hardening the soil will take four days.

405
00:36:42,025 --> 00:36:46,365
Uh? Add to that another
three days for the cement.

406
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:48,387
Your week is already
gone by, just for that.

407
00:36:48,458 --> 00:36:51,345
<i>And tell me, is concrete ready
the moment you're done applying it?</i>

408
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:54,904
It'll take another good four-five
days for that to be ready.

409
00:36:55,022 --> 00:36:59,894
So that's four plus three,
and if you add another five, how much...

410
00:37:00,024 --> 00:37:04,112
There is no way in hell you
can get that done in a week.

411
00:37:04,195 --> 00:37:05,649
Think we don't know that?

412
00:37:05,708 --> 00:37:07,494
Aigoo, then, what
am I supposed to do?

413
00:37:07,577 --> 00:37:09,268
If it can't be done, be honest.

414
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:13,206
Why say you can make it and 
then have to piss blood after?

415
00:37:13,371 --> 00:37:15,677
Starting now,
you're working day and night.

416
00:37:15,819 --> 00:37:17,659
<i>We must end this all 
by the end of the week!</i>

417
00:37:17,789 --> 00:37:20,599
We will not tolerate any laziness!

418
00:37:20,699 --> 00:37:22,389
Proceed!

419
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:26,847
Hurry up and keep working, 
you useless twats!

420
00:37:36,025 --> 00:37:36,699
<i>Next.</i>

421
00:37:36,758 --> 00:37:38,969
<i>Ahh... Is this all?</i>

422
00:37:40,152 --> 00:37:43,489
- Give me more!
- Go, you prick.

423
00:37:55,149 --> 00:37:57,191
I've heard about you.

424
00:37:57,534 --> 00:38:01,093
So you're famous
around construction sites?

425
00:38:01,259 --> 00:38:03,896
Who... Me?

426
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:06,013
I used to be.

427
00:38:08,437 --> 00:38:11,040
Only with a hammer in hand,

428
00:38:11,146 --> 00:38:17,036
I can tell you how many reinforcing rods,
and even the cement and sand proportions...

429
00:38:17,127 --> 00:38:18,273
they used to build a pillar.

430
00:38:18,355 --> 00:38:21,454
We can finish this construction 
in a week, can we?

431
00:38:23,462 --> 00:38:28,438
In my estimation, we can 
harden the soil in three days.

432
00:38:29,604 --> 00:38:31,229
And we can lay 
the cement in two days.

433
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:33,275
You're something?!

434
00:38:33,476 --> 00:38:36,639
But how about 
drying out the cement?

435
00:38:36,876 --> 00:38:40,092
Will you stand there with fans 
hoping it'll dry faster?

436
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:42,102
It takes at least four-five days.

437
00:38:42,221 --> 00:38:44,562
And if it starts raining
even once, you're screwed.

438
00:38:44,668 --> 00:38:48,240
If you can make it on time,
take over this construction.

439
00:38:48,689 --> 00:38:51,234
Or by next week 
we'll all be screwed.

440
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:57,859
Why, think if we finish this on time,
they'll leave us in peace?

441
00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:00,635
Sure... You saw right.

442
00:39:00,729 --> 00:39:05,580
I can certainly complete
this road within a week.

443
00:39:05,888 --> 00:39:08,690
But what am I, crazy?

444
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:12,727
Why should I help out people 
who beat me up all day?

445
00:39:14,094 --> 00:39:17,642
Just a month and I'm out of here.

446
00:39:31,013 --> 00:39:33,319
Let's hurry up!

447
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:36,985
Get up!

448
00:39:41,745 --> 00:39:44,725
<i>I said hurry up, you fool!</i>

449
00:39:55,297 --> 00:39:57,390
Get moving!

450
00:39:57,496 --> 00:39:59,708
Hurry up!

451
00:39:59,778 --> 00:40:01,741
Are these all the
reinforcements you could get?

452
00:40:01,812 --> 00:40:03,704
More are coming 
from other battalions.

453
00:40:03,787 --> 00:40:05,530
What's with him?

454
00:40:05,774 --> 00:40:07,843
<i>Come down.</i>

455
00:40:09,639 --> 00:40:10,857
<i>What the hell?</i>

456
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:13,116
<i>Get up, you fool!</i>

457
00:40:17,716 --> 00:40:19,655
Let's go.

458
00:40:38,793 --> 00:40:40,971
G...Gangmo!

459
00:40:49,235 --> 00:40:51,834
Hurry up and go!

460
00:40:52,735 --> 00:40:56,495
<i>I said go, you prick!</i>

461
00:41:01,001 --> 00:41:03,670
Do you know him?

462
00:41:04,065 --> 00:41:07,081
<i>Why send us such damaged goods?</i>

463
00:41:07,163 --> 00:41:12,343
<i>People like him 
can only be a hindrance.</i>

464
00:41:13,064 --> 00:41:14,235
How can you do it?

465
00:41:14,353 --> 00:41:16,467
What? Fix damaged goods?

466
00:41:16,538 --> 00:41:18,738
How can concrete dry out faster?

467
00:41:18,868 --> 00:41:21,883
Look at him... Asking the 
magician to tell you his tricks?

468
00:41:21,966 --> 00:41:24,461
Can't you see everyone is suffering?

469
00:41:24,709 --> 00:41:27,879
If someone ends up dead,
will you take responsibility?

470
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:35,322
If you really want 
to end this quickly,

471
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:38,605
then find a way yourself.

472
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:42,440
Want me to give you a hint?

473
00:41:42,842 --> 00:41:45,385
You can find it all around us?!

474
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:47,182
Take that and use it wisely.

475
00:41:47,277 --> 00:41:52,468
Then you can finish 
this all in a week.

476
00:41:52,716 --> 00:41:56,698
But if you do find out what that is,

477
00:41:56,876 --> 00:42:00,151
that'd make you a genius, 
nothing but.

478
00:42:01,168 --> 00:42:05,768
But tell me, would a genius go
through hell in a place like this?

479
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:08,243
I mean, a genius?!

480
00:42:13,553 --> 00:42:16,592
How is the apartment sale proceeding?

481
00:42:16,758 --> 00:42:19,779
Your strategy was right on.

482
00:42:19,921 --> 00:42:22,712
After we got famous movie
stars and singers involved,

483
00:42:22,795 --> 00:42:25,408
requests are raining down
on us from everywhere.

484
00:42:25,789 --> 00:42:30,593
Widen our spectrum by adding sports 
stars and politicians to the mix.

485
00:42:30,699 --> 00:42:32,964
We must build a strong
image for our apartments,

486
00:42:33,082 --> 00:42:35,375
as the kind of luxury residences
that win over many celebrities' favor.

487
00:42:35,434 --> 00:42:36,570
All right.

488
00:42:36,771 --> 00:42:39,109
Chief.

489
00:42:39,479 --> 00:42:44,056
But regarding the
record company's lawsuit?

490
00:42:44,671 --> 00:42:46,953
I'm sure I told you to withdraw it?!

491
00:42:47,059 --> 00:42:50,773
We did withdraw it 
as you instructed us,

492
00:42:50,959 --> 00:42:53,019
but should the board
of executives find out...

493
00:42:53,114 --> 00:42:54,675
No need to worry.

494
00:42:55,006 --> 00:42:57,639
If we succeed with this
apartment sale as planned,

495
00:42:57,769 --> 00:42:59,851
then I will convince the board.

496
00:43:01,163 --> 00:43:03,571
Let's conclude today's meeting.

497
00:43:08,192 --> 00:43:10,419
<i>Ohh! Chief!</i>

498
00:43:16,305 --> 00:43:17,306
I'm busy.

499
00:43:17,436 --> 00:43:19,600
If you have anything
to say, do it quickly.

500
00:43:21,478 --> 00:43:23,548
Didn't you hear I'm busy?

501
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,552
If you've got nothing to say...

502
00:43:26,623 --> 00:43:29,023
Thank you, Chief!

503
00:43:29,295 --> 00:43:31,357
Hey... What's wrong with you?

504
00:43:31,773 --> 00:43:34,794
You saved us all, Chief.

505
00:43:34,888 --> 00:43:40,089
Everyone including
Jeongmi and her mother.

506
00:43:45,272 --> 00:43:47,527
I only did it because
I've had it with you!

507
00:43:47,705 --> 00:43:50,325
You stick to people like
a damned chewing gum!

508
00:43:50,444 --> 00:43:54,618
I'll never forget what you did for us.

509
00:43:54,772 --> 00:43:56,770
I can bring you 
a lunchbox every day, and...

510
00:43:56,865 --> 00:43:59,762
<i>Didn't you hear that
I've had it with you?</i>

511
00:44:01,712 --> 00:44:04,001
As if they were any good...

512
00:44:04,119 --> 00:44:06,058
Get out of the way.

513
00:44:07,169 --> 00:44:08,908
Thank you, Chief.

514
00:44:09,026 --> 00:44:11,616
Chief, you're the best!

515
00:44:14,431 --> 00:44:16,012
The best.

516
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:40,710
Jaechun.

517
00:44:40,817 --> 00:44:42,648
How does this necktie look?

518
00:44:42,766 --> 00:44:44,753
Is it a bit flashy?

519
00:44:44,836 --> 00:44:47,465
It looks great to me, Ma'am.

520
00:44:47,875 --> 00:44:48,844
Give me another one.

521
00:44:48,939 --> 00:44:51,375
It doesn't suit my image of a
candidate for the working class.

522
00:44:51,481 --> 00:44:53,894
Ahh... That's right.

523
00:44:54,095 --> 00:44:55,983
Then, how about this one?

524
00:44:56,161 --> 00:44:58,727
Yeah... That one would be fine.

525
00:45:00,169 --> 00:45:01,718
Mister Gong, you said?

526
00:45:01,837 --> 00:45:05,288
How about that informer who
will reveal Min Honggi's past?

527
00:45:05,377 --> 00:45:09,117
Seongmo will take him 
to the speech himself.

528
00:45:09,837 --> 00:45:13,461
We'll finally start seeing
some fireworks today.

529
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:18,263
This will be Min Honggi's
very last stumping session.

530
00:45:22,585 --> 00:45:25,744
Are we still far?

531
00:45:25,981 --> 00:45:27,317
We're almost there.

532
00:45:27,459 --> 00:45:30,257
We will soon reach
the campaign platform.

533
00:45:30,392 --> 00:45:32,875
<i>{\a6}*Colonial-era independence activist</i>

534
00:45:30,392 --> 00:45:32,875
You remember Yoon Bonggil*?

535
00:45:32,993 --> 00:45:37,005
Yes, I deeply respect what he did.

536
00:45:37,727 --> 00:45:42,977
You will become 
today's Yoon Bonggil.

537
00:45:43,923 --> 00:45:45,709
But, unlike him,

538
00:45:45,827 --> 00:45:49,901
you must not let yourself be captured 
after setting up that bombshell.

539
00:45:50,090 --> 00:45:55,908
When you reveal the truth to everyone, 
that place will fall into chaos.

540
00:45:56,098 --> 00:45:59,976
He will help you get out of there.

541
00:46:01,563 --> 00:46:03,680
<i>You must never,</i>

542
00:46:05,467 --> 00:46:08,564
ever let Jo Pilyeon 
get his hands on you.

543
00:46:08,966 --> 00:46:12,584
Yes... I understand.

544
00:46:41,797 --> 00:46:47,662
It is with hard work and
dedication that we have achieved...

545
00:46:47,804 --> 00:46:50,820
this miraculous 
economic development.

546
00:46:51,033 --> 00:46:57,209
All that remains for us is becoming
a developed nation like Japan or America.

547
00:46:57,327 --> 00:47:04,209
And do you know what's the most urgent
step to take to make sure that happens?

548
00:47:04,505 --> 00:47:10,383
That is security!
Bringing security to our nation!

549
00:47:11,442 --> 00:47:15,291
Ladies and gentlemen,
take a look at those demonstrators,

550
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:18,507
parading the streets every day.

551
00:47:18,862 --> 00:47:24,371
The commies have infiltrated
the very fabric of our society!

552
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:27,588
<i>And to cope with these
daunting threats of war,</i>

553
00:47:27,707 --> 00:47:34,779
<i>what our people need is a stronger 
and more powerful government!</i>

554
00:47:34,932 --> 00:47:37,628
If that is the 
government you wish for,

555
00:47:37,723 --> 00:47:44,333
you must cast your vote and
choose Candidate No. 1, Min Honggi!

556
00:47:44,392 --> 00:47:48,222
Well said!

557
00:47:48,332 --> 00:47:51,255
Min Honggi! Min Honggi!

558
00:47:51,350 --> 00:47:56,021
Min Honggi! Min Honggi!

559
00:47:57,369 --> 00:48:00,349
Look at those gangsters...

560
00:48:06,524 --> 00:48:09,438
Jo Pilyeon! Jo Pilyeon!

561
00:48:09,615 --> 00:48:17,070
Jo Pilyeon! Jo Pilyeon!

562
00:48:35,546 --> 00:48:42,326
My colleague Min Honggi spoke of 
the rosy future which awaits us all.

563
00:48:42,468 --> 00:48:45,578
<i>It was a remarkable speech, indeed.</i>

564
00:48:45,838 --> 00:48:50,320
However, while our future is full of hope,

565
00:48:50,450 --> 00:48:53,767
our present is still mired in poverty.

566
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:57,977
Do you have money to
spare at home, by any chance?

567
00:48:58,166 --> 00:49:01,749
The price of land in Gangnam 
is skyrocketing,

568
00:49:01,844 --> 00:49:04,341
did you by any chance buy any of it?

569
00:49:04,448 --> 00:49:05,900
No!

570
00:49:06,621 --> 00:49:08,185
Of course not.

571
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:11,473
<i>We still remain poor.</i>

572
00:49:11,721 --> 00:49:15,257
<i>The rich become richer by the day,</i>

573
00:49:15,399 --> 00:49:18,686
but your hunger 
only seems to get worse.

574
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:22,776
What kind of situation is this?

575
00:49:24,341 --> 00:49:26,016
<i>In this country,</i>

576
00:49:26,182 --> 00:49:30,238
it is more likely a camel will 
pass through the eye of a needle...

577
00:49:30,321 --> 00:49:32,698
than to see a poor man become rich.

578
00:49:32,851 --> 00:49:37,177
And that is because our problems
start at the very root of it all.

579
00:49:37,898 --> 00:49:40,240
Take a look around you.

580
00:49:40,677 --> 00:49:45,109
The people who enjoyed a life of
luxury during the colonial period...

581
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:49,277
still continue their frivolous
excesses and keep becoming richer.

582
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:52,549
And at the very root of this evil
cancer afflicting our society...

583
00:49:52,667 --> 00:49:56,077
is the fact we couldn't do away 
with that terrible legacy.

584
00:49:58,101 --> 00:50:00,830
On the pretext of being 
a passionate patriot,

585
00:50:00,937 --> 00:50:07,500
one of this election's candidates
is hiding his pro-Japanese ancestry!

586
00:50:10,775 --> 00:50:14,958
<i>You deserve to know the truth.</i>

587
00:50:15,088 --> 00:50:18,567
I, Candidate No. 4 Jo Pilyeon,

588
00:50:18,662 --> 00:50:22,233
have brought someone
who can enlighten you all...

589
00:50:22,777 --> 00:50:25,248
on this despicable facade.

590
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:28,961
Gong Seonsaengnim.

591
00:50:29,174 --> 00:50:31,313
Will you please come to the stage?

592
00:50:45,152 --> 00:50:47,182
You may speak.

593
00:50:50,295 --> 00:50:52,054
Everyone.

594
00:50:52,515 --> 00:51:02,096
My father passed away in prison after
participating in the independence movement.

595
00:51:02,746 --> 00:51:10,345
One of these candidates is the son of 
the ruthless pro-Japanese collaborator...

596
00:51:10,575 --> 00:51:14,384
who caused my father's death.

597
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:20,261
<i>Folks!</i>

598
00:51:20,426 --> 00:51:25,944
I have all the evidence here!

599
00:51:28,664 --> 00:51:35,452
The boy next to the
pro-Japanese officer in this photo...

600
00:51:35,617 --> 00:51:39,205
is right here among us!

601
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:43,355
<i>His father's name...</i>

602
00:51:43,509 --> 00:51:45,709
<i>is Jo Mangeun,</i>

603
00:51:45,850 --> 00:51:47,849
while his son...

604
00:51:47,943 --> 00:51:50,653
is Jo Pilyeon!

605
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:53,079
<i>Everyone!</i>

606
00:51:56,851 --> 00:51:59,276
What is he talking about?

607
00:52:02,184 --> 00:52:07,537
Many patriots who fought for our
future died at the hands of Jo Mangeun!

608
00:52:07,667 --> 00:52:11,498
Jo Pilyeon cannot be elected!

609
00:52:11,581 --> 00:52:16,192
You cannot let this happen!

610
00:52:20,671 --> 00:52:23,536
Minwoo, do something!

611
00:52:32,356 --> 00:52:34,051
Are you all right?

612
00:52:34,212 --> 00:52:38,150
Catch him... That informer!
You must catch him at all cost!

613
00:52:38,233 --> 00:52:40,031
All right.

614
00:53:03,465 --> 00:53:10,653
Who could imagine someone bearing a 
grudge against Jo Pilyeon would appear?!

615
00:53:10,785 --> 00:53:13,848
The way I see it,
it was no coincidence.

616
00:53:14,013 --> 00:53:17,939
Candidate Min,
do we owe you the honor?

617
00:53:18,779 --> 00:53:21,613
With your keen eye, there is 
nothing I could hide from you.

618
00:53:21,731 --> 00:53:22,713
What?!

619
00:53:22,855 --> 00:53:25,610
So it was all a ruse?

620
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:28,909
There is no such thing
as a ruse in politics.

621
00:53:29,016 --> 00:53:31,191
Let's just call it strategy.

622
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:36,381
The elections are as good as over, 
considering this scandal.

623
00:53:36,535 --> 00:53:40,217
If all the morning papers cover this,

624
00:53:40,443 --> 00:53:43,228
then there's no more hope 
for Candidate Jo.

625
00:53:43,405 --> 00:53:47,355
It's all thanks to the
support you've given me.

626
00:53:47,450 --> 00:53:50,844
That sounds like a
victory speech, already?

627
00:53:50,966 --> 00:53:53,503
Ohh... 
Did I really sound like that?

628
00:53:53,590 --> 00:53:54,923
I apologize.

629
00:53:55,026 --> 00:54:01,865
But it'll be interesting to see how 
Jo Pilyeon will react to all this.

630
00:54:06,863 --> 00:54:08,072
You bastard.

631
00:54:08,147 --> 00:54:10,423
Did I tell you to investigate
him thoroughly or not?

632
00:54:10,526 --> 00:54:12,902
What the hell did you dig into?

633
00:54:13,052 --> 00:54:13,805
I apologize.

634
00:54:13,870 --> 00:54:16,554
If you are, then die for it,
you son of a bitch!

635
00:54:16,676 --> 00:54:18,247
Stop!

636
00:54:18,576 --> 00:54:20,260
<i>Please, calm down.</i>

637
00:54:26,224 --> 00:54:28,724
What happened to 
that damned informer?

638
00:54:29,476 --> 00:54:31,945
He moved and 
completely disappeared.

639
00:54:32,110 --> 00:54:33,826
Seongmo, you...

640
00:54:34,202 --> 00:54:38,159
Even if the entire ANSP has to 
get involved, find him at all cost!

641
00:54:38,318 --> 00:54:41,341
Min Honggi is behind him for sure!

642
00:54:41,685 --> 00:54:42,898
All right.

643
00:54:43,011 --> 00:54:46,536
But, there is another bad news.

644
00:54:46,705 --> 00:54:47,862
What, again?

645
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:52,992
Those mudflats Lee Gangmo owned
are registered under someone else.

646
00:54:53,185 --> 00:54:54,896
And who is that?

647
00:54:55,066 --> 00:54:59,762
A certain James Lee,
a Korean expat living in the States.

648
00:55:00,078 --> 00:55:01,592
An expat?!

649
00:55:01,790 --> 00:55:05,185
Are you telling me the man who
owns that land lives in America?

650
00:55:05,326 --> 00:55:09,946
According to the copyist in charge of
the transaction, there's no way to trace him.

651
00:55:22,696 --> 00:55:25,249
I can't let them ruin me this way.

652
00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:29,552
Jo Pilyeon won't take this lying down.

653
00:55:29,796 --> 00:55:31,188
I can't...

654
00:55:31,574 --> 00:55:35,025
I won't die this way!

655
00:55:38,105 --> 00:55:40,789
<i>This is only the 
beginning, Jo Pilyeon.</i>

656
00:55:41,099 --> 00:55:42,849
<i>You will slowly...</i>

657
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:46,479
<i>and painfully come face to face 
with your destruction.</i>

658
00:55:47,673 --> 00:55:49,308
Hurry up!

659
00:55:49,402 --> 00:55:51,047
Let's get moving!

660
00:55:51,386 --> 00:55:52,919
Move!

661
00:55:53,361 --> 00:55:55,261
I said move!

662
00:55:56,116 --> 00:55:58,188
<i>Move!</i>

663
00:56:02,159 --> 00:56:04,753
<i>The hell are you doing?</i>

664
00:56:05,185 --> 00:56:07,207
I... I'm sorry...

665
00:56:07,301 --> 00:56:10,349
What are you doing? Get up!

666
00:56:13,125 --> 00:56:15,617
I apologize.

667
00:56:30,015 --> 00:56:31,537
<i>- Hardtack -</i>

668
00:56:31,621 --> 00:56:36,596
It's just that I get chills every
time I see gravel like this now.

669
00:56:39,662 --> 00:56:41,518
Show me that leg of yours.

670
00:56:41,603 --> 00:56:42,638
<i>It's nothing.</i>

671
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:45,205
- Let me see!
- Forget it...

672
00:56:45,374 --> 00:56:46,625
Sit.

673
00:56:48,007 --> 00:56:49,512
<i>Pull it up.</i>

674
00:56:49,625 --> 00:56:51,235
<i>Come on.</i>

675
00:56:59,665 --> 00:57:01,843
You stupid fool...

676
00:57:03,828 --> 00:57:05,579
Let's go to the infirmary.

677
00:57:06,447 --> 00:57:07,366
It's no use.

678
00:57:07,448 --> 00:57:09,940
They'll have to cut off 
your leg, you fool!

679
00:57:10,904 --> 00:57:13,514
Want to live the rest of
your days as a cripple?

680
00:57:14,379 --> 00:57:16,418
Think I never tried going there?

681
00:57:16,917 --> 00:57:20,227
I got on my knees
begging them to fix it,

682
00:57:20,641 --> 00:57:22,663
but all I got in return were lashes.

683
00:57:23,365 --> 00:57:24,912
Get it?

684
00:57:26,558 --> 00:57:27,987
<i>Just...</i>

685
00:57:29,294 --> 00:57:34,937
Don't mind me.

686
00:57:59,386 --> 00:58:01,350
<i>Quick! Let's get moving!</i>

687
00:58:01,448 --> 00:58:04,565
<i>Come down, quick!</i>

688
00:58:12,766 --> 00:58:14,656
What's with you? Get up!

689
00:58:14,759 --> 00:58:18,326
Get moving, you fool!

690
00:58:21,182 --> 00:58:23,683
<i>What are you waiting for?
Get moving!</i>

691
00:58:23,777 --> 00:58:26,552
We'll be moving that calcium
chloride to the warehouse.

692
00:58:26,716 --> 00:58:28,211
Load it all on the truck.

693
00:58:28,305 --> 00:58:30,308
- Proceed!
- Proceed!

694
00:58:30,581 --> 00:58:31,794
Get moving!

695
00:58:31,879 --> 00:58:34,921
<i>You pricks, get moving!</i>

696
00:58:49,617 --> 00:58:53,014
That precious cement 
will all become stiff.

697
00:59:01,957 --> 00:59:04,251
Sotae, isn't this strange?

698
00:59:05,179 --> 00:59:08,187
Only the cement next to
calcium chloride sacks got stiff.

699
00:59:08,270 --> 00:59:12,219
And what does that matter?

700
00:59:22,503 --> 00:59:25,054
Calcium chloride
dissolved in rainwater...

701
00:59:25,747 --> 00:59:28,016
hardened the cement?!

702
00:59:28,286 --> 00:59:30,544
<i>Want me to give you a hint?</i>

703
00:59:30,743 --> 00:59:33,141
You can find it all around us?!

704
00:59:33,341 --> 00:59:36,181
Take that and use it wisely.

705
00:59:36,275 --> 00:59:40,354
Then you can finish 
this all in a week.

706
01:00:27,984 --> 01:00:30,829
I told you Jeongyeon has aphasia!

707
01:00:31,017 --> 01:00:33,556
We don't even know
when she'll wake up from it.

708
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:39,116
So let all the
shareholders know about it.

709
01:00:39,739 --> 01:00:42,827
I told you, even the chairman
can't do a thing about it.

710
01:00:42,921 --> 01:00:46,178
Anyhow, I'll be counting on you.

711
01:00:48,564 --> 01:00:49,728
What did he say?

712
01:00:49,822 --> 01:00:52,714
Will they push for me as heir 
at the next shareholders' meeting?

713
01:00:52,819 --> 01:00:58,209
Jeongshik, starting now, 
you start preparing to become heir.

714
01:00:59,056 --> 01:01:00,760
All right, Mom.

715
01:01:01,912 --> 01:01:05,119
- You're the best!
- My boy.

716
01:01:05,322 --> 01:01:09,031
You'll finally inherit
Manbo Construction, uh?

717
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:12,358
- Mom.
- Uh?

718
01:01:12,475 --> 01:01:14,109
Should I let you in on a secret?

719
01:01:14,250 --> 01:01:15,125
Secret?!

720
01:01:15,231 --> 01:01:16,818
<i>What secret?</i>

721
01:01:17,088 --> 01:01:22,554
Actually, what happened to 
Jeongyeon was all my idea.

722
01:01:22,931 --> 01:01:24,670
What's that supposed to mean?

723
01:01:24,929 --> 01:01:27,863
<i>So she caught aphasia 
because of you?</i>

724
01:01:27,945 --> 01:01:29,144
Yeah...

725
01:01:29,321 --> 01:01:34,140
It was Minwoo and I who sent
Gangmo to the Samcheong camp.

726
01:01:34,223 --> 01:01:35,868
<i>Really?!</i>

727
01:01:36,315 --> 01:01:39,348
And how did you manage?

728
01:01:39,548 --> 01:01:41,418
We just asked Minwoo's father.

729
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:43,804
To send Gangmo 
to the Samcheong camp.

730
01:01:44,027 --> 01:01:46,966
Think it was an accident 
that killed him?

731
01:01:47,166 --> 01:01:50,799
Minwoo's father paid 
someone off to get rid of him.

732
01:01:51,398 --> 01:01:57,799
<i>So... Minwoo's father killed Gangmo
on Minwoo's and your behalf?</i>

733
01:01:57,881 --> 01:01:59,162
<i>Yeah!</i>

734
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:13,593
What's she doing,
prancing around like that?

735
01:02:13,745 --> 01:02:16,649
Aigoo... Really...

736
01:02:20,846 --> 01:02:22,330
We're screwed.

737
01:02:22,483 --> 01:02:26,739
There's no completing
the road on time, this way.

738
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,836
<i>Only a moment will do!</i>

739
01:02:29,243 --> 01:02:30,642
What's with you?

740
01:02:30,759 --> 01:02:31,973
I have something to tell you.

741
01:02:32,039 --> 01:02:34,587
Are you out of your mind?

742
01:02:36,007 --> 01:02:37,634
Give me control of the construction.

743
01:02:37,738 --> 01:02:39,130
You little...

744
01:02:41,234 --> 01:02:42,762
What did you just say?

745
01:02:43,138 --> 01:02:44,774
If you entrust me with 
this construction,

746
01:02:44,925 --> 01:02:46,458
I will finish it on time.

747
01:02:46,580 --> 01:02:49,495
- We only have four days left.
- We can just lay the cement in two days.

748
01:02:49,589 --> 01:02:51,471
And it'll take four-five days to dry.

749
01:02:51,667 --> 01:02:53,572
We can do it in just two days.

750
01:02:53,723 --> 01:02:54,466
What?!

751
01:02:54,616 --> 01:02:56,064
Two days are enough.

752
01:02:56,196 --> 01:02:56,930
And if it's not?

753
01:02:57,024 --> 01:02:58,688
If we do make it,
what will you do?

754
01:03:00,052 --> 01:03:04,458
Accept my conditions.

755
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:06,489
I only have two.

756
01:03:17,302 --> 01:03:21,213
I think she needs to be 
hospitalized once again.

757
01:03:22,078 --> 01:03:26,649
Will it take long for her
to regain consciousness?

758
01:03:26,921 --> 01:03:29,432
<i>Yes, I'm afraid so.</i>

759
01:03:56,162 --> 01:03:57,949
Jeongyeon?

760
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:04,719
<i>Just remain in this state forever.</i>

761
01:04:06,647 --> 01:04:08,452
Are we clear?

762
01:04:09,868 --> 01:04:12,176
Forever, and ever.

763
01:05:12,507 --> 01:05:15,010
I will get my revenge.

764
01:05:18,831 --> 01:05:22,037
Everyone who caused Gangmo's death...

765
01:05:24,835 --> 01:05:26,822
will suffer...

766
01:05:28,562 --> 01:05:31,759
indescribable pain for what they did.
