5
00:00:18,684 --> 00:00:20,489
You're hurting me!

6
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:23,705
Keep quiet!

7
00:00:30,743 --> 00:00:32,451
How many times
do I have to tell you?

8
00:00:32,517 --> 00:00:34,365
I didn't demonstrate.

9
00:00:34,481 --> 00:00:36,559
You were found with demonstrators.

10
00:00:36,748 --> 00:00:40,411
I was waiting outside 31 Building,
and they just arrested me.

11
00:00:40,504 --> 00:00:41,235
Shut it.

12
00:00:41,349 --> 00:00:42,831
Which college and year?

13
00:00:43,762 --> 00:00:45,185
Your school's name!

14
00:00:46,539 --> 00:00:49,052
I'm not a college student.

15
00:00:49,147 --> 00:00:51,236
Then, what are you?

16
00:00:53,467 --> 00:00:54,824
I...

17
00:00:57,463 --> 00:00:58,843
am a housemaid.

18
00:00:58,966 --> 00:00:59,950
Uh?!

19
00:01:00,508 --> 00:01:01,850
Housemaid.

20
00:01:02,124 --> 00:01:03,439
Housemaid?!

21
00:01:05,185 --> 00:01:07,556
The ones cooking,
doing the laundry and stuff?

22
00:01:07,652 --> 00:01:08,976
Yes.

23
00:01:10,857 --> 00:01:12,674
Are you telling the truth?

24
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:16,569
Can't you call and find out?

25
00:02:47,941 --> 00:02:50,415
Wow... You sure are lucky.

26
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,958
If it weren't for the police,
you'd all be dead by now.

27
00:02:53,044 --> 00:02:53,677
<i>You know?</i>

28
00:02:53,781 --> 00:02:55,313
Shut your mouth,
you sorry-ass thug!

29
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:57,396
What?! Thug?!

30
00:03:06,894 --> 00:03:12,377
Think you'll gain any
of that land this way?

31
00:03:15,497 --> 00:03:17,320
Give up while you still can.

32
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,944
Manbo Construction.

33
00:03:21,124 --> 00:03:22,187
Come out.

34
00:03:22,338 --> 00:03:24,343
They've come for us.

35
00:03:26,428 --> 00:03:27,492
Hey.

36
00:03:27,751 --> 00:03:29,383
<i>We'll get going first,</i>

37
00:03:29,497 --> 00:03:31,915
so have a nice rest here.

38
00:03:35,508 --> 00:03:36,860
I'll remember this.

39
00:03:36,955 --> 00:03:38,383
<i>Sit down, sit.</i>

40
00:03:38,647 --> 00:03:41,295
<i>They'll come for us
soon as well, I guess.</i>

41
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:43,663
<i>I won't forget this.</i>

42
00:03:44,896 --> 00:03:46,188
You went through a lot.

43
00:03:51,465 --> 00:03:54,258
The five companies of
the construction committee...

44
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,773
will pave the way for our win
at the subway construction bid.

45
00:03:57,236 --> 00:04:04,523
I made sure our opening bid will be
0.5 to 2 percent lower than theirs.

46
00:04:04,977 --> 00:04:06,631
That's all fine and dandy,

47
00:04:06,802 --> 00:04:09,780
but is there no way to
reduce construction expenses?

48
00:04:10,226 --> 00:04:12,756
By at least five percent.

49
00:04:12,851 --> 00:04:14,770
Realistically, that's impossible.

50
00:04:14,893 --> 00:04:18,713
I mean, shouldn't we make
a little profit out of this?

51
00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:22,975
Because of the oil crisis,
the price of raw materials is skyrocketing,

52
00:04:23,281 --> 00:04:27,174
and subcontractors will not accept
any renegotiation of our existing deals.

53
00:04:27,287 --> 00:04:29,433
We still have some time until the bid,

54
00:04:29,528 --> 00:04:31,071
so try to find a way.

55
00:04:31,182 --> 00:04:32,743
<i>I will.</i>

56
00:04:36,961 --> 00:04:38,701
I don't think it's something
you should worry about?!

57
00:04:38,805 --> 00:04:42,474
If I meet with the subcontractors
and try to convince them, it'll work.

58
00:04:42,597 --> 00:04:43,949
And I can check our progress
on the field as well.

59
00:04:44,053 --> 00:04:45,445
Look, Hwang Jeongyeon.

60
00:04:45,511 --> 00:04:46,854
<i>Go ahead, then.</i>

61
00:04:47,604 --> 00:04:48,650
Chairman.

62
00:04:49,544 --> 00:04:53,208
If she says she will convince them,
why should we try to stop her?

63
00:04:53,757 --> 00:04:54,929
<i>But let's be clear.</i>

64
00:04:55,374 --> 00:04:59,918
I won't accept any
"I tried, but it didn't work."

65
00:05:07,436 --> 00:05:08,908
Hwang Jeongyeon.

66
00:05:10,837 --> 00:05:12,587
Let's have a word in private.

67
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,475
What are you doing?

68
00:05:35,328 --> 00:05:36,681
Get out of the way.

69
00:05:37,135 --> 00:05:39,218
If you don't, I'll start screaming.

70
00:05:39,653 --> 00:05:41,090
Go ahead.

71
00:05:49,006 --> 00:05:50,491
Let go!

72
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:55,614
If you can't even deal with this much,

73
00:05:56,123 --> 00:05:58,986
how are you going to face
those rugged construction workers?

74
00:05:59,771 --> 00:06:01,501
You're going to face
something much worse than this,

75
00:06:01,577 --> 00:06:03,875
so how are you
going to deal with that?

76
00:06:04,687 --> 00:06:09,028
It's hard even for men to
deal with people on the field.

77
00:06:09,189 --> 00:06:12,944
It's out of a woman's league,
am I making myself clear?

78
00:06:20,931 --> 00:06:22,416
Let's go, Agasshi.

79
00:06:23,985 --> 00:06:27,787
If I was going to give up for this little,
I wouldn't even have started.

80
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:31,644
Also, act like this with me again,

81
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:33,829
and you'll pay for it.

82
00:06:34,576 --> 00:06:36,505
I'm not saying that as
an employee of this company,

83
00:06:36,571 --> 00:06:38,254
but as the chairman's daughter.

84
00:06:48,754 --> 00:06:51,118
I thought I made myself clear?!

85
00:06:51,799 --> 00:06:54,795
That I will take care of her from now on.

86
00:06:54,994 --> 00:06:57,481
Only I can decide where I belong.

87
00:06:57,765 --> 00:06:59,968
Be it past, present or future,

88
00:07:00,781 --> 00:07:02,882
I'll take care of her.

89
00:07:03,061 --> 00:07:04,726
Bother her again,

90
00:07:05,028 --> 00:07:08,669
and you'll have to deal with me.

91
00:07:09,104 --> 00:07:11,988
Do you believe you're in
any position to threaten me?

92
00:07:12,489 --> 00:07:14,734
Don't ignore my warnings.

93
00:07:14,885 --> 00:07:17,892
Please... Look at yourself in the
mirror before you act all feisty.

94
00:07:18,443 --> 00:07:22,914
I'm tired of wasting time with people
who couldn't lace my boots.

95
00:07:23,046 --> 00:07:27,963
We'll see if that's really the case.

96
00:07:41,609 --> 00:07:45,928
Please, don't act like that and
take another look at the estimates.

97
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,077
He's asking for a discount,
do I even need to look at it?

98
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,184
Director...

99
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:52,003
Go look elsewhere.

100
00:07:52,111 --> 00:07:54,715
Do you know that with this kind
of money it's useless even trying?

101
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:55,993
I do.

102
00:07:56,204 --> 00:07:57,349
- However...
- Young lady.

103
00:07:57,462 --> 00:07:59,457
What is your position?

104
00:07:59,684 --> 00:08:02,625
I'll soon be a team supervisor?!

105
00:08:02,937 --> 00:08:06,392
It's no use talking with a woman who
doesn't know a thing about construction,

106
00:08:06,502 --> 00:08:07,903
so bring me your male superior!

107
00:08:08,007 --> 00:08:09,435
This is under my jurisdiction.

108
00:08:09,529 --> 00:08:10,957
It has nothing to do with my superior.

109
00:08:11,061 --> 00:08:12,054
What are you doing?

110
00:08:12,149 --> 00:08:13,473
Get this lady out of my face.

111
00:08:13,842 --> 00:08:14,797
Director...

112
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,072
- Don't act like this...
- Please, let's go.

113
00:08:16,214 --> 00:08:18,987
Wait... Wait. I'll go.

114
00:08:19,623 --> 00:08:21,150
I'll come again.

115
00:08:21,273 --> 00:08:23,296
<i>Let me ask you one more time.</i>

116
00:08:24,308 --> 00:08:25,216
Wait...

117
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,831
I can leave by myself!

118
00:08:37,218 --> 00:08:38,776
It's me, Director Kim.

119
00:08:39,079 --> 00:08:42,851
A young lady from Manbo
Construction will be there soon.

120
00:08:49,874 --> 00:08:51,982
Hey... Let's get moving, shall we?

121
00:08:52,077 --> 00:08:54,223
When are we going to finish,
if you keep this up?

122
00:08:54,384 --> 00:08:56,843
Just take a look at
the contract estimates.

123
00:08:56,947 --> 00:08:58,552
Look, young lady.

124
00:08:58,794 --> 00:09:01,199
Before you ask for a discount,
know how much those service costs are?

125
00:09:01,266 --> 00:09:02,854
Forget about the discount for now,

126
00:09:02,939 --> 00:09:06,958
- and start by taking a look...
- Ehhh... You're here again?

127
00:09:07,237 --> 00:09:09,070
I told you to pick
laborers right, didn't I?

128
00:09:09,155 --> 00:09:10,176
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

129
00:09:11,472 --> 00:09:13,448
- Director!
- Wait a moment.

130
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,387
How many did you load?

131
00:09:15,893 --> 00:09:17,098
Go on.

132
00:09:20,964 --> 00:09:22,328
More, more!

133
00:09:23,834 --> 00:09:25,354
A few more.

134
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,833
There. Go, quick.

135
00:09:34,352 --> 00:09:35,139
Director.

136
00:09:35,252 --> 00:09:36,406
I'm not asking for anything difficult.

137
00:09:36,472 --> 00:09:39,636
- Just take a look at this.
- Ehh... How annoying, really.

138
00:09:41,518 --> 00:09:43,277
Director, wait a moment.

139
00:09:52,247 --> 00:09:53,297
Director.

140
00:09:53,391 --> 00:09:54,337
Please, just once more.

141
00:09:54,403 --> 00:09:56,588
Ehh... You really!

142
00:09:56,881 --> 00:09:58,715
Let's hurry up!

143
00:09:58,971 --> 00:10:01,278
Director, please, I'm asking you.

144
00:10:01,372 --> 00:10:03,972
I said forget it!

145
00:10:16,112 --> 00:10:18,542
That damned old fart!

146
00:10:21,423 --> 00:10:22,247
<i>Listen!</i>

147
00:10:22,332 --> 00:10:24,271
You want heads to roll around here?

148
00:10:24,356 --> 00:10:26,134
- Get this lady out of here!
- Yes, Director.

149
00:10:26,228 --> 00:10:28,933
- No, wait...
- Do you know what we risked?

150
00:10:32,631 --> 00:10:37,207
The daughter of Manbo Construction's
chairman facing such embarrassment...

151
00:10:40,177 --> 00:10:41,642
Shideok.

152
00:10:42,824 --> 00:10:46,848
We need to dig into the
subway deal's subcontractors.

153
00:10:47,283 --> 00:10:51,812
Not just the ongoing construction,
but also their work in the past.

154
00:10:51,982 --> 00:10:53,703
Find everything you can.

155
00:10:54,837 --> 00:10:56,713
There has to be
something fishy going on.

156
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,251
Why are you asking, suddenly?

157
00:10:58,355 --> 00:11:02,223
I'll have to help her out.

158
00:11:02,374 --> 00:11:04,734
Ahh... Really...

159
00:11:05,147 --> 00:11:09,566
Why, think she'll be
thankful if you do that?

160
00:11:20,436 --> 00:11:22,669
You're drinking without any side dishes?

161
00:11:23,556 --> 00:11:26,352
- Ajumma, some soup over here.
- Yes.

162
00:11:26,494 --> 00:11:28,140
You know me?

163
00:11:28,943 --> 00:11:30,456
Haven't you seen me earlier on?

164
00:11:30,598 --> 00:11:33,378
I worked at the construction site, too.

165
00:11:34,012 --> 00:11:36,415
They said not to
come anymore, from now on.

166
00:11:36,755 --> 00:11:39,488
Think they won't grow old, too?

167
00:11:46,725 --> 00:11:48,945
Then again, when the
entire country is so rotten,

168
00:11:49,021 --> 00:11:51,896
why would this business
be any different?!

169
00:11:52,729 --> 00:11:54,733
Damned thieves...

170
00:11:55,225 --> 00:11:57,753
What are you trying to say?

171
00:11:58,525 --> 00:12:00,363
Thieves?!

172
00:12:00,856 --> 00:12:06,279
A few days back, I got drunk and
fell asleep at the construction site.

173
00:12:10,404 --> 00:12:12,670
Shouldn't even talk about it...

174
00:12:14,946 --> 00:12:19,554
So they were secretly selling
off raw materials, I guess?

175
00:12:19,847 --> 00:12:22,060
When you get older and
have some money to spend,

176
00:12:22,107 --> 00:12:23,724
choose your house well.

177
00:12:23,819 --> 00:12:27,724
You never know when the buildings
those thieves built may collapse.

178
00:12:35,849 --> 00:12:37,009
That Hwang Jeongyeon.

179
00:12:37,103 --> 00:12:40,838
She's clueless and still has the guts
to take over the subcontractor issue?

180
00:12:40,946 --> 00:12:42,105
Tell me about it...

181
00:12:42,237 --> 00:12:44,866
Daddy's little girl must
have lived up to her pedigree,

182
00:12:44,942 --> 00:12:47,608
considering we got dozens
of complaints today alone.

183
00:12:48,342 --> 00:12:52,790
Is it true that her
real mother was a bar girl?

184
00:12:52,881 --> 00:12:54,481
That's what I've heard.

185
00:12:54,623 --> 00:12:57,486
She cheated on the chairman,
and was even kicked out.

186
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,821
- Really?
- Yeah.

187
00:13:00,156 --> 00:13:05,004
<i>Seeing how she wags her tail around
Chief Jo Minwoo just makes me sick.</i>

188
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:06,015
<i>Right...</i>

189
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:09,486
<i>Doesn't seem like he has
any interest in her, anyway...</i>

190
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:43,470
Any progress?

191
00:13:45,455 --> 00:13:46,657
Yes.

192
00:13:47,555 --> 00:13:50,825
It's going wonderfully,
so you don't need to worry.

193
00:13:51,052 --> 00:13:52,509
Get up.

194
00:13:52,738 --> 00:13:54,807
We urgently need to go somewhere.

195
00:14:03,865 --> 00:14:06,727
Minwoo! Here.

196
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:12,283
What is this?

197
00:14:12,565 --> 00:14:13,843
I told you.

198
00:14:14,051 --> 00:14:16,112
It's an important meeting,
business-wise.

199
00:14:17,466 --> 00:14:18,864
I'll talk plainly from now on.

200
00:14:19,034 --> 00:14:22,028
- It's better that way here.
- Look, Chief Jo Minwoo!

201
00:14:31,135 --> 00:14:34,431
Hey... Why did you bring her?

202
00:14:37,056 --> 00:14:38,450
Let me make the introductions.

203
00:14:38,592 --> 00:14:42,033
This is the daughter of Manbo
Construction's Chairman Hwang Taeseop,

204
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:43,678
<i>Hwang Jeongyeon.</i>

205
00:14:45,047 --> 00:14:47,865
He's the second heir of
Korea Group, Lee Jongcheol.

206
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:50,988
Welcome. Nice to meet you.

207
00:14:51,595 --> 00:14:54,518
And here's the heir and president
of Dongguk Bank, Yang Inmo.

208
00:14:54,584 --> 00:14:55,520
How are you?

209
00:14:55,681 --> 00:14:57,430
Daeyang Trading's youngest,
Jang Byeongsam.

210
00:14:57,534 --> 00:14:59,463
<i>Geosan Auto's Choi Wookseon.</i>

211
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:02,794
Jeongshik.
If it's Manbo Construction...

212
00:15:02,907 --> 00:15:04,430
Is she your sister?

213
00:15:04,808 --> 00:15:07,163
Sister? Yeah, right.

214
00:15:08,758 --> 00:15:13,551
Since when did we allow illegitimate
children to hang around with us?

215
00:15:14,251 --> 00:15:17,892
<i>Ehh... This is just beneath me,
it's no fun.</i>

216
00:15:23,807 --> 00:15:26,166
Jeongshik, be careful what you say.

217
00:15:26,979 --> 00:15:29,778
Jeongyeon came here as my woman.

218
00:15:33,485 --> 00:15:36,493
And they say it runs in the family...

219
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,555
You.

220
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:42,764
Since when did you
start seducing Jo Minwoo?

221
00:15:44,588 --> 00:15:45,635
What?

222
00:15:46,713 --> 00:15:47,876
Minwoo.

223
00:15:48,122 --> 00:15:50,562
Let me give you an advice.

224
00:15:51,545 --> 00:15:54,070
You know, her real mother?!

225
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:00,684
Try to say just another word!

226
00:16:00,922 --> 00:16:02,141
And see what happens.

227
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:04,675
What's wrong with you?
We haven't met in so long.

228
00:16:04,779 --> 00:16:06,333
Here, let's change the mood.

229
00:16:06,475 --> 00:16:08,986
Jeongyeon, have a drink.

230
00:16:24,415 --> 00:16:26,430
That bastard...

231
00:16:26,661 --> 00:16:27,985
Blood!

232
00:16:33,337 --> 00:16:34,254
Don't go.

233
00:16:34,431 --> 00:16:35,361
Why?

234
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:38,891
So I can keep watching you
put on airs in front of me?

235
00:16:39,055 --> 00:16:40,890
You're really pathetic.

236
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,055
Do I look that easy a woman to you?

237
00:16:43,178 --> 00:16:45,930
Thought you could just do
whatever you want with me?

238
00:16:46,191 --> 00:16:47,727
Don't kid yourself.

239
00:16:47,907 --> 00:16:50,919
People like you make me sick.

240
00:16:51,707 --> 00:16:53,906
- Are you done?
- No.

241
00:16:54,105 --> 00:16:56,053
I'll say one more thing before I go.

242
00:16:56,989 --> 00:16:59,839
I won't always work under you.

243
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:03,243
And I'll remember all this.

244
00:17:03,376 --> 00:17:06,638
Because people like you
certainly don't help the company.

245
00:17:06,752 --> 00:17:11,480
Those people are thinking of
investing in Manbo Construction.

246
00:17:12,151 --> 00:17:14,317
With their funds,
we'll make a lot more money...

247
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:17,958
than what that five percent off of
the subway bid would have given us.

248
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:23,667
But you just committed a serious
blunder right under their noses.

249
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:27,317
So before you worry about
firing me later,

250
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:30,297
first think if you really have what
it takes to gain the right to do so.

251
00:17:30,401 --> 00:17:31,754
So?!

252
00:17:32,444 --> 00:17:36,094
Did you bring me here today
so that I could give up on that?

253
00:17:37,159 --> 00:17:41,072
You'll pardon me,
but I can't give that up.

254
00:17:41,219 --> 00:17:41,956
I won't.

255
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:44,500
Letting pride move everything you do
despite being clueless...

256
00:17:45,067 --> 00:17:46,675
I'm afraid that's not too charming.

257
00:17:46,883 --> 00:17:48,169
Charming?!

258
00:17:48,612 --> 00:17:50,590
And why should I
ooze charm all over you?

259
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:52,614
Don't you kid yourself.

260
00:17:53,588 --> 00:17:55,385
I didn't mean as a woman,

261
00:17:55,829 --> 00:17:58,666
just as an employee working for me.

262
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:05,599
You can find your way home, right?

263
00:18:28,628 --> 00:18:32,496
Now Hwang Taeseop is even
buying land around the subway.

264
00:18:32,776 --> 00:18:39,949
If we let Hwang Taeseop win the bid this way,
it's over for Daeryuk Construction.

265
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:42,880
But we still have time.

266
00:18:43,306 --> 00:18:46,243
Find a way to stop the bid.

267
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,773
I will.

268
00:18:48,428 --> 00:18:50,516
I really can't figure it out.

269
00:18:51,404 --> 00:18:56,908
Why Chairmen Jo, Baek and Cheon
betrayed me so suddenly.

270
00:19:02,633 --> 00:19:05,528
Have some of this.
We only had fruits.

271
00:19:05,689 --> 00:19:08,143
Leave it there.

272
00:19:16,694 --> 00:19:18,827
Did you call me, Ma'am?

273
00:19:21,865 --> 00:19:23,936
You'll deafen me.

274
00:19:24,087 --> 00:19:25,477
Why did it take you so long?

275
00:19:25,562 --> 00:19:26,681
Long?!

276
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:28,790
Haven't you seen me
run here like an arrow?

277
00:19:28,894 --> 00:19:30,189
You rotten wench...

278
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:33,758
I've had to starve
all day because of you.

279
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,861
You told me I had the day off
every last day of the month.

280
00:19:36,974 --> 00:19:39,423
I even prepared you lunch before I left.

281
00:19:39,816 --> 00:19:40,965
Bring me some water.

282
00:19:41,059 --> 00:19:42,695
Just a moment.

283
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:45,844
Forget the water,

284
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:47,425
bring me orange juice.

285
00:19:47,548 --> 00:19:49,079
All right.

286
00:19:50,706 --> 00:19:51,935
No.

287
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:53,864
Just bring me water.

288
00:19:58,404 --> 00:20:01,349
You were bored all day, weren't you?

289
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:05,083
It's because you want
to play with me, right?

290
00:20:05,188 --> 00:20:07,469
Who ever talked
about playing with you?

291
00:20:07,558 --> 00:20:09,792
Leave.
Get out of my face.

292
00:20:10,473 --> 00:20:13,622
I'll bring you both water and juice.

293
00:20:18,465 --> 00:20:20,224
I'm sorry, Miju.

294
00:20:21,463 --> 00:20:25,854
Nobody ever lasted past ten days.

295
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:30,849
Until you tell me to leave,
I'll stay here.

296
00:20:31,738 --> 00:20:33,213
Thanks.

297
00:20:33,714 --> 00:20:36,419
I'll bring it to her,
so you can go to sleep.

298
00:20:36,532 --> 00:20:38,329
Yes, Chairman.

299
00:20:39,241 --> 00:20:40,677
Right...

300
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,863
About what I told you last time.

301
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:46,965
About finding someone for me.

302
00:20:47,317 --> 00:20:49,083
Ahh... Right.

303
00:20:49,596 --> 00:20:51,873
<i>I'm so busy these days...</i>

304
00:20:52,638 --> 00:20:54,649
You said it was your brothers, right?

305
00:20:55,386 --> 00:20:58,355
I'll have someone look into it.

306
00:20:59,188 --> 00:21:01,920
Thank you, Chairman.

307
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:46,766
Hide-and-seek is long over.

308
00:21:48,695 --> 00:21:52,099
So just show up, will you?

309
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:54,836
Seongmo Oppa.

310
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:58,070
Gangmo Oppa.

311
00:22:46,275 --> 00:22:50,050
Are we just wasting our time,
listening to what that old man said?

312
00:22:50,211 --> 00:22:53,341
There are rumors that
subcontractors are in cahoots.

313
00:22:53,814 --> 00:22:57,861
And if we want to stop that,
we must find their weak spot.

314
00:23:00,687 --> 00:23:02,910
And how long do we have to stay here?

315
00:23:03,788 --> 00:23:08,211
It's not like they'll
smuggle that off every night.

316
00:23:16,473 --> 00:23:18,459
Aigoo...

317
00:23:22,202 --> 00:23:23,339
What's this?

318
00:23:23,906 --> 00:23:26,535
<i>It's the curfew siren.</i>

319
00:23:27,472 --> 00:23:30,999
Forget about going home tonight.

320
00:23:32,418 --> 00:23:34,243
This won't do.

321
00:23:34,803 --> 00:23:36,541
We need to find another way.

322
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:39,301
Finding their account
would be much quicker.

323
00:23:39,415 --> 00:23:40,455
Account?

324
00:23:40,824 --> 00:23:41,571
What account?

325
00:23:41,675 --> 00:23:43,679
If they sold off those raw materials,

326
00:23:43,988 --> 00:23:46,526
there must be some kind
of account listing those deals.

327
00:23:47,313 --> 00:23:49,126
We'll look for that.

328
00:23:50,194 --> 00:23:51,499
Whatever.

329
00:23:51,665 --> 00:23:54,034
Do as you wish.

330
00:24:01,211 --> 00:24:02,724
Gangmo.

331
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:06,734
Don't fall for Jeongyeon.

332
00:24:09,987 --> 00:24:15,137
Seeing you do all this
for her sake is killing me.

333
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:18,305
<i>Can you even dream about her?!</i>

334
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:21,401
It's not that.

335
00:24:21,581 --> 00:24:24,276
<i>Aigoo... I'm sure that's the case.</i>

336
00:24:24,654 --> 00:24:28,512
I'm just worried she'll hurt you.

337
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:43,733
Still working, I see.

338
00:24:44,021 --> 00:24:45,180
Is it going well?

339
00:24:45,302 --> 00:24:46,607
Don't worry.

340
00:24:46,754 --> 00:24:50,371
The bid result will not disappoint you.

341
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:52,855
I'm not concerned
about that in the slightest.

342
00:24:53,309 --> 00:24:56,949
Is it going well with
Chairman Hwang's daughter?

343
00:24:57,387 --> 00:25:00,647
I'm just going at it my way.

344
00:25:00,883 --> 00:25:05,489
All right. Now that you've seen her,
what do you think?

345
00:25:05,688 --> 00:25:07,437
What are you asking me?

346
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:10,236
Once the subway bid succeeds,

347
00:25:10,397 --> 00:25:15,234
Manbo Construction's stature
will rise exponentially.

348
00:25:15,753 --> 00:25:20,377
It'd be the perfect opportunity
to tie the knot between our clans...

349
00:25:20,623 --> 00:25:24,438
So you want me to marry her?

350
00:25:24,613 --> 00:25:27,219
Chairman Hwang and I
have a kind of symbiosis.

351
00:25:27,389 --> 00:25:29,942
Wouldn't it be better
to make that official?

352
00:25:30,065 --> 00:25:34,273
So what you're talking about
is not marriage, but a deal.

353
00:25:34,547 --> 00:25:39,448
Because love or anything else which involves
giving and taking is a sort of deal.

354
00:25:41,642 --> 00:25:43,069
I'll do as you say.

355
00:25:43,731 --> 00:25:45,118
So you give your consent?

356
00:25:45,222 --> 00:25:46,981
Giving consent was always up to you.

357
00:25:47,085 --> 00:25:51,624
I merely followed your wishes.

358
00:25:55,038 --> 00:25:59,636
You might be my son, but I love the fact
we always understand each other.

359
00:26:15,644 --> 00:26:17,009
So?

360
00:26:17,124 --> 00:26:22,029
Are you telling me that brat is prancing
around construction sites to cut costs?

361
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:22,871
Yes.

362
00:26:22,975 --> 00:26:25,859
And the chairman told her to do so himself.

363
00:26:25,982 --> 00:26:27,059
Yes.

364
00:26:28,541 --> 00:26:31,476
Ajumma, some fresh water.

365
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,282
Yes.

366
00:26:33,981 --> 00:26:37,790
Mom, what if Jeongyeon really
ends up inheriting the company?

367
00:26:37,883 --> 00:26:39,114
That's never going to happen.

368
00:26:39,256 --> 00:26:40,457
I'll never allow it.

369
00:26:40,571 --> 00:26:42,698
You always only talk, don't you?

370
00:26:42,802 --> 00:26:45,885
You can't get a decent spot
for your only son.

371
00:26:46,027 --> 00:26:48,765
Do you know how embarrassed
I feel with my friends?

372
00:26:48,935 --> 00:26:50,855
She's at work now, right?

373
00:26:51,379 --> 00:26:52,216
Yes, Ma'am.

374
00:26:52,339 --> 00:26:54,855
Tell her we'll meet at the hotel's
coffeehouse down the street.

375
00:26:55,034 --> 00:26:57,115
I can't let this slide.

376
00:27:06,311 --> 00:27:08,524
- See you.
- See you next time.

377
00:27:36,896 --> 00:27:39,038
What do I owe the visit to?

378
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:47,435
Quit the company right now,
and go live on your own.

379
00:27:47,826 --> 00:27:49,770
<i>I put enough in there.</i>

380
00:27:49,866 --> 00:27:53,723
It'll be enough to rent a small room
and get you by for a few months.

381
00:27:53,903 --> 00:27:54,887
You can take that money back.

382
00:27:54,972 --> 00:27:58,336
You're all grown up, how much
longer will I need to raise you?

383
00:27:58,432 --> 00:28:00,659
I'll leave home, so don't you worry.

384
00:28:00,754 --> 00:28:03,942
But I won't quit the company.

385
00:28:06,457 --> 00:28:08,112
You won't?

386
00:28:08,358 --> 00:28:09,182
And why?

387
00:28:09,314 --> 00:28:11,065
You don't know?

388
00:28:11,158 --> 00:28:13,579
I thought you'd know
that better than anyone?!

389
00:28:13,693 --> 00:28:15,224
You wretched wench.

390
00:28:15,763 --> 00:28:18,317
You're finally starting
to show your teeth now?

391
00:28:18,941 --> 00:28:22,464
Think I'll let you inherit that company?

392
00:28:24,015 --> 00:28:27,126
Do you know what's
your biggest mistake?

393
00:28:27,845 --> 00:28:30,133
Not raising your son properly.

394
00:28:30,705 --> 00:28:32,615
If Jeongshik had been
just a little brighter,

395
00:28:32,766 --> 00:28:35,480
think I would have ever dreamed
of inheriting that company?

396
00:28:45,479 --> 00:28:46,875
That company?!

397
00:28:47,575 --> 00:28:49,366
Don't even dream about it.

398
00:28:52,998 --> 00:28:54,690
The company's right next door.

399
00:28:55,058 --> 00:28:56,524
Don't shame yourself.

400
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,763
What?!

401
00:28:57,991 --> 00:28:58,913
Shame?!

402
00:28:59,045 --> 00:29:03,698
If Dad finds out,
you're the one who'll end up in trouble.

403
00:29:04,265 --> 00:29:09,432
I'd rather leave that company to
a mutt passing by than leave it to you.

404
00:30:19,034 --> 00:30:21,171
Are you going to meet
those subcontractors again?

405
00:30:21,275 --> 00:30:22,440
Yes.

406
00:30:23,049 --> 00:30:24,297
Isn't it hard on you?

407
00:30:24,381 --> 00:30:25,533
I'm fine.

408
00:30:25,627 --> 00:30:28,350
Is pretending to be all right
improving things?

409
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:32,714
You can't do all that much
in life with stubbornness alone.

410
00:30:32,818 --> 00:30:36,762
If that's all I've got,
I must at least try.

411
00:30:37,613 --> 00:30:39,239
You're here.

412
00:30:39,929 --> 00:30:41,092
Chief Moon.

413
00:30:41,238 --> 00:30:42,596
Yes?

414
00:30:42,832 --> 00:30:44,925
Once the subway contract is confirmed,

415
00:30:45,077 --> 00:30:47,223
we will receive 8 billion won
in investment funds.

416
00:30:47,545 --> 00:30:53,431
Use that money and find a way
to cut costs by five percent.

417
00:30:53,565 --> 00:30:55,135
Understood.

418
00:31:04,665 --> 00:31:07,369
- A hundred? And this week?
- Another hundred.

419
00:31:07,473 --> 00:31:13,071
- That's what the director said.
- It was seventy last week.

420
00:31:13,866 --> 00:31:16,777
- Director.
- Ohh... You're working hard!

421
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:20,086
Try to find more people like him.

422
00:31:22,395 --> 00:31:25,496
- All in order, right?
- Yes.

423
00:31:25,652 --> 00:31:27,283
It was seventy, wasn't it?

424
00:31:27,378 --> 00:31:29,165
- Shideok.
- Yeah.

425
00:31:29,298 --> 00:31:31,917
That lady handles accounting here, right?

426
00:31:35,375 --> 00:31:40,001
You weren't going to say
she's pretty, were you?

427
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:45,022
Director Kim.
How have you been?

428
00:31:45,107 --> 00:31:48,708
Ahh... Annoying people
straight from the morning.

429
00:31:48,897 --> 00:31:52,578
Hey... Gangmo.
There... Look.

430
00:31:53,199 --> 00:31:55,459
I bought some makgeolli.

431
00:31:55,573 --> 00:31:58,392
Come here and have some.

432
00:31:59,252 --> 00:32:01,588
<i>Do you call that shoveling?</i>

433
00:32:01,701 --> 00:32:03,082
Move.

434
00:32:38,085 --> 00:32:41,375
There must be an account
with all their dealings.

435
00:32:41,508 --> 00:32:44,401
If we find that, we can stop them.

436
00:32:44,487 --> 00:32:46,882
I know, I do know...

437
00:32:46,991 --> 00:32:49,729
But where can you start looking from?

438
00:32:58,765 --> 00:33:00,486
Look at that mountain of rice.

439
00:33:00,675 --> 00:33:02,585
It's as high as Namsan.

440
00:33:02,708 --> 00:33:05,488
<i>Guess she eats three meals at once.</i>

441
00:33:06,481 --> 00:33:09,448
I really hate fat women who eat all day.

442
00:33:09,561 --> 00:33:11,632
Right, so go hit on her.

443
00:33:13,154 --> 00:33:14,015
What?

444
00:33:14,129 --> 00:33:16,417
Just find out where the account is.

445
00:33:17,259 --> 00:33:18,969
Forget it!

446
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:24,220
Hey, can you do this to me?

447
00:33:28,823 --> 00:33:30,771
No way!

448
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:43,647
I can't.

449
00:33:53,783 --> 00:33:55,343
Excuse me.

450
00:33:58,038 --> 00:34:01,171
You're really charming when you eat.

451
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:08,405
Are you busy later this evening?

452
00:34:09,086 --> 00:34:10,268
Why?

453
00:34:11,678 --> 00:34:16,264
I have two tickets
for this really fun movie.

454
00:34:17,266 --> 00:34:21,313
You know, I have really high standards.

455
00:34:24,582 --> 00:34:28,384
Yes. I thought so myself.

456
00:34:29,929 --> 00:34:32,181
Aww... This is trouble?!

457
00:34:32,432 --> 00:34:35,188
Where do I find a partner now?

458
00:34:35,973 --> 00:34:40,266
Actually, there's this
school festival next week,

459
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:43,794
but I don't have a partner yet, so...

460
00:34:44,711 --> 00:34:48,021
So, are you a college student?

461
00:34:48,172 --> 00:34:49,326
Yes.

462
00:34:49,525 --> 00:34:50,962
Was it that obvious?

463
00:34:51,094 --> 00:34:54,524
I'm working part-time here
to pay my tuition fees.

464
00:34:56,236 --> 00:34:58,354
I thought so myself.

465
00:34:58,893 --> 00:35:01,607
Thought this line of work
didn't really suit you.

466
00:35:13,334 --> 00:35:15,427
- Left a grain on your lip.
- Where?

467
00:35:55,095 --> 00:35:57,124
See you tomorrow, Shideok.

468
00:35:57,235 --> 00:35:59,493
I really enjoyed myself today.

469
00:36:19,696 --> 00:36:21,228
Did you find out?

470
00:36:21,947 --> 00:36:23,772
Whatever, man...

471
00:36:25,833 --> 00:36:28,988
My first kiss, with someone like her?!

472
00:36:29,181 --> 00:36:31,701
You'll drive me crazy!

473
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:33,517
Where is the account?

474
00:36:33,906 --> 00:36:35,597
The account.

475
00:36:36,622 --> 00:36:39,167
In a safe box inside the office.

476
00:36:39,506 --> 00:36:42,647
And she said Director Kim
always keeps the keys on him.

477
00:36:42,732 --> 00:36:44,018
Happy now?

478
00:36:46,477 --> 00:36:48,453
I'm so pissed off I could explode,

479
00:36:48,567 --> 00:36:51,752
should we just go and
deal with the damned thing?

480
00:36:51,875 --> 00:36:56,203
If you act in a hurry and fail,
it'll give them a chance to hide the evidence.

481
00:36:56,785 --> 00:37:00,655
Let's come back once
the subway bid is over.

482
00:37:04,977 --> 00:37:10,150
Aww... My lips!
What the hell is this?!

483
00:37:34,861 --> 00:37:37,445
You've become a master sharpshooter.

484
00:37:37,888 --> 00:37:39,586
Director Jo.

485
00:37:40,067 --> 00:37:42,743
Don't you think he's a little wasted?

486
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:47,698
Using someone as skilled as
Lee Seongmo just to spy on me.

487
00:37:47,868 --> 00:37:50,658
It's a waste of state money, isn't it?

488
00:37:51,536 --> 00:37:55,662
Have you ever spied on Director Min?

489
00:37:55,888 --> 00:37:57,524
Never done so.

490
00:37:57,937 --> 00:37:59,454
Still an expert in wild conjecture, I see.

491
00:37:59,548 --> 00:38:02,629
I'd love to bury the hatchet with you,

492
00:38:02,718 --> 00:38:05,383
but you still seem
to think of me as a foe.

493
00:38:05,497 --> 00:38:10,111
My only foes are those who try
to bring harm to the president.

494
00:38:10,319 --> 00:38:12,050
That's a relief, then.

495
00:38:12,986 --> 00:38:15,272
I'm telling you just in case,

496
00:38:15,432 --> 00:38:17,844
but don't try to compete with me.

497
00:38:18,355 --> 00:38:21,371
Don't want to see you getting hurt.

498
00:38:23,128 --> 00:38:25,637
I'm thinking of leaving this place soon.

499
00:38:25,798 --> 00:38:32,408
Shouldn't people of remarkable patriotism
like you remain here to protect the KCIA?

500
00:38:39,246 --> 00:38:41,563
Seeing he's still as arrogant as ever,

501
00:38:41,723 --> 00:38:45,919
seems like Hong Gipyo still hasn't
mentioned the subway bid to him.

502
00:38:46,453 --> 00:38:48,774
It won't be easy to mention that.

503
00:38:49,001 --> 00:38:52,604
If Director Min ends up
abandoning him over this...

504
00:38:52,718 --> 00:38:56,325
Same goes for Min Honggi.

505
00:38:56,670 --> 00:39:02,273
Won't be easy for him to get rid of the
only money line for his entry into politics.

506
00:39:02,491 --> 00:39:05,224
Anyhow, if Manbo Construction
can win this subway bid,

507
00:39:05,375 --> 00:39:08,305
then it can only pave the way
for your future success.

508
00:39:22,667 --> 00:39:27,015
You said there was someone
you wished to kill, right?

509
00:39:28,997 --> 00:39:32,999
Seeing you practicing down at the
shooting range, your eyes were on fire.

510
00:39:34,049 --> 00:39:38,782
Still want to shoot a bullet
through your enemy's heart?

511
00:39:39,028 --> 00:39:41,089
Is that how I looked?

512
00:39:41,924 --> 00:39:47,652
Don't you think it's time for you
to tell me what's behind all this?

513
00:39:49,656 --> 00:39:52,744
Who is it,
this enemy you talked about?

514
00:39:54,294 --> 00:39:57,027
The man who killed my parents.

515
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:02,811
You can pay back gratitude when you want,

516
00:40:02,972 --> 00:40:05,506
but vengeance should be
served quick and cold.

517
00:40:06,574 --> 00:40:08,371
Tell me who it is.

518
00:40:13,648 --> 00:40:17,979
If it's troubling for you to
deal with, I can help you out.

519
00:40:24,518 --> 00:40:26,652
I'll just say I appreciate the support.

520
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:29,962
If you'll excuse me,
there is something I need to do.

521
00:40:36,589 --> 00:40:41,879
Sometimes, those eyes
of his frighten me.

522
00:40:42,011 --> 00:40:47,675
Still, when it comes to being loyal,
he's second to none.

523
00:40:48,955 --> 00:40:52,373
Right. I'm well aware of that.

524
00:41:01,407 --> 00:41:03,641
<i>You just wait, Jo Pilyeon.</i>

525
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:08,379
<i>I'll soon pierce
that black heart of yours.</i>

526
00:41:30,096 --> 00:41:31,837
<i>Who is it?</i>

527
00:41:33,966 --> 00:41:35,656
<i>Who is it?</i>

528
00:41:57,317 --> 00:42:00,282
<i>~ To Chairman Hong Gipyo ~</i>

529
00:42:26,035 --> 00:42:30,020
Chairman Hwang, you came here yourself?!

530
00:42:30,162 --> 00:42:31,401
You surprise me.

531
00:42:31,523 --> 00:42:37,383
You're acting as best man for
our Manbo Construction in this bid,

532
00:42:37,503 --> 00:42:39,730
of course I had to pay a visit.

533
00:42:41,727 --> 00:42:44,184
- Give it to him.
- Yes.

534
00:42:49,824 --> 00:42:54,202
Here's the bid Daeryuk Construction
will have to present.

535
00:42:57,035 --> 00:43:00,510
We'll be counting on you, Chairman Hong.

536
00:43:05,729 --> 00:43:07,394
Yes, Chairman's office.

537
00:43:07,609 --> 00:43:08,789
Yes.

538
00:43:09,375 --> 00:43:10,567
Chairman.

539
00:43:12,025 --> 00:43:16,846
- Yes.
- It's Miju. An envelope was just delivered.

540
00:43:17,025 --> 00:43:18,719
From where?

541
00:43:20,467 --> 00:43:24,639
All that's written on
the envelope is your name?!

542
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,148
I'll be there in a moment, Ma'am!

543
00:43:27,253 --> 00:43:29,776
No.
Yes.

544
00:43:30,012 --> 00:43:32,387
Yes, I will, Chairman.

545
00:43:34,504 --> 00:43:35,648
I'm coming!

546
00:43:35,743 --> 00:43:38,347
I said I'm coming.

547
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:43,347
You seem busy.

548
00:43:43,508 --> 00:43:46,165
I'll just get going.

549
00:43:48,094 --> 00:43:53,114
Do you know what I went through
to form this committee?

550
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:57,017
I pranced around all day trying
to convince those esteemed folks,

551
00:43:57,108 --> 00:43:59,770
as if I was licking their damned feet!

552
00:44:00,478 --> 00:44:02,833
And you want to take
all that away from me?

553
00:44:03,447 --> 00:44:07,833
Even if it ruins me,
I will never let that happen!

554
00:44:08,923 --> 00:44:10,604
Look, Chairman Hong.

555
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:16,731
You still don't seem
to get what's going on.

556
00:44:17,267 --> 00:44:19,540
It's not just for this subway bid,

557
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:27,115
you will never get your hands on future
construction bids without my consent.

558
00:44:28,164 --> 00:44:30,523
Just because of all
we went through together,

559
00:44:30,713 --> 00:44:33,001
I'll let Daeryuk Construction...

560
00:44:34,146 --> 00:44:37,427
stay afloat and sit at our table.

561
00:44:38,839 --> 00:44:40,343
Let's go.

562
00:44:50,305 --> 00:44:54,546
Take the phone right now,
and call Chairmen Baek, Jo and Cheon!

563
00:44:54,735 --> 00:44:57,355
I'll fight this to the
bitter end right here and now!

564
00:44:57,572 --> 00:44:59,615
You never know what he might scheme,

565
00:44:59,728 --> 00:45:01,431
so gather the committee members.

566
00:45:01,583 --> 00:45:03,474
There will be no need.

567
00:45:05,167 --> 00:45:07,455
My father is already meeting them.

568
00:45:08,992 --> 00:45:11,031
Director Jo?!

569
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:25,821
These days, the Inspection Department
is focusing on corporate corruption.

570
00:45:27,486 --> 00:45:31,135
Chairman Hwang Taeseop told me this.

571
00:45:31,503 --> 00:45:35,985
"Don't bother those
three committee members."

572
00:45:36,098 --> 00:45:39,181
"They're like brothers-in-arms to me."

573
00:45:40,965 --> 00:45:43,933
Taken that way, it does sound
like a token of friendship,

574
00:45:44,170 --> 00:45:50,846
but I believe there's no
friendship in business and politics.

575
00:45:51,999 --> 00:46:02,050
Are you by any chance aware of some
fatal weak spot Chairman Hwang is hiding?

576
00:46:03,227 --> 00:46:05,573
What weak spot could he possibly have?

577
00:46:05,696 --> 00:46:09,510
Nothing of that sort.

578
00:46:09,734 --> 00:46:13,251
We're simply moved by
a spirit of friendship.

579
00:46:13,403 --> 00:46:15,233
You can believe us, Director.

580
00:46:15,337 --> 00:46:21,130
So you have faith in
Chairman Hwang as well, is that it?

581
00:46:21,237 --> 00:46:22,609
Of course.

582
00:46:22,722 --> 00:46:27,271
The most important thing
in running a business is faith.

583
00:46:27,586 --> 00:46:28,424
Fine.

584
00:46:28,661 --> 00:46:31,952
So I trust there would be no reason
why that faith would be betrayed.

585
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:38,563
If any of you betrays Chairman Hwang,

586
00:46:38,771 --> 00:46:43,924
then I'll take that as a sign that
something else's going on, and dig into it.

587
00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:45,870
Is that clear?

588
00:46:50,988 --> 00:46:53,883
Here... Let's have a drink.

589
00:46:54,469 --> 00:47:00,186
Health and prosperity to you all.

590
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:02,333
You as well.

591
00:47:13,229 --> 00:47:17,262
I doubt any of the
committee members will come.

592
00:47:17,685 --> 00:47:19,860
Have you heard anything?

593
00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:25,128
Why did they suddenly betray me
and stick to Hwang Taeseop?

594
00:47:25,386 --> 00:47:27,684
Is there anything you know about that?

595
00:47:28,682 --> 00:47:30,673
Wouldn't it be one of the two?

596
00:47:30,985 --> 00:47:32,961
You either fell out of favor with them,

597
00:47:33,282 --> 00:47:38,447
or maybe Chairman Hwang
had very convincing "arguments."

598
00:47:49,248 --> 00:47:50,506
Yes.

599
00:47:50,771 --> 00:47:53,277
Could you pass me to
Chairman Hong Gipyo?

600
00:47:53,419 --> 00:47:55,452
Just a moment.

601
00:47:56,667 --> 00:47:58,202
Chairman.

602
00:47:59,541 --> 00:48:01,502
It's for you?!

603
00:48:02,146 --> 00:48:03,233
Me?

604
00:48:12,403 --> 00:48:13,481
Hello?

605
00:48:13,699 --> 00:48:17,718
Did you look at the envelope I sent you?

606
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,173
So you haven't yet.

607
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:30,225
Inside there is a plan
to stop Hwang Taeseop's bid.

608
00:48:30,969 --> 00:48:35,299
Did you just say
a "plan to stop his bid"?

609
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:39,365
Who are you?

610
00:48:39,970 --> 00:48:43,983
<i>Are you working for Director Min Honggi?</i>

611
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,130
I know no such person.

612
00:48:46,357 --> 00:48:49,156
<i>So why are you helping me?</i>

613
00:48:51,365 --> 00:48:57,578
Because my grudge against Hwang Taeseop
goes deeper than you think.

614
00:48:58,681 --> 00:49:01,181
That is all I will tell you.

615
00:49:10,742 --> 00:49:12,806
<i>Get off of me!</i>

616
00:49:12,986 --> 00:49:14,452
I said no! No!

617
00:49:14,565 --> 00:49:17,165
You're not touching my nails!

618
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:18,417
Take a look!

619
00:49:18,546 --> 00:49:21,512
You've let them grow for so long,
they look like a falcon's claws.

620
00:49:21,615 --> 00:49:22,959
A little longer and
you'll catch rats with them.

621
00:49:23,035 --> 00:49:25,248
You're looking down on me, aren't you?

622
00:49:25,352 --> 00:49:28,567
Just because those feet can't move!

623
00:49:32,907 --> 00:49:35,810
You said I received an
envelope, right? Where is it?

624
00:49:36,632 --> 00:49:38,226
It's this one.

625
00:50:16,664 --> 00:50:18,238
Hwang Taeseop...

626
00:50:19,425 --> 00:50:25,391
Is this all you used to
force them to betray me?

627
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:41,525
Fine...

628
00:50:41,912 --> 00:50:46,626
Let's see what happens when your
own weapon is pointed against you.

629
00:50:46,805 --> 00:50:49,718
Let's see how it'll taste like.

630
00:51:10,072 --> 00:51:11,926
You never know what might happen,

631
00:51:12,105 --> 00:51:14,753
so remain alert until the bid is over.

632
00:51:28,766 --> 00:51:31,326
Seems like we're a little early?!

633
00:51:31,542 --> 00:51:33,548
You said at four, right?

634
00:51:33,854 --> 00:51:35,004
Yes.

635
00:52:18,872 --> 00:52:20,057
How did it go?

636
00:52:20,218 --> 00:52:22,361
They all left their respective offices.

637
00:52:22,484 --> 00:52:25,813
So why isn't anyone showing up?

638
00:52:25,926 --> 00:52:27,118
There is no way they wouldn't.

639
00:52:27,222 --> 00:52:29,586
There are only ten minutes left!

640
00:52:30,021 --> 00:52:32,335
Something is going on.

641
00:52:40,938 --> 00:52:45,653
What could possibly be inside here?

642
00:52:46,973 --> 00:52:54,157
I'll bury into oblivion everything
I've seen there regarding you.

643
00:52:54,677 --> 00:52:57,807
Instead, from now on,

644
00:52:59,017 --> 00:53:02,402
we will return to the original
construction committee.

645
00:53:02,572 --> 00:53:05,683
But, like...

646
00:53:05,976 --> 00:53:09,002
Hwang Taeseop won't
take this lying down?

647
00:53:09,134 --> 00:53:15,160
So are you suggesting you're afraid
of Hwang Taeseop, but not of me?

648
00:53:15,368 --> 00:53:17,392
<i>Look, Chairman Hong.</i>

649
00:53:17,505 --> 00:53:20,595
Director Jo Pilyeon is
on Chairman Hwang's side.

650
00:53:20,711 --> 00:53:23,775
We were even intimidated by him.

651
00:53:24,919 --> 00:53:29,076
All it takes to catch a fox is a tiger.

652
00:53:30,466 --> 00:53:32,144
As for that issue,

653
00:53:35,243 --> 00:53:37,389
you can leave everything to me.

654
00:53:51,724 --> 00:53:57,823
Only Manbo Construction
has submitted a bid so far.

655
00:53:58,293 --> 00:54:00,080
In accordance with our regulations,

656
00:54:00,231 --> 00:54:06,100
I'm here to inform you
this bid has been nullified.

657
00:54:08,286 --> 00:54:12,593
<i>In a fortnight,
another bid is set to take place,</i>

658
00:54:12,759 --> 00:54:14,991
so I hope there will be
no further mistakes.

659
00:54:15,175 --> 00:54:16,754
If you'll excuse me.

660
00:54:24,310 --> 00:54:26,387
What is this?

661
00:54:27,833 --> 00:54:31,616
Find out where they are right now!

662
00:54:32,041 --> 00:54:34,510
<i>They're gathered at the Royal Club.</i>

663
00:54:37,708 --> 00:54:39,159
I just checked.

664
00:54:39,325 --> 00:54:42,190
They followed Hong Gipyo there.

665
00:54:42,574 --> 00:54:44,327
Hong Gipyo?!

666
00:54:44,828 --> 00:54:47,480
That fool...

667
00:54:48,492 --> 00:54:51,688
<i>~ By issuing this special order,
President Park... ~</i>

668
00:54:51,849 --> 00:54:59,304
<i>~ tried to curb the deviating
behavior of selected students, ~</i>

669
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:05,411
<i>~ but their demonstrations already spread... ~</i>

670
00:55:10,113 --> 00:55:11,400
Yes.

671
00:55:11,996 --> 00:55:13,717
Oh, Minwoo.

672
00:55:15,193 --> 00:55:16,384
What?

673
00:55:16,974 --> 00:55:18,529
Turn off the TV.

674
00:55:21,763 --> 00:55:23,496
What are you trying to say?

675
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:26,075
And how could you let this happen?

676
00:55:28,765 --> 00:55:31,385
All right, I'll be there in a moment.

677
00:55:32,368 --> 00:55:33,588
What is the matter?

678
00:55:33,777 --> 00:55:35,303
The bid failed.

679
00:55:35,395 --> 00:55:36,056
What?

680
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:38,761
Those committee fools
stabbed us in the back.

681
00:55:38,874 --> 00:55:40,593
Jaechun, follow me.

682
00:56:07,253 --> 00:56:10,477
How do you explain what happened?

683
00:56:10,676 --> 00:56:14,954
I'll have to go in and find out myself.

684
00:56:24,964 --> 00:56:26,376
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

685
00:56:26,490 --> 00:56:30,925
The chairman was adamant
not to let anyone in.

686
00:56:31,416 --> 00:56:33,306
Ehh Ehh...

687
00:56:33,505 --> 00:56:34,488
Move!

688
00:56:34,611 --> 00:56:37,524
What kind of retards
do I have to deal with?!

689
00:56:37,609 --> 00:56:41,458
If there's anything above your eyebrows,
can't you give it a test run?

690
00:56:41,543 --> 00:56:43,702
How dare you barge in here without...

691
00:56:45,896 --> 00:56:47,342
I ought to...

692
00:56:48,619 --> 00:56:50,075
Unless you want
another hole in your mugs,

693
00:56:50,170 --> 00:56:51,649
get the hell out of the way,
you third-rate thugs.

694
00:56:51,734 --> 00:56:54,302
That's not what I meant...

695
00:56:54,396 --> 00:56:56,632
I was just...

696
00:57:06,859 --> 00:57:09,151
Hey... Am I bleeding?

697
00:57:11,790 --> 00:57:13,710
Chairman Hong!

698
00:57:14,674 --> 00:57:19,327
Here you are, Chairman Hwang.

699
00:57:21,819 --> 00:57:24,401
I see you're here as well, Director Jo.

700
00:57:28,978 --> 00:57:33,083
I thought I made myself clear?!

701
00:57:34,010 --> 00:57:36,629
<i>Come on in, Director Jo.</i>

702
00:57:45,061 --> 00:57:50,290
And I'd heard you were going around
threatening respectable businessmen...

703
00:57:50,394 --> 00:57:51,892
So the rumors were true.

704
00:57:51,996 --> 00:57:56,251
Haven't you heard the president's speech?

705
00:57:56,468 --> 00:58:00,947
This doesn't seem like the place
a KCIA director should spend time at now?

706
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:02,989
What did you just say?

707
00:58:03,831 --> 00:58:05,807
Think all directors are the same?

708
00:58:05,930 --> 00:58:08,569
KCIA or Inspection Department...
What is the difference?

709
00:58:08,654 --> 00:58:09,287
What?

710
00:58:09,401 --> 00:58:13,580
When you were on your knees
begging for your life,

711
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:16,070
I should have dealt
with you once and for all.

712
00:58:16,174 --> 00:58:18,254
You son of a...

713
00:58:26,562 --> 00:58:29,490
Is that all someone exploiting
businessmen can say?

714
00:58:29,594 --> 00:58:31,854
You're the one who's exploiting them!

715
00:58:31,996 --> 00:58:35,841
While exposing this cesspool
of corruption is part of my job.

716
00:58:35,974 --> 00:58:37,647
- Got it?
- So?!

717
00:58:37,969 --> 00:58:39,577
You're going to expose my "corruption"?

718
00:58:39,681 --> 00:58:42,281
- Think I can't?
- Be my guest, you prick!

719
00:58:42,366 --> 00:58:44,376
Think you'll get away with it?

720
00:58:44,546 --> 00:58:47,695
Think I won't be able to get rid of you?

721
00:58:48,423 --> 00:58:51,429
- Don't let anyone in!
- Yes, Director.

722
00:59:05,767 --> 00:59:08,490
Reporters are waiting next door.

723
00:59:37,123 --> 00:59:39,402
<i>Chairman Hwang Taeseop!</i>

724
00:59:40,565 --> 00:59:45,359
Don't even think of intimidating
the committee members again.

725
00:59:45,596 --> 00:59:50,626
You might find yourself tied upside down
in an underground questioning room!

726
01:00:09,928 --> 01:00:11,816
Didn't you say it was a done deal?

727
01:00:11,910 --> 01:00:14,542
How on earth did you handle all this?

728
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:19,226
There must have been
a mistake along the way.

729
01:00:19,330 --> 01:00:20,800
A mistake?!

730
01:00:20,913 --> 01:00:25,899
Would that be an excuse,
after getting shot to death in battle?

731
01:00:28,917 --> 01:00:31,211
Whatever it takes,

732
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:33,266
you must win that bid.

733
01:00:33,426 --> 01:00:36,641
If you fail at the next bid as well,

734
01:00:36,777 --> 01:00:41,446
then you'll have to prepare
yourself for the repercussions.

735
01:00:47,384 --> 01:00:53,249
Think I'm doing all this to rescue you?

736
01:00:58,819 --> 01:01:02,356
Call for a meeting immediately.

737
01:01:05,231 --> 01:01:08,966
We're at a crucial moment.

738
01:01:09,209 --> 01:01:14,133
Our bid must be lower than
Daeryuk Construction whatever it takes!

739
01:01:14,940 --> 01:01:17,235
Were you able to cut construction costs?

740
01:01:17,415 --> 01:01:19,968
I'm still talking with
subcontractors about it.

741
01:01:20,112 --> 01:01:22,614
And how much longer
will you keep just talking?

742
01:01:22,742 --> 01:01:25,086
We need results here!

743
01:01:28,868 --> 01:01:32,623
Jeongyeon, give it up.

744
01:01:36,226 --> 01:01:41,606
Chief Jo, you keep looking into it
until you find a way to cut costs.

745
01:01:42,155 --> 01:01:43,980
<i>All bear this in mind.</i>

746
01:01:44,915 --> 01:01:49,805
If our bid can't beat Daeryuk
Construction's, it's all over for us!

747
01:01:50,136 --> 01:01:51,327
Is that clear?

748
01:02:10,065 --> 01:02:10,925
The boys?

749
01:02:11,738 --> 01:02:13,942
They're all waiting outside.

750
01:02:14,056 --> 01:02:16,307
We started this to help her out,

751
01:02:16,411 --> 01:02:18,397
and now things have
gone out of proportion.

752
01:02:18,918 --> 01:02:20,137
Tell me about it.

753
01:02:20,232 --> 01:02:23,182
If we could only prove that
Director Kim sold off those goods,

754
01:02:23,283 --> 01:02:26,667
then we could certainly deal with
the subcontractors' price-fixing.

755
01:02:26,950 --> 01:02:29,617
And we could also renegotiate estimates.

756
01:02:31,887 --> 01:02:33,060
Let's go.

757
01:02:35,939 --> 01:02:38,154
Gather all the subcontractors.

758
01:02:38,305 --> 01:02:39,884
Will be right on it, Chief.

759
01:02:42,732 --> 01:02:44,234
Hwang Jeongyeon.

760
01:02:46,484 --> 01:02:49,375
If you have any information
that could help us, share it.

761
01:02:51,956 --> 01:02:54,736
You must have at least achieved
something, all this time?!

762
01:02:55,266 --> 01:02:58,165
The subcontractors might
be engaging in price-fixing.

763
01:02:58,345 --> 01:03:00,775
It makes no sense that their
estimates would all be the s...

764
01:03:00,879 --> 01:03:03,602
You were so adamant
you'd succeed and cut costs,

765
01:03:04,258 --> 01:03:08,080
but all you achieve is forcing
subcontractors to get together and fix prices?

766
01:03:09,978 --> 01:03:12,108
You prance around without a clue,
moved only by pride,

767
01:03:12,222 --> 01:03:14,548
so these are the results.

768
01:03:45,410 --> 01:03:47,575
Yes...
Sure, you don't need to worry.

769
01:03:47,651 --> 01:03:54,800
Yes... If we stay united,
even Manbo Construction will be powerless.

770
01:03:55,301 --> 01:03:57,363
Who are you people?
Director!

771
01:03:58,933 --> 01:04:00,521
Who are you?

772
01:04:00,843 --> 01:04:03,434
You've been selling raw materials, right?

773
01:04:03,954 --> 01:04:06,110
Where is the account for all
those stolen goods you sold?

774
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:07,699
Stolen goods?!

775
01:04:07,860 --> 01:04:09,499
You must be out of your mind!

776
01:04:09,641 --> 01:04:11,797
I'll just call the police...

777
01:04:15,616 --> 01:04:17,168
Go ahead and call them.

778
01:04:17,329 --> 01:04:22,423
We'll see who they
put their cuffs on first.

779
01:04:36,512 --> 01:04:37,893
It's this one.

780
01:04:39,396 --> 01:04:42,775
What is wrong with you?

781
01:04:45,565 --> 01:04:47,872
That's an impressive list.

782
01:04:49,865 --> 01:04:54,009
The police will love
getting their hands on all this.

783
01:04:56,144 --> 01:04:58,444
Help me out just this once.

784
01:04:59,105 --> 01:05:01,865
You don't seem to be the police,

785
01:05:02,092 --> 01:05:04,691
so what is it that you want from me?

786
01:05:12,073 --> 01:05:14,202
The most important thing
for the both of us to convive...

787
01:05:14,355 --> 01:05:17,180
is to reduce the price of raw materials
in a way that satisfies us both.

788
01:05:17,298 --> 01:05:19,733
What else are you trying
to take away from us?

789
01:05:19,863 --> 01:05:21,589
Aren't you being excessive?

790
01:05:21,755 --> 01:05:23,729
<i>We need to make a living as well!</i>

791
01:05:23,871 --> 01:05:26,105
I'm still not done explaining.

792
01:05:26,282 --> 01:05:28,063
Please let me finish.

793
01:05:28,181 --> 01:05:29,954
We have nothing else to listen.

794
01:05:30,084 --> 01:05:34,718
You're just asking us to sacrifice
to benefit Manbo Construction!

795
01:05:34,824 --> 01:05:35,876
That's right.

796
01:05:36,006 --> 01:05:38,465
We can't go any lower
than this estimate!

797
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:40,994
We need to make it if
you want to survive as well!

798
01:05:41,112 --> 01:05:43,078
That's exactly what we should say.

799
01:05:43,235 --> 01:05:47,140
You need subcontractors
like us to survive!

800
01:05:47,247 --> 01:05:48,591
Isn't that right, gentlemen?

801
01:05:48,701 --> 01:05:51,052
That's right.

802
01:05:51,809 --> 01:05:55,451
What are you wasting our time for?

803
01:05:55,576 --> 01:05:57,868
Let's just all go.

804
01:06:14,904 --> 01:06:17,153
I think all the directors present today...

805
01:06:17,898 --> 01:06:24,868
will have to renegotiate their deals
with Manbo Construction from scratch.

806
01:06:25,341 --> 01:06:27,481
What is he talking about?

813
01:06:51,392 --> 01:06:54,501
Find Daeryuk Construction's bid price.

814
01:06:54,607 --> 01:06:59,062
Gangmo, you find out Daeryuk
Construction's bid price.

815
01:06:59,338 --> 01:07:02,384
I want to be nominated for
the next congress election.

816
01:07:02,549 --> 01:07:05,552
<i>Chairman Hwang will
support my candidacy,</i>

817
01:07:05,705 --> 01:07:07,644
<i>since we're about to become in-laws.</i>

818
01:07:07,774 --> 01:07:10,859
You can try everything in your power,
but you won't get what you want.

819
01:07:10,989 --> 01:07:15,367
<i>Bear that in mind,
as you'll soon find out what it means.</i>

820
01:07:15,968 --> 01:07:18,785
Gangmo...
Close an eye just once.

821
01:07:18,975 --> 01:07:20,771
<i>Chairman Hong gave him
the bid agreement?</i>

822
01:07:20,878 --> 01:07:25,356
Does this guy who took the document
have something against Chairman Hwang?

823
01:07:25,486 --> 01:07:28,843
<i>He sent Chairman Hong's
housemaid to do it.</i>

824
01:07:29,008 --> 01:07:32,152
If you turn and see my face,
it will be the last thing you see.

825
01:07:32,282 --> 01:07:35,911
<i>I must see that face of yours.</i>
