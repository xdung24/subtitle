Episode 45

4
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:38,688
Hyung.

5
00:00:39,316 --> 00:00:40,953
I must be late by now?

6
00:00:41,058 --> 00:00:42,495
You came in this state?

7
00:00:42,591 --> 00:00:45,900
I told him to just watch her on TV 
at the hospital, but he's so stubborn...

8
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:47,599
Let's go in, Hyung.

9
00:00:49,072 --> 00:00:51,304
Jo Minwoo is here.

10
00:01:00,504 --> 00:01:04,334
<i>Yes, and with that we conclude 
Hong Jiyoung's performance.</i>

11
00:01:05,682 --> 00:01:07,925
Good luck on your debut.

12
00:01:13,465 --> 00:01:16,002
Cha Soojeong, you're next.

13
00:01:16,096 --> 00:01:17,853
Hurry up!

14
00:01:22,656 --> 00:01:25,085
<i>Here... Shall we find out, then?</i>

15
00:01:25,213 --> 00:01:30,530
<i>Dancing, singing, and a pure image
to boot, she's got them all.</i>

16
00:01:30,746 --> 00:01:35,370
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, please
welcome newcomer Cha Soojeong.</i>

17
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:39,260
<i>"Under the Spotlight."
Give her an applause.</i>

18
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,206
Stop there.

19
00:02:14,764 --> 00:02:19,050
If she dances with those clothes on,
the pin won't help much?!

20
00:02:19,607 --> 00:02:24,035
What if she ends up 
half-naked on live TV?

21
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,065
Cha Soojeong! Cha Soojeong!

22
00:04:49,151 --> 00:04:52,220
Cha Soojeong! Cha Soojeong!

23
00:04:57,294 --> 00:05:00,051
Soojeong!! That was great!

24
00:05:00,165 --> 00:05:02,993
It was awesome.

25
00:05:05,093 --> 00:05:08,818
You better not scare me
over stuff like that again.

26
00:05:09,246 --> 00:05:11,418
Yes, Director.

27
00:05:12,098 --> 00:05:15,332
Refuse any interviews 
and leave right away.

28
00:05:15,775 --> 00:05:18,232
For the time being, 
no further exposure.

29
00:05:18,346 --> 00:05:21,131
All right, Director.

30
00:05:24,997 --> 00:05:26,839
- You looked so cool out there!
- Thanks...

31
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:29,282
Soojeong.
You were the best tonight!

32
00:05:29,339 --> 00:05:31,811
The best!

33
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:54,620
He's going to meet Miju, isn't he?

34
00:05:55,681 --> 00:05:57,402
Let's just stay out of this.

35
00:05:58,933 --> 00:06:01,233
Miju can take care of this by herself.

36
00:06:01,923 --> 00:06:03,288
Let's trust her, uh?

37
00:06:03,359 --> 00:06:06,002
I don't think we'll get to meet her here.

38
00:06:06,213 --> 00:06:07,623
Let's go.

39
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,054
<i>You always have my support.</i>

40
00:06:17,147 --> 00:06:19,274
<i>Congratulations on your debut.</i>

41
00:06:21,517 --> 00:06:24,630
Who could this be?
He's not even leaving a name.

42
00:06:25,922 --> 00:06:27,491
Seonhwa.

43
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:30,644
Did two men come looking for me, 
by any chance?

44
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,284
Two men?

45
00:06:33,043 --> 00:06:34,515
Not really?!

46
00:06:34,793 --> 00:06:36,277
Why are you asking?

47
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,925
Haven't you read the sign outsid...

48
00:06:47,847 --> 00:06:48,599
Miju!

49
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,995
<i>It's Mi...Minwoo!</i>

50
00:07:04,232 --> 00:07:05,794
Miju.

51
00:07:08,254 --> 00:07:09,804
I have nothing to say to you.

52
00:07:09,933 --> 00:07:11,672
Please, leave.

53
00:07:12,177 --> 00:07:14,409
Can you leave us alone a moment?

54
00:07:14,644 --> 00:07:15,748
Yes...

55
00:07:16,112 --> 00:07:19,842
- Don't leave, Seonhwa.
- A moment will do.

56
00:07:21,156 --> 00:07:25,688
I'll be waiting outside, so have a talk.

57
00:07:34,475 --> 00:07:36,089
Lee Miju.

58
00:07:36,701 --> 00:07:38,790
Didn't you miss me?

59
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:43,125
- All this time...
- I've long forgotten you.

60
00:07:43,424 --> 00:07:46,484
Look at me. Say it to my face.

61
00:07:48,589 --> 00:07:52,454
And it's time you forget me as well.

62
00:08:05,595 --> 00:08:08,496
- Miju...
- Don't touch me.

63
00:08:15,607 --> 00:08:17,299
Let go!

64
00:08:19,108 --> 00:08:21,739
I thought something terrible 
had happened to you.

65
00:08:22,314 --> 00:08:23,982
If anything happened to you,

66
00:08:24,065 --> 00:08:30,342
I would have never
forgiven myself or my father.

67
00:08:34,852 --> 00:08:36,779
Miju...

68
00:08:40,796 --> 00:08:43,850
I've just become a singer.

69
00:08:44,014 --> 00:08:46,246
And today was my debut performance.

70
00:08:46,493 --> 00:08:49,497
You acting like this is only going
to make things awkward for me,

71
00:08:49,581 --> 00:08:50,573
do you know that?

72
00:08:50,644 --> 00:08:52,664
I have no intention of
causing you any trouble.

73
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,953
On the contrary, 
I'll give you everything you want.

74
00:08:56,024 --> 00:08:57,715
I can do that for you now.

75
00:08:58,366 --> 00:09:01,145
Miju, the director is on her way here!

76
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:08,240
The director is very strict 
about my personal life.

77
00:09:08,733 --> 00:09:14,766
I don't want her to
learn about you and me.

78
00:09:17,315 --> 00:09:22,049
Come to Hangang Hotel's 
restaurant at seven.

79
00:09:22,601 --> 00:09:24,543
I have no reason to meet you again.

80
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:26,254
Don't talk to me like that.

81
00:09:26,336 --> 00:09:28,838
It's been four years...
For the last four years!

82
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:32,773
There hasn't been a single day 
I haven't looked for you.

83
00:09:33,595 --> 00:09:36,062
And now that we finally meet,

84
00:09:36,191 --> 00:09:37,880
is that all you...

85
00:09:39,877 --> 00:09:42,481
If it's because of my father,
you don't need to worry.

86
00:09:42,607 --> 00:09:46,056
He doesn't dictate my life anymore.

87
00:09:46,631 --> 00:09:49,204
It's not because of your father.

88
00:09:50,038 --> 00:09:55,238
I don't have any feelings left for you.

89
00:09:57,376 --> 00:09:58,819
<i>Miju!</i>

90
00:09:59,138 --> 00:10:02,791
Are we clear now?
I don't love you anymore!

91
00:10:06,417 --> 00:10:08,285
But I still do.

92
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:15,274
My feelings for you
haven't changed at all.

93
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,271
<i>It's the Hangang Hotel.</i>

94
00:10:17,607 --> 00:10:19,784
I won't leave until you come.

95
00:10:36,388 --> 00:10:39,007
I'm sorry, Minwoo...

96
00:10:40,393 --> 00:10:43,142
It's not even your fault...

97
00:10:43,724 --> 00:10:45,614
I'm sorry.

98
00:10:46,448 --> 00:10:48,069
I'm sorry...

99
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:59,497
What were you doing
around Soojeong's waiting room?

100
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,874
So Cha Soojeong was
under contract with you?

101
00:11:04,984 --> 00:11:06,562
I asked you a question.

102
00:11:06,671 --> 00:11:08,811
I was impressed by her performance.

103
00:11:09,153 --> 00:11:10,808
See you again.

104
00:11:19,886 --> 00:11:23,186
What's going on between
Jo Minwoo and Soojeong?

105
00:11:23,327 --> 00:11:27,783
What could possibly be going on?
They just met for the first time.

106
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:36,745
Director.

107
00:11:36,859 --> 00:11:40,451
Miss Jeongyeon went to meet 
Congressman Jo Pilyeon.

108
00:11:41,156 --> 00:11:42,683
What?!

109
00:11:45,702 --> 00:11:50,165
I'm sure you're not thinking
I will give them back to you?!

110
00:11:50,397 --> 00:11:52,379
What did you really come here for?

111
00:11:52,491 --> 00:11:54,009
Was it to let bygones be bygones?

112
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:58,766
You will be forced to give that
pledge and the IOU list back.

113
00:12:05,643 --> 00:12:10,858
This is a list of all the bribe money...

114
00:12:11,563 --> 00:12:15,099
I paid to you during my tenure
as chairman of Manbo Construction.

115
00:12:27,215 --> 00:12:29,071
I see it's a copy.

116
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:31,818
So?

117
00:12:31,926 --> 00:12:35,640
I would like to exchange the list
and the pledge with the original.

118
00:12:35,749 --> 00:12:38,195
Or else you'll ruin the
both of us by leaking this?!

119
00:12:41,225 --> 00:12:42,959
But you know what?

120
00:12:43,409 --> 00:12:48,397
I knew you'd be writing something
like this from the very beginning.

121
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:52,238
Think I wouldn't have 
prepared a counterplan?

122
00:12:56,768 --> 00:13:00,175
All this time, I have been donating
a certain amount of money...

123
00:13:00,281 --> 00:13:03,182
to various coalitions under our names.

124
00:13:03,581 --> 00:13:08,221
It is likely the amount will
match the figures you listed here.

125
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:17,059
This brings Chairman Hong Gipyo to mind.

126
00:13:17,211 --> 00:13:22,638
<i>It was because of an account just like this 
that your son killed him, right?</i>

127
00:13:23,532 --> 00:13:28,246
I'm sure the statute of
limitations hasn't expired yet?!

128
00:13:29,233 --> 00:13:30,936
You motherless son of a bitch...

129
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:33,309
Calm down, Dad.

130
00:13:33,908 --> 00:13:37,624
You sure have two 
remarkable parents, Jeongyeon.

131
00:13:37,806 --> 00:13:42,969
Your father puts his life on the line for your
sake and threatens to reveal this account,

132
00:13:43,157 --> 00:13:48,337
and your mother gave up 
all that money for you.

133
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,207
Look!

134
00:13:50,336 --> 00:13:51,945
<i>Jo Pilyeon!</i>

135
00:13:52,391 --> 00:13:53,613
Why?

136
00:13:54,647 --> 00:13:57,278
She still doesn't know
who her real mother is?

137
00:13:57,744 --> 00:13:59,146
Let's just go, Jeongyeon.

138
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,778
What's that supposed to mean?

139
00:14:01,765 --> 00:14:05,657
My mother gave up 
all that money for me?

140
00:14:05,751 --> 00:14:09,380
Your birth mother 
is Director Yoo Gyeongok.

141
00:14:09,486 --> 00:14:13,092
So that's why Bucheol abducted you.

142
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:30,258
Why did you hide that from me?

143
00:14:31,342 --> 00:14:36,648
You know how long I've been looking for her.

144
00:14:37,115 --> 00:14:42,006
- So why...
- She struggled her whole life.

145
00:14:44,872 --> 00:14:50,111
Afraid her dark and shameful past
would become a burden to you,

146
00:14:54,739 --> 00:15:01,739
she always thought she
had no right to be your mother.

147
00:15:04,769 --> 00:15:10,420
She remained by your side,
hoping things would go well for you.

148
00:15:10,832 --> 00:15:18,960
And after witnessing you succeed,
she would then ask for forgiveness.

149
00:15:22,562 --> 00:15:24,335
Jeongyeon.

150
00:15:25,241 --> 00:15:30,996
Your mother cried even more.

151
00:15:31,924 --> 00:15:36,793
So much that you could see the
scars in her heart from a mile away.

152
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:41,691
Will you be able to forgive her?

153
00:15:44,228 --> 00:15:48,124
Can you accept her as your mother?

154
00:15:52,258 --> 00:15:54,244
No...

155
00:15:55,536 --> 00:15:57,368
I will keep waiting.

156
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:03,409
She wants me to succeed.

157
00:16:05,241 --> 00:16:07,966
So it is only if I succeed on my own...

158
00:16:09,364 --> 00:16:14,092
that she will be able to get
that burden off her shoulders.

159
00:16:15,994 --> 00:16:17,768
<i>Jeongyeon.</i>

160
00:16:19,201 --> 00:16:21,750
Pretend as if nothing happened as well.

161
00:16:23,147 --> 00:16:27,339
Let her do as she wishes.

162
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,252
That's what I want to do as well.

163
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:36,266
I will succeed right under her watch.

164
00:17:12,245 --> 00:17:13,443
Director.

165
00:17:13,738 --> 00:17:17,307
Noh Gapsoo is gathering
members for a meeting.

166
00:17:35,684 --> 00:17:37,188
Here...

167
00:17:38,398 --> 00:17:40,277
Let's begin.

168
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:43,754
The reason we gathered here today,

169
00:17:43,991 --> 00:17:45,929
as you well know...

170
00:18:10,146 --> 00:18:14,116
Who organized this meeting?

171
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:16,093
I did.

172
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:25,282
The only one who was
proclaimed as Baekpa's heir is me.

173
00:18:25,592 --> 00:18:28,571
- How dare you do this without my con...
- The reason we gathered here today...

174
00:18:29,632 --> 00:18:32,600
is to discuss a motion to expel
Director Yoo from the organization.

175
00:18:40,967 --> 00:18:44,773
There are only two days left until
the principal will have to be paid back.

176
00:18:44,937 --> 00:18:51,971
So I guess you forgot a certain pledge 
you signed, renouncing that principal?!

177
00:18:54,438 --> 00:18:59,318
Congressman Jo Pilyeon will soon join us.

178
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:04,099
Our organization will never
have to hang from her lips again.

179
00:19:04,334 --> 00:19:09,177
And you think I will take this lying down?

180
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:11,327
Starting today,

181
00:19:11,911 --> 00:19:14,110
Director Yoo is no longer
part of this organization.

182
00:19:14,698 --> 00:19:18,544
The principal under Director Yoo's control 
will be paid back by the four of us,

183
00:19:18,649 --> 00:19:23,536
so should anyone wish 
to join her, please rise.

184
00:19:24,475 --> 00:19:26,754
You are free to follow her out of here.

185
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:18,388
Baekpa tried his best to 
defeat me before his time came,

186
00:20:18,506 --> 00:20:20,774
but looks like I won instead.

187
00:20:22,865 --> 00:20:24,439
I recall telling him, back then.

188
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,274
That once he was dead,

189
00:20:26,386 --> 00:20:29,337
I'd get rid of every
single achievement of his.

190
00:20:37,968 --> 00:20:39,096
It's all right.

191
00:20:39,223 --> 00:20:41,010
I'm fine.

192
00:20:42,202 --> 00:20:44,029
It's my fault.

193
00:20:44,617 --> 00:20:48,792
Let me take responsibility for this.

194
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:53,549
Any problems within the organization
are for me to worry about.

195
00:20:54,123 --> 00:20:58,662
And your role is making Baekpa's
dream come true.

196
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:01,117
By Baekpa's dream...

197
00:21:01,528 --> 00:21:03,948
<i>{\a6}*"2nd financial circle" is Korean business lingo
for every financial institution other than banks</i>

198
00:21:01,528 --> 00:21:03,948
you mean creating 
another credit institution*?

199
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:07,613
A lot of preparation will be 
needed to be granted a permit.

200
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,343
So forget all the rest and
focus all your efforts on that.

201
00:21:11,434 --> 00:21:13,279
Yes, I will.

202
00:21:13,491 --> 00:21:18,271
I will succeed and create our
own credit institution at all cost.

203
00:21:25,482 --> 00:21:29,593
I will keep the pledge and the IOU list.

204
00:21:31,602 --> 00:21:34,081
I have no ulterior motives,
so you can rest assured.

205
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,512
I'm merely seeking mutual dependence.

206
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:42,472
All I want is a symbiosis between
politics and the financial world.

207
00:21:42,624 --> 00:21:46,599
Then, we'll be counting on you.

208
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:51,321
Instead, there is something 
you must do for me.

209
00:21:51,446 --> 00:21:53,208
Go ahead and tell us.

210
00:21:53,373 --> 00:21:56,755
The political situation 
is quite tense these days.

211
00:21:57,096 --> 00:22:00,326
Although I'm sure you're too concerned
with your business to worry about that.

212
00:22:12,696 --> 00:22:14,951
It's a list of opposition party members.

213
00:22:15,362 --> 00:22:19,549
<i>I hear you're pros at
hooking up with people,</i>

214
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,791
<i>so get acquainted with them.</i>

215
00:22:23,131 --> 00:22:25,069
Let's see you in action.

216
00:22:25,234 --> 00:22:26,937
Did I make myself clear?

217
00:22:47,706 --> 00:22:51,113
Miju should be here by now?!

218
00:22:57,481 --> 00:22:59,234
You shouldn't take it off already.

219
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:02,930
I haven't met her in years,

220
00:23:03,111 --> 00:23:05,436
so I don't want her to worry
on our first meeting.

221
00:23:05,671 --> 00:23:07,116
Will you be all right?

222
00:23:07,374 --> 00:23:08,702
Of course.

223
00:23:09,386 --> 00:23:12,358
She's my one and only sister, 
I need to endure it.

224
00:23:17,056 --> 00:23:18,325
Yes.

225
00:23:19,593 --> 00:23:21,344
<i>Tell me, Chanseong.</i>

226
00:23:22,885 --> 00:23:24,318
All right, fine.

227
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,174
Good job.

228
00:23:30,027 --> 00:23:31,425
What is it?

229
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:37,358
Jo Pilyeon completely gained control 
of the private lending cartel.

230
00:23:39,743 --> 00:23:41,916
It's not a good sign.

231
00:23:42,634 --> 00:23:45,463
We're about to go full force against him...

232
00:23:46,391 --> 00:23:47,718
What's that supposed to mean?

233
00:23:48,095 --> 00:23:50,071
You're going full force against him?

234
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:52,491
Never mind.

235
00:23:54,727 --> 00:23:56,590
Here's Miju.

236
00:24:03,514 --> 00:24:06,430
- See you tomorrow.
- See you.

237
00:24:17,648 --> 00:24:19,328
Aren't you coming in?

238
00:24:19,598 --> 00:24:22,009
Ohh... Go ahead first.

239
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:23,921
Don't make me wait.

240
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:42,573
Big Oppa...

241
00:24:45,509 --> 00:24:47,694
Little Oppa.

242
00:24:53,426 --> 00:24:56,020
It's been four years,

243
00:24:56,467 --> 00:24:59,462
but you two haven't changed a bit?

244
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:08,041
Don't hug him so hard.

245
00:25:08,112 --> 00:25:09,662
It's all right, Hyung.

246
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:15,641
You looked great on that stage today.

247
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:18,014
You were there?

248
00:25:18,117 --> 00:25:18,942
'Course...

249
00:25:19,047 --> 00:25:22,894
We saw our Miju's concert 
from beginning to end?

250
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:27,123
I thought you hadn't come,
and was so disappointed.

251
00:25:30,036 --> 00:25:33,922
- Hyung... Let's just go, shall we?
- Ohh... Sure, let's go.

252
00:25:34,053 --> 00:25:35,044
Are you going somewhere?

253
00:25:35,127 --> 00:25:39,084
Yeah... Heard Gangmo had
a gift for you or something?

254
00:25:39,193 --> 00:25:40,788
A gift?

255
00:25:42,257 --> 00:25:45,217
Here... Let's get going!

256
00:25:46,697 --> 00:25:49,410
Oppa, I'm scared.
Can't I open my eyes?

257
00:25:49,523 --> 00:25:51,533
Nope, no way.

258
00:25:52,501 --> 00:25:55,339
You must not open your eyes 
until I tell you.

259
00:25:55,492 --> 00:25:56,913
All right.

260
00:25:57,043 --> 00:26:00,475
What could it possibly be,
to have me keep my eyes closed?

261
00:26:00,582 --> 00:26:03,214
It's nothing special.
Don't expect too much.

262
00:26:04,306 --> 00:26:05,763
Yeah.

263
00:26:08,323 --> 00:26:09,897
You two are killing me!

264
00:26:09,979 --> 00:26:12,047
Here... careful.

265
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,645
Where are we?

266
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:16,160
- Can I open them now?
- Nah! Not yet.

267
00:26:16,231 --> 00:26:19,637
- Just a sec.
- Wait a moment.

268
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:23,455
<i>Not yet.</i>

269
00:26:26,615 --> 00:26:28,149
<i>Get ready.</i>

270
00:26:28,302 --> 00:26:31,885
<i>One... Two... Three!</i>

271
00:26:33,085 --> 00:26:34,680
<i>You can open them now.</i>

272
00:26:37,217 --> 00:26:39,144
Oh my...

273
00:26:42,904 --> 00:26:44,960
Congrats on your debut.

274
00:26:45,554 --> 00:26:47,168
This house...

275
00:26:48,425 --> 00:26:50,574
Miju, it's yours.

276
00:26:53,731 --> 00:26:58,638
<i>- Congrats on your debut,
Seongmo and Gangmo Oppa -</i>

277
00:27:06,592 --> 00:27:10,938
Gangmo built this apartment.

278
00:27:11,933 --> 00:27:13,120
Little Oppa...

279
00:27:13,226 --> 00:27:15,696
And all the furniture was picked by him.

280
00:27:16,119 --> 00:27:19,653
Toothbrush, soap, sofa, TV... All.

281
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:21,476
He bought them all.

282
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:29,792
Miju.

283
00:27:31,448 --> 00:27:33,747
So now don't ever leave us again,

284
00:27:33,935 --> 00:27:35,286
and live here.

285
00:27:35,518 --> 00:27:36,778
All right?

286
00:27:39,503 --> 00:27:44,096
I don't deserve any of this...

287
00:27:45,517 --> 00:27:48,815
You're our one and only sister.

288
00:27:49,213 --> 00:27:53,455
You're the apple 
of our eye to us, you know?

289
00:27:54,723 --> 00:27:59,375
Seongmo Oppa... Gangmo Oppa...

290
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:38,218
Chairman, we're about to close.

291
00:28:44,299 --> 00:28:48,185
<i>- Cheers!
- Cheers!</i>

292
00:28:51,459 --> 00:28:53,687
Aww... I'm so full.

293
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:57,604
It's the tenth toast, already.

294
00:28:57,763 --> 00:28:58,809
Really?

295
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:01,040
Have we already done that many?

296
00:29:01,416 --> 00:29:06,937
Looks like Gangmo is really happy 
you debuted as a singer.

297
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:10,520
Now all we need to do is finding Junmo.

298
00:29:10,719 --> 00:29:13,350
You still haven't heard a thing?

299
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:18,052
He might have been adopted again, 
away from the US.

300
00:29:18,181 --> 00:29:19,710
Again?

301
00:29:19,819 --> 00:29:20,566
Why?

302
00:29:20,707 --> 00:29:23,127
They say that if you don't
meet the right foster parents,

303
00:29:23,485 --> 00:29:25,511
it can happen at times.

304
00:29:26,228 --> 00:29:30,198
Our poor Junmo must 
be having it really hard.

305
00:29:30,929 --> 00:29:32,515
Ehh... You people!

306
00:29:32,597 --> 00:29:34,876
On such a nice day, 
what's wrong with you?

307
00:29:35,017 --> 00:29:36,579
Miju, don't you worry.

308
00:29:36,943 --> 00:29:40,361
Whenever it might be,
we will find him. All right?

309
00:29:40,432 --> 00:29:43,286
<i>Don't worry, we'll find him.</i>

310
00:29:46,858 --> 00:29:49,757
Wait a moment...
Let's change the mood a little.

311
00:29:56,666 --> 00:29:58,291
<i>What's that?</i>

312
00:30:03,448 --> 00:30:05,844
<i>Hyung! What are you, dancing?</i>

313
00:30:06,008 --> 00:30:08,710
<i>Don't tell me, Lee Seongmo is dancing!</i>

314
00:30:08,804 --> 00:30:11,698
<i>All right. You just wait.</i>

315
00:30:13,963 --> 00:30:16,614
Miju, take a look at how he dances.

316
00:30:17,589 --> 00:30:20,784
So you're telling me you won't
join your brother and dance?

317
00:30:20,866 --> 00:30:24,393
Young lady... May I?

318
00:30:24,451 --> 00:30:26,636
I'll let you dance instead.

319
00:30:30,113 --> 00:30:33,724
Lee Miju! Lee Miju!

320
00:30:39,998 --> 00:30:43,382
Did you practice it or something?

321
00:30:46,084 --> 00:30:47,545
Here!

322
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:39,313
I will never let you go.

323
00:31:42,816 --> 00:31:45,112
I'll make you...

324
00:31:47,966 --> 00:31:50,433
fall in love with me again.

325
00:32:43,205 --> 00:32:44,333
Yes.

326
00:32:44,561 --> 00:32:47,375
<i>Chairman, it's me. Director Moon.</i>

327
00:32:48,103 --> 00:32:50,724
Did you acquire the rest
of Beaute's core technology?

328
00:32:50,817 --> 00:32:52,125
Yes.

329
00:32:52,564 --> 00:32:56,682
But our contact would like
to be transferred to our company.

330
00:32:56,778 --> 00:32:59,709
Should he suddenly hand in his
resignation for no apparent reason,

331
00:32:59,833 --> 00:33:02,206
he might be accused 
of industrial espionage.

332
00:33:02,347 --> 00:33:06,353
<i>Even if he does transfer, 
make sure it's all handled with prudence.</i>

333
00:33:06,573 --> 00:33:07,657
Yes.

334
00:33:07,762 --> 00:33:09,571
All right, Chairman.

335
00:33:11,639 --> 00:33:14,488
<i>- Beaute Gas Boilers -</i>

336
00:33:17,034 --> 00:33:19,918
If you still haven't found
any mechanical defects,

337
00:33:20,092 --> 00:33:22,866
how about adding a mechanism to automatically 
force gas out of the exhaust pipe?

338
00:33:22,972 --> 00:33:24,393
That's not possible.

339
00:33:24,581 --> 00:33:25,345
It's not?

340
00:33:25,474 --> 00:33:27,677
This boiler shows no defects, 
I'm sure of that.

341
00:33:27,736 --> 00:33:32,152
Add a damper and you'll only be
admitting that there is a flaw.

342
00:33:32,352 --> 00:33:33,456
He's right, Gangmo.

343
00:33:33,585 --> 00:33:35,218
Not to mention that it would
damage the company's image.

344
00:33:35,289 --> 00:33:39,188
There's nothing worse for a company's
image than customers complaining.

345
00:33:40,386 --> 00:33:42,154
We need to avoid product
returns whatever it takes.

346
00:33:42,259 --> 00:33:47,768
That's going to cost us, and it's not
like we can raise prices to compensate.

347
00:33:47,886 --> 00:33:51,492
Until we find the reason, 
we'll have to bear the costs ourselves.

348
00:33:51,645 --> 00:33:53,610
You're peculiar, all right.

349
00:33:53,717 --> 00:33:57,036
- Are you going to lose money just to...
- You know, our president...

350
00:33:57,165 --> 00:33:59,561
is famous for his 
rather charitable nature.

351
00:33:59,725 --> 00:34:02,796
- To put it bluntly, he's a blockhead.
- Ehh! How dare you...

352
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,376
President, why don't you 
just fire his ass?

353
00:34:07,623 --> 00:34:11,550
Why didn't the factory manager 
come with you?

354
00:34:11,666 --> 00:34:14,801
I think he might be
thinking of leaving the company.

355
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,247
Leaving?

356
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,977
Are you telling me he
will hand in his resignation?

357
00:34:18,102 --> 00:34:22,081
Even I get the urge to quit because
we can't even find a little defect,

358
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:24,640
imagine how the 
factory manager would feel.

359
00:34:25,189 --> 00:34:26,939
<i>I'll get going.</i>

360
00:34:27,033 --> 00:34:29,746
Yes, we'll be counting on you.

361
00:34:32,918 --> 00:34:34,442
Now I've seen them all...

362
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:37,461
As if that mechanical defect was his fault, 
now he even hands in his resignation?

363
00:34:37,581 --> 00:34:40,886
He's really a honest man.
He sure earned my respect.

364
00:34:41,027 --> 00:34:43,921
The factory manager, along with
the technical director from earlier on,

365
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:48,774
are the best this field has to offer.

366
00:34:48,903 --> 00:34:51,885
We can't let him leave, Gangmo.

367
00:34:54,988 --> 00:34:56,432
Here, have a drink.

368
00:34:56,550 --> 00:35:01,227
Let's have a drink and forget
all our troubles for a moment.

369
00:35:01,369 --> 00:35:03,014
Why are you doing this?

370
00:35:03,121 --> 00:35:07,332
We've heard everything from Director Kim,
about you handing in your resignation.

371
00:35:07,445 --> 00:35:08,131
What?

372
00:35:08,237 --> 00:35:12,184
Ehh... Don't act like that,
and let's keep working together.

373
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:15,275
He's right. Manager.

374
00:35:16,673 --> 00:35:19,163
Gyeongja, can you do that to anyone?

375
00:35:19,234 --> 00:35:21,830
What's wrong with that? I respect him.

376
00:35:21,935 --> 00:35:25,671
If I raised your pay twofold, 
would you stay?

377
00:35:26,126 --> 00:35:29,326
Two... Twofold?!

378
00:35:30,313 --> 00:35:31,711
I apologize.

379
00:35:31,899 --> 00:35:34,768
- I will quit.
- It's twofold, twice the pay!

380
00:35:34,893 --> 00:35:37,361
I will add an apartment to that.

381
00:35:38,808 --> 00:35:41,242
Aren't you going overboard?

382
00:35:41,369 --> 00:35:42,759
Give that to me, uh?

383
00:35:42,818 --> 00:35:46,737
If you give that to me, 
I'll work until all my bones break, uh?

384
00:35:46,873 --> 00:35:49,512
I already made up my mind to leave.

385
00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:52,371
Wow... He's like a saint.

386
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,661
What are you, Buddha's
half-brother or something?

387
00:35:54,767 --> 00:35:56,913
I've heard your son was hospitalized,

388
00:35:57,829 --> 00:36:00,155
don't you need money?

389
00:36:01,612 --> 00:36:02,998
Feel free to speak.

390
00:36:03,714 --> 00:36:05,939
Where have you decided to transfer to?

391
00:36:06,063 --> 00:36:09,385
Tr...Transfer? I merely
wanted a little time off...

392
00:36:09,456 --> 00:36:11,653
<i>I will say it for you, then.</i>

393
00:36:12,627 --> 00:36:15,024
Isn't it Manbo Construction?

394
00:36:18,942 --> 00:36:22,909
How much of our boiler technology
have you leaked to them?

395
00:36:23,036 --> 00:36:25,254
What are you trying to insinuate?

396
00:36:25,361 --> 00:36:27,858
I know how hard things are for you.

397
00:36:28,774 --> 00:36:31,864
If you are honest with me, 
I will forgive you.

398
00:36:32,114 --> 00:36:35,098
If you have any evidence,
report me to the police!

399
00:36:35,273 --> 00:36:37,587
I will hand in my resignation.

400
00:36:40,817 --> 00:36:45,028
What the hell?! So he was a spy?

401
00:36:45,357 --> 00:36:50,366
With his family struggling so much,
the only reason why he'd decline such offer...

402
00:36:50,507 --> 00:36:51,667
He's a spy, all right.

403
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:53,955
What? So I respected him for nothing.

404
00:36:54,026 --> 00:36:56,798
That sorry-ass son of a cunt,
should we just report him?

405
00:36:56,868 --> 00:36:59,852
We have no evidence!

406
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,525
It's likely he already leaked
all our core technology to them.

407
00:37:19,321 --> 00:37:20,816
Chairman.

408
00:37:20,926 --> 00:37:24,061
The factory manager said he
just handed in his resignation.

409
00:37:26,191 --> 00:37:27,916
How could he quit already?

410
00:37:28,011 --> 00:37:30,928
He claims that Lee Gangmo
already found out about it.

411
00:37:31,571 --> 00:37:34,359
Looks like we'll have to take him in.

412
00:37:34,482 --> 00:37:36,352
People's eyes are on us, so not now.

413
00:37:36,457 --> 00:37:39,568
But his situation 
looked to be quite delicate?!

414
00:37:39,677 --> 00:37:41,909
He's the one who foolishly
handed in his resignation.

415
00:37:42,023 --> 00:37:43,146
Tell him to wait.

416
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:44,905
All right, Chairman.

417
00:37:45,106 --> 00:37:46,456
Right.

418
00:37:48,347 --> 00:37:51,530
About the model for our apartments.

419
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,640
Change it to Cha Soojeong.

420
00:37:54,752 --> 00:37:55,947
What?

421
00:37:58,261 --> 00:38:00,535
Yes. I will.

422
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:04,266
Director Yoo Gyeongok and I
are not exactly on good terms.

423
00:38:04,419 --> 00:38:06,407
So win over her road manager.

424
00:38:06,572 --> 00:38:10,025
I know what you're trying to say.

425
00:38:19,024 --> 00:38:22,657
So you want our Soojeong 
as model for your apartments?

426
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:24,157
Yes.

427
00:38:25,379 --> 00:38:28,973
For a debuting singer like her, 
it's a great honor!

428
00:38:29,983 --> 00:38:33,419
But... This contract.

429
00:38:33,668 --> 00:38:38,798
Could we set things in motion without
telling Cha Soojeong and Yoo Gyeongok?

430
00:38:39,198 --> 00:38:40,619
Excuse me?

431
00:38:44,278 --> 00:38:49,771
This is for you, on the side.

432
00:38:55,585 --> 00:39:00,656
<i>{\a6}- New Singer Cha Soojeong..
A Quiet Storm on the Horizon -</i>

433
00:38:55,585 --> 00:39:00,656
<i>Yes... She's not available that day,
but she can always shoot it on Tuesday.</i>

434
00:39:00,903 --> 00:39:03,382
You want her to sing as well?

435
00:39:03,699 --> 00:39:05,171
Yes.

436
00:39:07,986 --> 00:39:09,502
So Tuesday,

437
00:39:09,619 --> 00:39:14,092
recording at three.

438
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:16,965
So this is what being popular means.

439
00:39:17,058 --> 00:39:19,310
I can finally feel it!

440
00:39:21,471 --> 00:39:22,458
Soojeong!

441
00:39:22,552 --> 00:39:25,485
We're about to sign a contract
for an apartment CF!

442
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,505
An apartment CF?

443
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:29,489
Which company is it?

444
00:39:29,587 --> 00:39:30,289
Co...Company?!

445
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:34,081
Ohh... It's called Suyoung Construction.

446
00:39:34,217 --> 00:39:37,305
Suyoung Construction?
I never really heard it before?

447
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:39,803
Know how many construction firms 
there are in this country?

448
00:39:39,861 --> 00:39:41,706
How could you know them all?

449
00:39:41,823 --> 00:39:43,256
When are we signing?

450
00:39:43,385 --> 00:39:46,218
They'd like to sign today.

451
00:39:46,311 --> 00:39:49,056
Right... Your schedule
for the afternoon is full, right?

452
00:39:49,181 --> 00:39:50,117
Yes...

453
00:39:50,243 --> 00:39:51,420
Ahh... This is trouble.

454
00:39:51,538 --> 00:39:53,523
We might even lose this?!

455
00:39:53,617 --> 00:39:56,602
You can just go on her behalf.

456
00:39:56,713 --> 00:39:59,103
Still, I'd at least 
like to read the contract.

457
00:39:59,208 --> 00:40:01,064
It's just a one-year contract.

458
00:40:01,205 --> 00:40:03,297
And the director has given us her consent.

459
00:40:03,496 --> 00:40:06,691
I'll just go and sign for you.

460
00:40:08,148 --> 00:40:10,121
Go ahead, then.

461
00:40:10,227 --> 00:40:14,056
<i>- Aww... Congrats, Soojeong!
- Thanks.</i>

462
00:40:22,339 --> 00:40:23,836
How did it go?

463
00:40:24,106 --> 00:40:26,714
We signed a contract with Cha Soojeong.

464
00:40:27,172 --> 00:40:30,343
Have you found out 
whether she was dating anyone?

465
00:40:30,566 --> 00:40:33,409
She's not dating anyone
at the moment, either.

466
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:38,272
Also, here's today's schedule 
and her home address.

467
00:40:41,232 --> 00:40:45,591
I'd like to get her schedule 
from her manager every day,

468
00:40:46,167 --> 00:40:47,348
would that be possible?

469
00:40:47,453 --> 00:40:50,349
He is easily convinced,
with a little money on the side.

470
00:40:50,466 --> 00:40:52,463
I'm sure it can be done.

471
00:40:59,718 --> 00:41:02,301
<i>That's right.
All that land was sold already.</i>

472
00:41:02,454 --> 00:41:04,533
<i>The house as well.</i>

473
00:41:04,926 --> 00:41:08,793
She told me to find a three-room
house for just thirty million,

474
00:41:08,905 --> 00:41:11,396
but you call that easy?

475
00:41:12,946 --> 00:41:15,613
Our basement is empty,

476
00:41:15,707 --> 00:41:18,808
so she could move there,
and just pay a monthly rent...

477
00:41:18,878 --> 00:41:22,085
Aigoo, you brat.
What are you talking about?

478
00:41:22,943 --> 00:41:24,738
Drink it.

479
00:41:24,831 --> 00:41:26,842
It's citron tea.

480
00:41:29,497 --> 00:41:31,318
Where are you...

481
00:41:32,695 --> 00:41:34,597
Aigoo...

482
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:37,139
They said he's become 
addicted to gambling...

483
00:41:37,288 --> 00:41:40,258
He doesn't even know
what's happening to his mother.

484
00:41:40,493 --> 00:41:44,240
How can he find a house for that money?

485
00:41:44,369 --> 00:41:46,048
Tell me about it.

486
00:41:46,225 --> 00:41:50,310
That's why they should
have saved some while they had it.

487
00:41:52,817 --> 00:41:58,459
<i>Demonstrations supporting direct
presidential elections have been staged...</i>

488
00:41:58,882 --> 00:42:05,012
<i>all over the country, with the launching
of molotovs, fires and other acts of violence...</i>

489
00:42:05,176 --> 00:42:09,171
<i>continuing until the early morning.</i>

490
00:42:34,512 --> 00:42:36,473
Why didn't you tell me?

491
00:42:39,151 --> 00:42:42,809
Why did you let things get to
this point without saying a thing?

492
00:42:45,475 --> 00:42:47,038
If I told you,

493
00:42:47,763 --> 00:42:49,622
would it have made any difference?

494
00:42:49,869 --> 00:42:50,867
Mom.

495
00:42:51,072 --> 00:42:55,003
We can't live with just thirty million won.

496
00:42:55,187 --> 00:42:56,657
<i>Think about it.</i>

497
00:42:56,812 --> 00:42:59,945
Even if we get a place with that money,
how are we going to make a living?

498
00:43:00,056 --> 00:43:03,061
Worst comes to worst, we'd at least 
have to open a little mart...

499
00:43:03,736 --> 00:43:05,939
You really think you can live that way?

500
00:43:06,233 --> 00:43:10,149
So?! What am I supposed to do?

501
00:43:10,241 --> 00:43:14,005
So why did you waste 
your time with stocks?

502
00:43:16,073 --> 00:43:18,657
Just so that someone here
could finally bring home some money.

503
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:21,562
Since all you do is loaf all day.

504
00:43:22,701 --> 00:43:25,861
What are you going to do with
all the money we lost, anyway?

505
00:43:26,248 --> 00:43:28,139
Even if I have to 
live on ramen every day,

506
00:43:28,257 --> 00:43:31,886
as long as you wake up 
I'll be just fine, Jeongshik!

507
00:43:31,989 --> 00:43:40,272
It's because you're so clueless that you
let Jeongyeon's mother steal Dad from you!

508
00:43:45,892 --> 00:43:47,607
You...

509
00:43:48,582 --> 00:43:52,635
What did you just say?

510
00:43:54,174 --> 00:43:56,088
Jeongyeon's mother?!

511
00:43:56,298 --> 00:43:58,672
Yoo Gyeongok, that woman...

512
00:43:59,084 --> 00:44:01,733
is Jeongyeon's birth mother.

513
00:44:02,725 --> 00:44:06,913
<i>Dad has been deceiving us all along.</i>

514
00:44:08,181 --> 00:44:13,526
So how can I not feel sorry for you?

515
00:44:15,734 --> 00:44:18,824
So you want to live on ramen every day?

516
00:44:19,913 --> 00:44:21,972
And how are you going to
cope with the embarrassment?

517
00:44:22,113 --> 00:44:23,804
<i>After foolishly losing all our money,</i>

518
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:26,655
<i>letting her take away your husband 
and ending up on a street!</i>

519
00:44:26,962 --> 00:44:30,625
How are you going to endure all that?

520
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:40,077
What?

521
00:44:42,414 --> 00:44:44,329
That woman...

522
00:44:45,353 --> 00:44:48,558
is Jeongyeon's mother?!

523
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:53,167
Then,

524
00:44:55,281 --> 00:44:56,961
from the very beginning,

525
00:44:57,957 --> 00:45:00,097
I was nothing but a castoff?

526
00:45:01,982 --> 00:45:03,550
I...

527
00:45:04,725 --> 00:45:07,278
This Oh Namsuk...

528
00:45:09,205 --> 00:45:11,719
was nothing but a mistress?

529
00:45:41,646 --> 00:45:43,369
Those lights,

530
00:45:43,851 --> 00:45:48,173
the ones past the Han River.

531
00:45:48,782 --> 00:45:57,089
I likely built close to half 
the entire apartments in Gangnam.

532
00:45:58,376 --> 00:46:01,090
You miss those days?

533
00:46:02,329 --> 00:46:04,567
More than missing them,

534
00:46:05,013 --> 00:46:07,609
I should say I'm sad to have seen them go.

535
00:46:07,832 --> 00:46:13,115
Tear gas sweltered those 
streets once again today.

536
00:46:13,996 --> 00:46:16,850
But it's a concerto of
lights and glasses at night.

537
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:19,763
Isn't this country fascinating?

538
00:46:20,845 --> 00:46:22,723
We fight each other all day,

539
00:46:22,923 --> 00:46:26,518
<i>then we go out for drinks
and make up at night.</i>

540
00:46:28,609 --> 00:46:31,134
Jo Pilyeon is using the underground
market's resources to convince...

541
00:46:31,299 --> 00:46:35,151
congressmen from both sides to rally 
against the constitutional amendment.

542
00:46:36,197 --> 00:46:38,481
The situation is critical.

543
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:42,804
So give me that secret fund account.

544
00:46:43,414 --> 00:46:46,962
I'll meet Congressman Oh tomorrow,

545
00:46:47,283 --> 00:46:51,835
and go for broke to convince him.

546
00:46:52,109 --> 00:46:54,091
I'll bring it to you tomorrow.

547
00:46:54,279 --> 00:47:00,492
By the way, weren't
you and Min Honggi close?

548
00:47:01,291 --> 00:47:07,335
Maybe trying to convince him
instead could speed up things.

549
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,087
I don't trust Congressman Min.

550
00:47:10,427 --> 00:47:13,329
I've seen enough over the years
to convince me not to.

551
00:47:14,609 --> 00:47:16,428
Then again...

552
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:19,459
Be it Jo Pilyeon or Min Honggi,

553
00:47:19,637 --> 00:47:24,816
in the end all they care about 
is filling their pockets.

554
00:47:24,910 --> 00:47:30,985
Anyhow, you must 
convince Congressman Oh.

555
00:48:50,263 --> 00:48:53,396
<i>It was rewritten using
Jo Pilyeon's calligraphy.</i>

556
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:59,507
<i>When you meet Congressman Oh,
copy this and bring it to him.</i>

557
00:49:10,184 --> 00:49:11,304
<i>Seonbaenim.</i>

558
00:49:11,412 --> 00:49:12,016
Seonbaenim.

559
00:49:12,099 --> 00:49:13,637
This is serious.

560
00:49:15,189 --> 00:49:17,285
Looks like Congressman Oh Byeongtak, 
along with Jo Pilyeon,

561
00:49:17,391 --> 00:49:20,433
receives secret instructions
from the Blue House.

562
00:49:21,577 --> 00:49:22,818
What time is it?

563
00:49:22,910 --> 00:49:26,029
He already left to meet him.

564
00:49:26,452 --> 00:49:28,264
No way...

565
00:49:28,370 --> 00:49:31,463
He must not show that account to him.

566
00:49:41,232 --> 00:49:42,888
Chairman!

567
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:44,896
<i>Seongmo.</i>

568
00:49:46,717 --> 00:49:48,538
<i>What brings you here?</i>

569
00:49:51,114 --> 00:49:53,986
I was looking for some data 
at the congress library.

570
00:49:54,109 --> 00:49:55,546
Really?

571
00:49:55,669 --> 00:49:56,843
I'm a little busy.

572
00:49:57,043 --> 00:49:58,300
I'll leave you to your business.

573
00:49:58,417 --> 00:49:59,557
Yes.

574
00:50:15,473 --> 00:50:17,372
What's that supposed to mean?

575
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:21,464
So there is a secret fund account 
inside this briefcase?

576
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:24,904
I will just show it to you.

577
00:50:24,999 --> 00:50:26,255
Wait!

578
00:50:27,829 --> 00:50:29,262
You know what?

579
00:50:30,437 --> 00:50:31,917
I've been secretly 
ordered by the Blue House...

580
00:50:32,034 --> 00:50:37,351
to seek out all proponents and sympathizers 
of the constitutional amendment.

581
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:38,678
What?!

582
00:50:38,761 --> 00:50:42,743
If I ever open that briefcase,

583
00:50:42,986 --> 00:50:45,855
I'm afraid I won't be able to
let you walk out of here alive.

584
00:50:49,353 --> 00:50:53,836
You said you want to change the world?

585
00:50:56,216 --> 00:51:00,367
I'm sure what you want
is for that amendment to pass.

586
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:01,636
<i>Fine...</i>

587
00:51:01,706 --> 00:51:04,537
<i>I'm sure we will soon find out 
who will end victorious.</i>

588
00:51:05,289 --> 00:51:09,153
And should that be you,

589
00:51:09,494 --> 00:51:13,124
don't you ever forget that I
was the one who saved your life.

590
00:51:13,464 --> 00:51:14,919
Congressman Oh...

591
00:51:15,031 --> 00:51:19,993
I have no intention of running
against the tide of history,

592
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:22,916
and neither do I want to
turn my back on this regime.

593
00:51:23,655 --> 00:51:25,700
Am I making myself clear?

594
00:51:25,946 --> 00:51:32,087
This is what the politics you wanted
to join so much is all about!

595
00:51:43,375 --> 00:51:45,926
Did you show him the account?

596
00:51:49,849 --> 00:51:53,397
- Here... Let's save the details for...
- Chairman Hwang.

597
00:51:56,470 --> 00:51:58,402
What are you doing here?

598
00:51:58,524 --> 00:52:01,615
I came to meet Congressman Jo.

599
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:06,443
Chairman Hwang. Let's have a word.

600
00:52:19,061 --> 00:52:24,413
Actually, I am trying to
convince ruling party members...

601
00:52:24,495 --> 00:52:27,608
to vote in favor of
the constitutional amendment.

602
00:52:28,184 --> 00:52:30,427
Is that so?

603
00:52:31,092 --> 00:52:34,410
But none of them have any courage.

604
00:52:34,682 --> 00:52:40,354
We'd need a strong incentive 
to encourage them...

605
00:52:41,576 --> 00:52:49,548
For instance, that secret weapon
you mentioned some time ago.

606
00:52:52,161 --> 00:52:54,681
If my guess is right,

607
00:52:54,834 --> 00:52:59,168
it probably is an account for
the secret presidential fund?!

608
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:06,127
Most congressmen have
at least heard the rumors.

609
00:53:06,759 --> 00:53:11,484
The issue is whether
such a thing does indeed exist.

610
00:53:12,271 --> 00:53:18,870
With that account, would you be able to
gather all those approving the amendment?

611
00:53:19,032 --> 00:53:20,538
I certainly could.

612
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:23,545
Can you show me that account?

613
00:53:25,507 --> 00:53:27,114
Let's do this.

614
00:53:27,243 --> 00:53:30,426
First gather all those congressmen.

615
00:53:30,602 --> 00:53:35,865
Then I will come looking
for you with the account.

616
00:53:50,486 --> 00:53:53,112
That's Congressman Kwon Haeryong.

617
00:53:54,101 --> 00:53:58,021
<i>He's in his third term,
and comes from Masan.</i>

618
00:53:58,611 --> 00:54:00,723
<i>Thanks to his academic
and local affiliations,</i>

619
00:54:00,876 --> 00:54:04,482
many first-termers 
in the congress follow him.

620
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:10,432
<i>And I'm sure you know
Congressman Kang Changhwan quite well?</i>

621
00:54:12,042 --> 00:54:15,624
<i>They are men of great pride.</i>

622
00:54:15,835 --> 00:54:18,637
<i>Acting all tough and uncompromising
is embedded in their way of life.</i>

623
00:54:18,978 --> 00:54:22,736
If you'd been keeping a low
profile to learn who was who,

624
00:54:23,057 --> 00:54:25,509
I suggest you change your approach.

625
00:54:26,210 --> 00:54:27,999
Bear this in mind.

626
00:54:28,707 --> 00:54:33,057
You now hold the knife by the handle.

627
00:54:53,616 --> 00:54:55,102
My apologies.

628
00:54:55,212 --> 00:54:59,436
Looks like I lost my way 
while coming here.

629
00:54:59,675 --> 00:55:00,728
Yes.

630
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:06,360
So... Let's start by seeing that account.

631
00:55:06,474 --> 00:55:11,065
Before that, I have a request as well.

632
00:55:19,404 --> 00:55:22,071
<i>{\a6}- Agreement -</i>

632
00:55:19,404 --> 00:55:22,071
<i>I approve the constitutional amendment
to allow direct presidential elections</i>

633
00:55:25,207 --> 00:55:31,883
You will have to personally
sign those agreements.

634
00:55:32,786 --> 00:55:34,082
Look, Chairman Hwang!

635
00:55:34,191 --> 00:55:37,126
Don't you know that something
like this could get us killed?

636
00:55:37,218 --> 00:55:39,997
And the account you're
about to see is so dangerous,

637
00:55:40,244 --> 00:55:45,683
even a hundred of my lives wouldn't
be enough to cope with the repercussions.

638
00:55:45,859 --> 00:55:50,334
Shouldn't you prove
I can trust you as well?

639
00:56:04,225 --> 00:56:07,900
Faith is what we need here.

640
00:56:08,135 --> 00:56:12,775
And I have faith in our people.

641
00:57:22,881 --> 00:57:24,162
For dinner?

642
00:57:24,228 --> 00:57:28,342
Yeah... They want you tonight
at Hangang Hotel's restaurant.

643
00:57:28,448 --> 00:57:32,286
If it's an advertiser,
shouldn't you dress up tonight?

644
00:57:32,394 --> 00:57:35,083
Why are they suddenly
asking me out for dinner?

645
00:57:35,187 --> 00:57:40,058
Advertisers often like
to see their models firsthand.

646
00:57:40,187 --> 00:57:44,451
But, Manager... I couldn't
really check the contract.

647
00:57:44,639 --> 00:57:46,121
Haven't you checked your account?

648
00:57:46,231 --> 00:57:48,186
I'm sure they already wired some money?

649
00:57:48,399 --> 00:57:52,005
Check it. You should be
fifty million richer by now.

650
00:57:52,307 --> 00:57:53,998
Fifty million won?!

651
00:57:54,218 --> 00:57:56,504
She's a newcomer, 
and they pay her that much?

652
00:57:56,609 --> 00:57:58,914
It's because it's a two-year contract.

653
00:57:59,042 --> 00:58:00,364
What are you talking about?

654
00:58:00,490 --> 00:58:02,149
You said it was only a one-year contract.

655
00:58:02,231 --> 00:58:03,488
Soojeong...

656
00:58:03,582 --> 00:58:05,719
There's nothing like money 
in this business.

657
00:58:05,919 --> 00:58:09,572
Got to strike the iron while it's hot.

658
00:58:15,172 --> 00:58:16,744
<i>Hangang Hotel?</i>

659
00:58:16,934 --> 00:58:18,211
Yeah.

660
00:58:18,471 --> 00:58:20,080
I need to tell you something.

661
00:58:21,395 --> 00:58:22,781
I'll see you there.

662
00:58:23,604 --> 00:58:24,837
All right.

663
00:58:37,730 --> 00:58:40,405
Put those on.

664
00:58:45,127 --> 00:58:47,300
I can do it by myself.

665
00:58:50,427 --> 00:58:52,574
Just go home now, Jeongyeon.

666
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:13,495
Just for today...

667
00:59:14,917 --> 00:59:17,043
Just today.

668
00:59:18,881 --> 00:59:23,752
Then I won't do this again.

669
00:59:29,042 --> 00:59:34,353
I always liked your back so much.

670
00:59:40,270 --> 00:59:45,007
It's still as warm as I remembered it.

671
01:00:03,775 --> 01:00:06,312
Thank you for everything you did today.

672
01:00:06,949 --> 01:00:10,611
I owe you one again?!

673
01:00:12,303 --> 01:00:14,540
Careful on your way back.

674
01:00:16,354 --> 01:00:18,898
And you, recover quickly.

675
01:00:53,132 --> 01:00:54,459
You're here?

676
01:00:54,624 --> 01:00:57,126
What were you studying?

677
01:01:00,274 --> 01:01:04,631
I promised Director Yoo
we'd establish a credit institution.

678
01:01:04,902 --> 01:01:07,580
There's plenty to study.

679
01:01:09,636 --> 01:01:13,301
But, what did you want to talk about?

680
01:01:14,992 --> 01:01:21,107
I knew that Director Yoo 
was your mother.

681
01:01:22,916 --> 01:01:25,465
I got a call from Chairman Hwang.

682
01:01:26,757 --> 01:01:28,989
He said you're having it hard.

683
01:01:32,407 --> 01:01:35,161
I wonder if what I need 
is to be consoled,

684
01:01:35,784 --> 01:01:39,014
or just to be congratulated.

685
01:01:41,011 --> 01:01:44,899
Just tell Director Yoo first.

686
01:01:45,462 --> 01:01:48,629
I'll wait until she tells me.

687
01:01:49,815 --> 01:01:54,114
Just the fact I finally found
my mother makes me happy.

688
01:01:56,228 --> 01:01:57,838
Jeongyeon.

689
01:01:58,202 --> 01:02:01,743
Forget this place, and just
buy me soju at a stall outside.

690
01:02:02,013 --> 01:02:03,141
What?

691
01:02:04,045 --> 01:02:08,314
Just because you made a little money,
you start showing off with me?

692
01:02:09,871 --> 01:02:12,673
I already ordered.

693
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:11,120
Jo Minwoo.

<i>The Intelligence Department 
got a hold of this.</i>

702
01:03:49,887 --> 01:03:51,651
You must keep them quiet.

703
01:03:51,758 --> 01:03:54,192
Looks like they found out 
about our meeting.

704
01:03:54,316 --> 01:03:57,933
And who forced me to go all
through this just to meet you?

705
01:03:58,062 --> 01:03:59,389
<i>Then, there's only one way.</i>

706
01:03:59,471 --> 01:04:00,963
<i>Forcing you to hate me.</i>

707
01:04:01,057 --> 01:04:03,339
You really think I invested in you?

708
01:04:03,443 --> 01:04:04,800
<i>You still have a lot to learn!</i>

709
01:04:04,925 --> 01:04:07,623
- It's all we have.
- Just this once...

710

<i>If I make enough to open a store, 
I'll never gamble again.</i>

711
01:04:11,326 --> 01:04:12,616
<i>Give me that account.</i>

712
01:04:12,745 --> 01:04:13,837
I will do it.

713
01:04:13,955 --> 01:04:15,736
<i>Then, nothing will happen to you.</i>

714
01:04:15,867 --> 01:04:16,844
<i>Who did it?</i>

715
01:04:16,950 --> 01:04:19,605
<i>Who is accusing me of betrayal?</i>
