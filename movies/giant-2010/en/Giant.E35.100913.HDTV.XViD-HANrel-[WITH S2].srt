- Episode 35 -

4
00:00:09,641 --> 00:00:11,529
How is she...
Did the surgery go well?

5
00:00:11,656 --> 00:00:12,354
What?

6
00:00:12,441 --> 00:00:14,845
I'm Lee Miju's guardian.

7
00:00:15,091 --> 00:00:17,444
Ahh... Her.

8
00:00:17,569 --> 00:00:19,391
She said she couldn't do it, and left.

9
00:00:19,756 --> 00:00:20,860
What?

10
00:00:23,561 --> 00:00:25,022
Miju!

11
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:26,582
Miju!

12
00:00:27,688 --> 00:00:29,499
Miju!!

13
00:00:34,009 --> 00:00:36,161
Sorry...

14
00:00:36,502 --> 00:00:40,629
Big Oppa... Little Oppa...

15
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:56,547
Did Miju call?

16
00:00:56,677 --> 00:00:58,314
No.

17
00:00:58,671 --> 00:01:00,702
Did you find out where she could be?

18
00:01:00,817 --> 00:01:03,832
I asked her friends 
and looked everywhere...

19
00:01:04,038 --> 00:01:05,863
I have no idea 
where she might have gone.

20
00:01:05,942 --> 00:01:08,144
It's our fault.

21
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,331
She must have been 
shocked by all this.

22
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:13,344
Nah... I'm the only one to blame.

23
00:01:13,517 --> 00:01:16,752
I should have dealt with this
more carefully from the very start.

24
00:01:19,615 --> 00:01:20,252
Hello?

25
00:01:20,368 --> 00:01:22,072
Miju, is it you?

26
00:01:23,365 --> 00:01:24,517
It's you, right?

27
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,549
Answer me, Miju.

28
00:01:26,829 --> 00:01:29,125
<i>Sorry... Little Oppa.</i>

29
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,760
Miju!

30
00:01:31,556 --> 00:01:35,293
I've made you 
really angry, haven't I?

31
00:01:35,502 --> 00:01:37,147
No, Miju.

32
00:01:37,344 --> 00:01:38,494
It's all right.

33
00:01:38,595 --> 00:01:40,670
You didn't make us angry.

34
00:01:41,305 --> 00:01:42,564
Hello?

35
00:01:42,726 --> 00:01:44,013
Miju.

36
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,128
Where are you now?

37
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:47,199
We'll come to get you.

38
00:01:47,562 --> 00:01:50,704
<i>Give me some time.</i>

39
00:01:52,059 --> 00:01:54,021
All right, as you wish.

40
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,811
Going through that all alone
must have been scary.

41
00:01:59,121 --> 00:02:04,302
And we didn't even realize that...
I'm really sorry, Miju.

42
00:02:04,987 --> 00:02:07,034
I'm sorry, Miju.

43
00:02:07,373 --> 00:02:09,050
Don't be, Oppa.

44
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:12,855
I just need a few days on my own,
and then I'll come back strong as ever.

45
00:02:12,971 --> 00:02:16,094
<i>You can't even eat properly,
how can you remain all alone?</i>

46
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:23,252
I just wanted to be alone
for a few days, that's all.

47
00:02:23,542 --> 00:02:25,455
<i>All right, then.</i>

48
00:02:25,634 --> 00:02:29,656
<i>Instead, you must call us every day.</i>

49
00:02:29,815 --> 00:02:31,727
<i>Are we clear, Miju?</i>

50
00:02:32,015 --> 00:02:34,263
Yeah, Big Oppa...

51
00:03:14,355 --> 00:03:15,893
Jo Minwoo, that son of a bitch!

52
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,286
I won't let him get away with this.

53
00:03:19,111 --> 00:03:21,468
They just fell for each other.

54
00:03:21,715 --> 00:03:23,393
Hyung!

55
00:03:25,132 --> 00:03:29,375
If only for Miju's sake,

56
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:32,890
I think it would be better 
to just forget about it.

57
00:03:44,195 --> 00:03:48,329
<i>Dearest Manbo 
Construction shareholders.</i>

58
00:03:48,575 --> 00:03:52,668
<i>I am Chairman Hwang Taeseop.</i>

59
00:03:52,827 --> 00:03:56,940
<i>I'm rapidly recovering as we speak.</i>

60
00:03:57,549 --> 00:04:01,865
<i>I ask you to kindly cancel the
upcoming shareholders' meeting.</i>

61
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:07,707
<i>I will soon fully recover
and meet you in person,</i>

62
00:04:07,837 --> 00:04:12,892
<i>after which I will organize the
next shareholders' meeting firsthand.</i>

63
00:04:16,382 --> 00:04:18,032
<i>Mom!</i>

64
00:04:18,761 --> 00:04:21,089
Shareholders are storming
the offices with phone calls.

65
00:04:21,191 --> 00:04:23,005
They're asking whether the
meeting will really be canceled.

66
00:04:23,077 --> 00:04:24,583
Don't let this intimidate you.

67
00:04:24,685 --> 00:04:25,510
What do we do now?

68
00:04:25,597 --> 00:04:27,408
What do you think?

69
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,898
We'll present that
testament as planned.

70
00:04:31,385 --> 00:04:33,284
If he can manage to write letters,

71
00:04:33,383 --> 00:04:35,515
wouldn't it mean 
he has fully recovered?

72
00:04:35,615 --> 00:04:37,451
Your father hasn't recovered.

73
00:04:37,529 --> 00:04:39,206
And how do you know that?

74
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,480
He could have just shown up 
and it'd be the end of it,

75
00:04:41,596 --> 00:04:43,899
why threaten us with letters like this?

76
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:45,738
You don't need to worry.

77
00:04:45,912 --> 00:04:47,418
Ahh... But a look at that letter,

78
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:51,163
and it looks like he's about
to show up there for real?!

79
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:57,093
Bring me some water.

80
00:04:57,202 --> 00:04:59,550
What? Yes, Ma'am.

81
00:04:59,651 --> 00:05:03,330
I'll go meet my lawyer, 
so get the car.

82
00:05:03,446 --> 00:05:05,041
Yes, Ma'am.

83
00:05:08,633 --> 00:05:10,386
Hello?

84
00:05:10,641 --> 00:05:12,348
Chairman!

85
00:05:13,388 --> 00:05:15,382
Aigoo... 
Sure, everything is fine!

86
00:05:15,527 --> 00:05:17,649
Where are you now, Chairman?

87
00:05:19,674 --> 00:05:22,421
He...Hello?

88
00:05:23,652 --> 00:05:25,303
Is it you?

89
00:05:25,745 --> 00:05:27,021
Hello?

90
00:05:27,115 --> 00:05:29,761
Say something!

91
00:05:30,876 --> 00:05:33,263
Hello... Hello!

92
00:05:33,628 --> 00:05:34,483
Was it Dad?

93
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,800
Was it really him?

94
00:05:39,494 --> 00:05:43,171
Was that really the chairman's voice?

95
00:05:43,402 --> 00:05:46,218
Yes... Without a doubt.

96
00:05:46,665 --> 00:05:48,544
Mom...

97
00:05:54,424 --> 00:05:56,351
Blow harder.

98
00:06:02,311 --> 00:06:04,136
<i>Give it another try.</i>

99
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:30,713
<i>You must eat this, Chairman.</i>

100
00:06:30,829 --> 00:06:33,687
Only then you'll get back on your feet.

101
00:06:41,074 --> 00:06:43,478
It's you.

102
00:07:06,238 --> 00:07:08,015
She must have gotten rid 
of that child, by now?!

103
00:07:08,203 --> 00:07:10,402
I escorted her to the hospital myself.

104
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,902
So, that Miju...
Where is she now?

105
00:07:13,998 --> 00:07:17,907
I witnessed her moving out of her house,
but don't know her new destination.

106
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,702
She won't ever show up 
before Minwoo again,

107
00:07:20,777 --> 00:07:22,995
so you don't need to worry.

108
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:26,485
All right. Good job, Seongmo.

109
00:07:27,133 --> 00:07:28,660
How is Minwoo doing?

110
00:07:28,754 --> 00:07:32,415
Looks like he hasn't come to work again.

111
00:07:32,712 --> 00:07:36,127
- I ought to just teach him...
- I think...

112
00:07:36,506 --> 00:07:37,974
it would be wiser to just
leave him alone for a few days.

113
00:07:38,045 --> 00:07:40,823
Is this the time?

114
00:07:43,225 --> 00:07:47,283
Seongmo, you go and
try to reason with him.

115
00:07:51,594 --> 00:07:54,315
Don't you even know 
where she moved to?

116
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,478
<i>No...</i>

117
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,262
<i>We're looking for her as well.</i>

118
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:00,646
But what happened to you two?

119
00:08:00,752 --> 00:08:04,170
You didn't break up, did you?

120
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:08,765
If you hear anything about her,
please give me a call.

121
00:08:16,584 --> 00:08:17,899
They did...

122
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:19,473
<i>They broke up, Eonni.</i>

123
00:08:19,556 --> 00:08:22,833
<i>I could barely recognize him.</i>

124
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:41,941
<i>Thanks to you,</i>

125
00:08:42,892 --> 00:08:46,065
<i>I found happiness for
the first time in my life.</i>

126
00:08:49,718 --> 00:08:52,373
I'll never let you go.

127
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:56,989
So don't even dream about leaving me.

128
00:08:57,189 --> 00:08:59,466
Minwoo...

129
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:04,517
To make you mine,

130
00:09:08,018 --> 00:09:11,320
there's nothing I can't do.

131
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:44,311
Miju!

132
00:10:44,891 --> 00:10:47,553
Hey... Lee Miju!

133
00:10:52,744 --> 00:10:56,043
I can't live without you.

134
00:10:56,795 --> 00:10:59,895
I said I can't live without you!

135
00:11:04,935 --> 00:11:08,059
Where on earth are you?

136
00:11:11,053 --> 00:11:13,400
Where have you gone...

137
00:11:13,952 --> 00:11:18,298
Miju... Lee Miju!!

138
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:39,740
<i>I can't meet you anymore.</i>

139
00:11:42,579 --> 00:11:47,810
<i>You even fell in love
with someone like me...</i>

140
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:51,775
<i>I'm sorry, Minwoo.</i>

141
00:11:51,963 --> 00:11:54,230
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

142
00:12:02,338 --> 00:12:05,823
<i>I love you, Minwoo.</i>

143
00:12:38,101 --> 00:12:41,102
Oppa!

144
00:12:41,373 --> 00:12:43,732
Oppa...

145
00:12:44,136 --> 00:12:47,517
<i>Gyeongja is here! I'm here!</i>

146
00:12:50,877 --> 00:12:52,239
Here...

147
00:12:52,357 --> 00:12:54,471
Let's have a toast.

148
00:12:55,389 --> 00:12:58,381
I hope you'll always work here 
with a smile on your face.

149
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:03,905
And that is because this will always be 
the base upon which we build.

150
00:13:04,313 --> 00:13:06,204
Let's all cheer.

151
00:13:06,298 --> 00:13:09,444
Here... To our Hangang
Construction's future!

152
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,198
Cheers, cheers, cheers!

153
00:13:25,058 --> 00:13:26,972
President...

154
00:13:27,317 --> 00:13:28,710
Let me pour you a drink.

155
00:13:28,804 --> 00:13:30,284
Thanks.

156
00:13:30,942 --> 00:13:32,638
All right.

157
00:13:35,276 --> 00:13:38,534
- Here...
- It's all right, I can handle it.

158
00:13:39,442 --> 00:13:41,412
Gyeongja?

159
00:13:46,599 --> 00:13:47,943
Tastes good?

160
00:13:48,072 --> 00:13:49,819
Have a drink, brother-in-law.

161
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:52,532
Ohh... Sure, go ahe...

162
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:58,006
You little prick,
how dare you say that?

163
00:13:58,194 --> 00:13:59,357
What... Brother-in-law?!

164
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:01,213
What's wrong with you?

165
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:04,196
<i>When did I ever call you that? When?</i>

166
00:14:04,289 --> 00:14:05,829
I'm completely innocent.

167
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,403
Did I call him that?

168
00:14:07,474 --> 00:14:10,070
Yeah... Heard it loud and clear.

169
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,984
And when did I 
ever say that, you fool?

170
00:14:12,055 --> 00:14:13,194
"Fool"?!

171
00:14:13,323 --> 00:14:15,468
Finding any excuse to
call me that, you twat?

172
00:14:15,562 --> 00:14:16,960
Did I just call him fool, 
brother-in-law?

173
00:14:17,042 --> 00:14:20,474
Here he goes again
with that "brother-in-law"!

174
00:14:21,905 --> 00:14:23,761
Ohh... President Lee.

175
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:25,617
Seonsaengnim.

176
00:14:27,768 --> 00:14:30,906
Here's how Manbo Construction's 
stocks are faring.

177
00:14:37,061 --> 00:14:39,058
They keep falling non-stop?!

178
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:44,882
And these are the Manbo Construction
shares I bought with the money you gave me.

179
00:14:46,193 --> 00:14:47,062
Good job.

180
00:14:47,156 --> 00:14:53,817
But why did you buy so many
shares in Hwang Taeseop's name?

181
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,371
It's a long story.

182
00:14:58,297 --> 00:14:59,719
What on earth is going on here?

183
00:14:59,813 --> 00:15:01,998
The meeting is being postponed?

184
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:06,238
Here's the letter I
received from Hwang Taeseop.

185
00:15:11,124 --> 00:15:15,557
<i>If you go ahead and
reveal that forged testament,</i>

186
00:15:15,698 --> 00:15:19,891
<i>you can consider yourself dead!</i>

187
00:15:20,067 --> 00:15:25,147
<i>You better not take my warning lightly.</i>

188
00:15:26,784 --> 00:15:30,434
Is this really 
Chairman Hwang's handwriting?

189
00:15:30,526 --> 00:15:31,513
Yes.

190
00:15:31,646 --> 00:15:35,156
It perfectly matches 
his original testament.

191
00:15:35,274 --> 00:15:36,695
So, what,

192
00:15:36,836 --> 00:15:38,974
are you telling me you
won't disclose the testament?

193
00:15:39,068 --> 00:15:44,867
If we do that now,
the repercussions could be fatal.

194
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:47,712
A Hwang Taeseop on the brink 
of death suddenly disappears,

195
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:50,331
and now blackmail?!

196
00:15:51,353 --> 00:15:54,689
Doesn't this smell a little strange?

197
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:09,127
<i>So how about it?</i>

198
00:16:09,409 --> 00:16:11,664
This is a fake.

199
00:16:11,782 --> 00:16:15,975
<i>A meticulously devised forgery.</i>

200
00:16:19,914 --> 00:16:22,694
I don't know who's 
helping Chairman Hwang,

201
00:16:22,835 --> 00:16:25,489
but he's quite the resourceful fella.

202
00:16:31,985 --> 00:16:35,778
Everything is going fine here, 
so don't you worry.

203
00:16:36,181 --> 00:16:38,897
You know the shareholders'
meeting has been postponed, right?

204
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,136
Thank you for all the help, Ajeosshi.

205
00:16:42,805 --> 00:16:45,659
I'll be there in a moment.

206
00:16:56,869 --> 00:17:01,066
<i>What is Jeongshik's mother
trying to kill the chairman for?</i>

207
00:17:01,277 --> 00:17:06,669
I heard she was going to fix his
testament, but that's all I know.

208
00:17:11,724 --> 00:17:12,918
<i>Don't worry.</i>

209
00:17:13,047 --> 00:17:15,690
They're just supplements.

210
00:17:37,671 --> 00:17:38,775
The chairman?

211
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:41,489
He's completely lost all motivation.

212
00:17:42,154 --> 00:17:43,439
<i>Gangmo...</i>

213
00:17:43,602 --> 00:17:49,064
Can't we tell Jeongyeon
about you helping the chairman?

214
00:17:49,165 --> 00:17:52,560
I'm not doing this for Jeongyeon's sake.

215
00:17:52,746 --> 00:17:54,851
Don't tell her.

216
00:18:28,564 --> 00:18:30,373
Take it.

217
00:18:31,606 --> 00:18:34,942
They're the Manbo
Construction shares I've bought.

218
00:18:36,857 --> 00:18:41,623
Jo Pilyeon is taking away
your fortune behind your back.

219
00:18:41,731 --> 00:18:46,063
And this is what I bought
with the money I stole from him.

220
00:18:47,204 --> 00:18:49,399
If you feel wronged,
then get back on your feet.

221
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:54,404
Do it, and protect Manbo
Construction from Jo Pilyeon.

222
00:18:54,827 --> 00:18:56,566
<i>Gangmo...</i>

223
00:18:56,695 --> 00:18:58,762
<i>It's over for me.</i>

224
00:18:58,938 --> 00:19:01,464
<i>Just resign yourself.</i>

225
00:19:01,869 --> 00:19:05,020
You might have given up 
on this, but I can't!

226
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:10,235
I can't let Jo Pilyeon gain
control of Manbo Construction!

227
00:19:32,156 --> 00:19:34,564
<i>Harder! Don't let go!</i>

228
00:19:36,802 --> 00:19:38,651
<i>A bit more...</i>

229
00:19:52,826 --> 00:19:55,481
I've managed to stop them from 
revealing that testament for now,

230
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:58,092
but I won't last long.

231
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,909
If you want to show up
before them in good shape,

232
00:20:02,062 --> 00:20:07,219
you must shed ten, a hundred
times more sweat and tears.

233
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,547
This letter was sent from Gangnam?

234
00:20:16,642 --> 00:20:18,399
That's right.

235
00:20:20,091 --> 00:20:22,464
Search all the 
rehab centers in Gangnam.

236
00:20:22,553 --> 00:20:24,526
All right, Ma'am.

237
00:20:34,256 --> 00:20:37,723
<i>Dearest Director Yoo Gyeongok.</i>

238
00:20:37,852 --> 00:20:41,505
<i>I am proposing to cancel the
upcoming shareholders' meeting.</i>

239
00:20:41,634 --> 00:20:44,254
<i>I plan to organize another
meeting once I can stand before...</i>

240
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:47,343
<i>you all after a full recovery, so...</i>

241
00:20:47,449 --> 00:20:51,397
<i>I ask you to kindly give me some time.</i>

242
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,394
Yes?

243
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:59,021
I'm sorry.
I'm a little late.

244
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,818
No.

245
00:21:02,533 --> 00:21:05,455
It's a letter the chairman sent to me.

246
00:21:10,565 --> 00:21:13,278
The meeting was postponed, after all.

247
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,700
But this letter is a fake.

248
00:21:16,857 --> 00:21:18,055
A fake?!

249
00:21:18,138 --> 00:21:19,700
I'm sure of it.

250
00:21:19,817 --> 00:21:21,744
And what makes you think that?

251
00:21:21,814 --> 00:21:25,576
If he was going to send me a letter,
he wouldn't have addressed me that way.

252
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:30,180
But there is no doubt that
this is my father's handwriting.

253
00:21:30,896 --> 00:21:33,269
What's the reason
you're so sure it's a fake?

254
00:21:33,351 --> 00:21:37,568
The chairman would have 
never called me "director."

255
00:21:37,662 --> 00:21:40,415
Then, what else would he call you?

256
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:43,800
He's always...

257
00:21:44,546 --> 00:21:46,912
called me Madam.

258
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:51,458
I'll just have to file
a missing report with the police.

259
00:21:51,629 --> 00:21:54,583
I think it would be wiser
to postpone that for a while.

260
00:21:54,783 --> 00:21:55,381
Still...

261
00:21:55,452 --> 00:21:57,966
I don't know who took the chairman,

262
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:01,431
but we're now sure
he's trying to help you.

263
00:22:02,053 --> 00:22:05,801
Does anyone capable
of this come to mind?

264
00:22:05,906 --> 00:22:08,629
No matter how hard I try,
I can't think of anyone.

265
00:22:08,734 --> 00:22:12,258
Who is trying to help me...

266
00:22:12,646 --> 00:22:17,201
Couldn't it just be
Hwang Taeseop's daughter?

267
00:22:17,427 --> 00:22:20,571
For that to be the case, this whole 
scenario feels a little strange.

268
00:22:20,669 --> 00:22:22,098
Strange?

269
00:22:22,286 --> 00:22:23,531
What makes you say that...

270
00:22:23,637 --> 00:22:28,018
All Hwang Taeseop needs to make
that testament useless is showing up.

271
00:22:28,147 --> 00:22:31,851
She could oust 
Hwang Jeongshik right away,

272
00:22:32,012 --> 00:22:38,615
why just buy time trying to stop 
it all by writing these letters?

273
00:22:40,107 --> 00:22:42,327
The only one who knows our plans 
and is trying to get in the way...

274
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:44,946
is Lee Gangmo...

275
00:22:46,132 --> 00:22:49,769
You're not telling me
he's behind this again...

276
00:22:49,852 --> 00:22:56,030
Wouldn't Lee Gangmo be the first to
wish for Manbo Construction's downfall?

277
00:22:57,984 --> 00:23:03,833
Whomever it might be, what's for sure
is that Hwang Taeseop is recovering.

278
00:23:03,946 --> 00:23:08,886
Jaechun, you go tell the lawyer
to go ahead with the meeting.

279
00:23:09,052 --> 00:23:11,013
All right.

280
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,042
Hyung.

281
00:23:23,345 --> 00:23:24,355
What's the matter?

282
00:23:24,508 --> 00:23:26,328
You didn't even call me.

283
00:23:30,819 --> 00:23:33,314
Have you heard of 
Chairman Hwang's disappearance?

284
00:23:33,407 --> 00:23:34,531
Yeah.

285
00:23:34,624 --> 00:23:39,746
Someone is using him 
to blackmail Jo Pilyeon.

286
00:23:40,568 --> 00:23:42,514
Is that what Jo Pilyeon told you?

287
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:45,486
That someone was 
using Chairman Hwang.

288
00:23:45,556 --> 00:23:47,530
By any chance,

289
00:23:48,187 --> 00:23:50,850
are you that "someone"?

290
00:23:51,052 --> 00:23:54,379
I'm asking if you're the one
who's taking care of Hwang Taeseop.

291
00:23:54,703 --> 00:23:56,413
What makes you think that?

292
00:23:56,497 --> 00:23:58,924
If you're indeed helping him,

293
00:23:59,319 --> 00:24:01,227
stop right now.

294
00:24:02,241 --> 00:24:04,205
It's not me, Hyung.

295
00:24:16,368 --> 00:24:18,865
I have no doubt that Jo Pilyeon 
is the one who's making sure...

296
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:23,362
Manbo Construction
doesn't resume its project.

297
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:27,508
Is there no other way 
to resume construction?

298
00:24:29,658 --> 00:24:31,326
That's surprising.

299
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:36,115
I thought you and Manbo Construction's
top brass were on bad terms?!

300
00:24:36,221 --> 00:24:38,241
I only want to compete 
with them honestly.

301
00:24:38,323 --> 00:24:39,873
Is that so?

302
00:24:40,825 --> 00:24:42,693
Interesting.

303
00:24:43,427 --> 00:24:50,715
Hwang Jeongyeon seemed to believe
you're the one behind all this?

304
00:24:53,276 --> 00:24:57,186
Looks like I should be the one
to clear this misunderstanding.

305
00:24:57,297 --> 00:24:58,456
No.

306
00:24:58,597 --> 00:25:00,650
There's no need for that.

307
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:21,582
<i>The fight is not over yet.</i>

308
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,482
It would be wise to abandon
all your illusions of victory.

309
00:25:25,576 --> 00:25:28,125
Agasshi, Gangmo is the one...

310
00:25:29,601 --> 00:25:31,962
You better wake up, 
Hwang Jeongyeon.

311
00:25:32,244 --> 00:25:33,113
What?

312
00:25:33,219 --> 00:25:39,186
Don't let anyone get his hands on Manbo
Construction before I bring you down.

313
00:25:39,597 --> 00:25:41,884
Take good care of it.

314
00:25:48,733 --> 00:25:51,082
Jo Pilyeon is keeping the
construction from resuming...

315
00:25:51,152 --> 00:25:53,713
to get his hands on the company.

316
00:25:55,765 --> 00:25:58,119
Go ask Commissioner Han
if you don't believe me.

317
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:00,903
He'll confirm what I just told you.

318
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,035
If what he says is right...

319
00:26:07,117 --> 00:26:11,182
Jo Minwoo hasn't
come to work again, has he?

320
00:26:11,323 --> 00:26:13,696
It's been a few days already.

321
00:26:17,384 --> 00:26:18,865
<i>Yes.</i>

322
00:26:30,898 --> 00:26:32,624
Minwoo...

323
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:35,467
Hey...

324
00:26:37,392 --> 00:26:38,931
Minwoo!

325
00:26:39,013 --> 00:26:41,533
Look at you...

326
00:26:42,686 --> 00:26:43,594
<i>This won't do.</i>

327
00:26:43,688 --> 00:26:45,873
Come back home with us.

328
00:26:48,433 --> 00:26:49,208
<i>Honey.</i>

329
00:26:49,314 --> 00:26:53,237
Call some of your men and bring 
him home even against his will,

330
00:26:53,343 --> 00:26:55,363
we can't leave him here any longer.

331
00:26:55,457 --> 00:26:57,711
Leave us alone.

332
00:26:57,982 --> 00:26:59,082
Honey...

333
00:26:59,209 --> 00:27:03,127
I just want to have a word with him, 
so don't worry and go.

334
00:27:07,008 --> 00:27:12,156
<i>Aigoo, look at what meeting
that wench has done to my son...</i>

335
00:27:12,251 --> 00:27:15,046
Ahh... It's so upsetting...

336
00:27:45,736 --> 00:27:52,790
I wished you'd just close this chapter
and come out of here on your own feet.

337
00:28:02,246 --> 00:28:04,665
I like that fire in your eyes.

338
00:28:04,865 --> 00:28:08,873
At times, hatred can become the 
perfect catalyst to achieve one's goals.

339
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:11,116
Dream on.

340
00:28:12,984 --> 00:28:19,010
I'm never going to let your goals...

341
00:28:21,732 --> 00:28:23,905
control my life again.

342
00:28:37,906 --> 00:28:40,067
<i>Take a look at this mirror.</i>

343
00:28:40,231 --> 00:28:42,933
See how pathetic and foolish you look.

344
00:28:43,126 --> 00:28:46,165
Why don't you look at it yourself?

345
00:28:47,117 --> 00:28:51,052
See how wicked 
and cruel you really are.

346
00:28:59,758 --> 00:29:04,527
Know what people the world likes
to call "villains" have in common?

347
00:29:04,692 --> 00:29:06,865
<i>They're exceptionally thoughtful.</i>

348
00:29:06,982 --> 00:29:09,931
Theirs is a reality that
is not made for everyone,

349
00:29:10,095 --> 00:29:13,623
and they merely live abiding by
their own personal set of values.

350
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:20,389
Weaklings and minions like to call them "evil" 
just to feel better about themselves.

351
00:29:20,554 --> 00:29:24,277
<i>So you still think you lost
your beloved because of me, I bet?</i>

352
00:29:24,865 --> 00:29:29,446
All I did was 
protecting my beloved son.

353
00:29:30,849 --> 00:29:33,462
That's the difference 
between you and me.

354
00:29:33,579 --> 00:29:36,539
That I succeeded in
protecting you, and you lost her.

355
00:29:36,633 --> 00:29:39,639
Because you still are no match for me.

356
00:29:49,118 --> 00:29:50,716
One day,

357
00:29:50,927 --> 00:29:55,708
old age will cause my downfall.

358
00:29:58,544 --> 00:30:03,954
And I wish the only man who
manages to bring Jo Pilyeon down...

359
00:30:04,412 --> 00:30:07,250
<i>will be you, Minwoo.</i>

360
00:30:10,307 --> 00:30:12,606
If you can't defeat me,

361
00:30:12,794 --> 00:30:16,823
you'll never gain what you
want for the rest of your days.

362
00:30:17,199 --> 00:30:19,627
Are we clear, son?

363
00:31:12,232 --> 00:31:16,801
I'll cover your ears,
so just close your eyes.

364
00:31:17,012 --> 00:31:20,830
Then, you'll suddenly feel at peace.

365
00:31:54,095 --> 00:31:55,922
Miju...

366
00:31:57,207 --> 00:31:59,164
Miju.

367
00:32:03,045 --> 00:32:05,094
Miju...

368
00:32:12,235 --> 00:32:14,303
Miju.

369
00:32:18,619 --> 00:32:20,827
<i>I'm sorry, Miju.</i>

370
00:32:21,457 --> 00:32:24,210
<i>I should have protected you.</i>

371
00:32:25,886 --> 00:32:27,664
<i>I'll get a hold of myself.</i>

372
00:32:27,969 --> 00:32:30,374
<i>I will find you again at all cost.</i>

373
00:32:30,574 --> 00:32:32,665
<i>And when that happens,</i>

374
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:36,471
<i>you won't have to 
witness me in this state.</i>

375
00:32:38,573 --> 00:32:40,582
<i>Miju, I'm sorry.</i>

376
00:32:42,397 --> 00:32:44,752
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

377
00:33:28,016 --> 00:33:30,165
Thank you.

378
00:33:59,922 --> 00:34:02,216
You have a guest, Ma'am.

379
00:34:11,269 --> 00:34:12,914
Miju...

380
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:16,310
Ma'am...

381
00:34:17,966 --> 00:34:20,092
How did you find this place?

382
00:34:20,198 --> 00:34:22,406
You wrote me that letter,

383
00:34:22,512 --> 00:34:25,681
saying you were moving here from Jeju.

384
00:34:25,946 --> 00:34:27,816
I'm so glad you came, Miju.

385
00:34:27,921 --> 00:34:31,116
I was just thinking of
how much I missed you.

386
00:34:31,234 --> 00:34:35,670
I'm relieved to see you in good health.

387
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:38,716
Did you already have lunch?

388
00:34:38,787 --> 00:34:40,423
I'm so hungry I could die.

389
00:34:40,514 --> 00:34:42,729
Will you cook me lunch?

390
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:52,663
Tell me...
Something is up, isn't it?

391
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,449
Why?

392
00:34:55,555 --> 00:34:56,800
Does it look that way?

393
00:34:56,894 --> 00:35:01,757
You'd always start eating non-stop
whenever something was up.

394
00:35:05,069 --> 00:35:07,674
Everything's fine.

395
00:35:10,406 --> 00:35:14,772
How did it go with that man?

396
00:35:17,722 --> 00:35:18,942
What?

397
00:35:19,127 --> 00:35:24,370
You said you fell in love with
someone in those letters you sent me.

398
00:35:24,523 --> 00:35:28,235
<i>That you might get married soon.</i>

399
00:35:34,835 --> 00:35:37,260
<i>Come here, Miju.</i>

400
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,408
Come on.

401
00:35:46,864 --> 00:35:49,247
I know...

402
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:52,709
Even if you don't tell me, 
I can imagine.

403
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,833
Must have been hard?

404
00:35:56,056 --> 00:35:58,632
And painful.

405
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:01,322
Ma'am...

406
00:36:01,451 --> 00:36:04,505
That's right...
Cry all you want.

407
00:36:04,717 --> 00:36:07,595
Let it all out, Miju.

408
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:23,149
Your guest is here.

409
00:36:26,262 --> 00:36:27,659
Come on in, Jeongyeon.

410
00:36:27,753 --> 00:36:29,656
You're a bit late.

411
00:36:33,803 --> 00:36:35,248
Have a drink.

412
00:36:36,756 --> 00:36:38,619
Don't you worry about a thing.

413
00:36:38,748 --> 00:36:42,716
You'll soon be able to
resume the construction.

414
00:36:44,224 --> 00:36:46,815
Chairman Hwang and I are on
the same boat for the long run,

415
00:36:46,909 --> 00:36:50,480
I can't possibly let this go on...

416
00:36:52,883 --> 00:36:58,098
So that's how you've been
deceiving my father all this time.

417
00:37:05,954 --> 00:37:10,641
You set your sights on Manbo
Construction from the very start.

418
00:37:10,888 --> 00:37:13,613
Starting with that 
contract marriage you wanted.

419
00:37:13,801 --> 00:37:17,325
Looks to me like you're
misunderstanding things?

420
00:37:17,395 --> 00:37:18,951
<i>Don't even dream of lying to me.</i>

421
00:37:19,021 --> 00:37:23,262
- Commissioner Han already told...
- Manbo Construction...

422
00:37:23,506 --> 00:37:25,493
was always mine to begin with.

423
00:37:25,716 --> 00:37:27,591
Say what?

424
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:31,472
It all started a long time ago.

425
00:37:31,774 --> 00:37:37,064
To save his company, Chairman Hwang 
killed Lee Gangmo's father,

426
00:37:37,249 --> 00:37:39,765
and seized some gold bars.

427
00:37:42,023 --> 00:37:44,099
But, you know what?

428
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:50,009
That gold was actually mine.

429
00:37:52,415 --> 00:37:57,198
Since I had no use for it right away,

430
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:59,663
I saved Manbo Construction instead.

431
00:37:59,816 --> 00:38:03,751
<i>That's when your father swore to me.</i>

432
00:38:03,986 --> 00:38:06,664
That he would support me like a 
loyal mutt for the rest of his days.

433
00:38:06,805 --> 00:38:10,353
That he'd devote 
his everything to help me.

434
00:38:12,552 --> 00:38:14,557
Are we starting to get it?

435
00:38:14,745 --> 00:38:19,244
He's merely giving Manbo Construction
back to its rightful owner,

436
00:38:20,148 --> 00:38:22,392
so no need to feel wronged, darling.

437
00:38:22,535 --> 00:38:24,930
I don't feel that way at all.

438
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:30,052
Because I'll never let you and
your son get your hands on that company.

439
00:38:31,626 --> 00:38:35,291
Will you really be able to?

440
00:38:35,928 --> 00:38:40,419
My father is not dead yet.

441
00:38:43,445 --> 00:38:45,293
You just wait.

442
00:38:45,458 --> 00:38:49,029
Dad will soon reveal the truth.

443
00:39:01,592 --> 00:39:04,204
Is this letter really a fake?

444
00:39:04,357 --> 00:39:06,941
But who made this forgery?

445
00:39:07,058 --> 00:39:08,632
Who do you think?

446
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:12,451
It's another one
of Jeongyeon's shenanigans.

447
00:39:16,084 --> 00:39:18,233
You know that...

448
00:39:18,569 --> 00:39:21,267
the shareholders' meeting is
going on as planned, right?

449
00:39:21,722 --> 00:39:22,845
So?

450
00:39:22,979 --> 00:39:26,136
If you can't resume
the construction by then,

451
00:39:26,229 --> 00:39:30,488
you'll have to renounce
all your company holdings.

452
00:39:38,186 --> 00:39:42,015
Things are finally
starting to go the right way.

453
00:39:43,155 --> 00:39:44,764
When I become chairman,

454
00:39:44,905 --> 00:39:48,394
I'll make you the happiest woman alive.

455
00:39:48,535 --> 00:39:50,778
Awww... My boy.

456
00:39:50,907 --> 00:39:53,223
I get teary-eyed just hearing that.

457
00:39:53,311 --> 00:39:56,169
Might not have been lucky at the altar,
but look at what boy Lady Luck gave me.

458
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:59,488
Aww... My cute boy...

459
00:40:00,003 --> 00:40:02,606
Mom...

460
00:40:12,087 --> 00:40:13,978
<i>Dad...</i>

461
00:40:14,554 --> 00:40:16,316
<i>Daddy.</i>

462
00:40:17,526 --> 00:40:21,066
<i>Where on earth have you gone?</i>

463
00:40:27,597 --> 00:40:30,161
I found where Chairman Hwang is.

464
00:40:30,604 --> 00:40:31,757
Get the car.

465
00:40:31,865 --> 00:40:33,000
Yes.

466
00:41:00,601 --> 00:41:02,257
<i>Get back up.</i>

467
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:05,635
I said get up!

468
00:41:06,874 --> 00:41:12,571
The only man I want to see in charge
of Manbo Construction while we fight...

469
00:41:12,689 --> 00:41:16,013
is not Jo Pilyeon, but you!

470
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:22,802
Give me a chance to beat
Manbo Construction in all fairness!

471
00:41:23,582 --> 00:41:26,319
Are you just going 
to accept this lying down,

472
00:41:27,458 --> 00:41:30,418
and take that 
opportunity away from me?

473
00:41:30,953 --> 00:41:32,767
<i>Uh?</i>

474
00:41:35,555 --> 00:41:41,106
After taking my father and
even Jeongyeon away from me,

475
00:41:42,095 --> 00:41:47,097
<i>you should at least
have done that much for me.</i>

476
00:41:49,936 --> 00:41:51,528
Forget it.

477
00:41:51,653 --> 00:41:54,006
Just give up, then.

478
00:41:56,913 --> 00:42:01,806
I'll never meet you again.

479
00:42:30,156 --> 00:42:32,420
This is only the beginning.

480
00:42:32,538 --> 00:42:35,627
<i>Don't pat yourself
on the back for so little.</i>

481
00:42:49,624 --> 00:42:52,946
So you still haven't
forgotten Hwang Jeongyeon?

482
00:42:53,771 --> 00:42:57,101
Is that the reason why
you're helping her father?

483
00:42:58,875 --> 00:43:01,036
Hwang Taeseop...

484
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:04,866
is the last man you should
forgive, Jo Pilyeon included.

485
00:43:05,089 --> 00:43:11,454
He betrayed and killed
a friend of his, our father.

486
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:17,245
On the contrary, this is the
perfect opportunity to get rid of him.

487
00:43:17,515 --> 00:43:19,465
<i>And you don't need to be the one.</i>

488
00:43:19,606 --> 00:43:22,805
- I'll take care of...
- I am well aware...

489
00:43:23,005 --> 00:43:25,049
of what I should do.

490
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:33,483
If only to bring Manbo Construction
down with my own hands,

491
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:39,023
I can never let Jo Pilyeon 
gain control of it.

492
00:43:40,469 --> 00:43:41,490
That is all.

493
00:43:41,607 --> 00:43:44,697
Even if your ultimate goal
is bringing down Jo Pilyeon,

494
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:48,551
if Hwang Taeseop will
gain anything from this,

495
00:43:48,915 --> 00:43:51,346
I'm against it.

496
00:44:05,383 --> 00:44:07,467
<i>Hwang Taeseop
Hwang Jeongyeon
Hwang Jeongshik</i>

497
00:44:55,557 --> 00:44:57,354
Thank you.

498
00:44:57,530 --> 00:44:59,833
For being alive.

499
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,427
Thank you so much.

500
00:45:22,792 --> 00:45:27,516
You don't need to worry now.

501
00:45:30,382 --> 00:45:34,536
If only for my daughter Jeongyeon,

502
00:45:34,928 --> 00:45:37,673
I will help you recover.

503
00:45:41,232 --> 00:45:46,323
But who has been looking 
after you all this time?

504
00:45:46,793 --> 00:45:51,115
Can you write who it is?

505
00:46:07,613 --> 00:46:12,717
So you were the one who's been 
taking care of the chairman?

506
00:46:14,127 --> 00:46:16,183
What is the reason?

507
00:46:16,324 --> 00:46:18,873
What were you looking
to accomplish by doing that?

508
00:46:18,978 --> 00:46:23,747
His recovery is going
better than expected.

509
00:46:24,781 --> 00:46:27,046
If everything goes according to plan,

510
00:46:27,811 --> 00:46:31,545
Hwang Jeongyeon will be able 
to protect Manbo Construction.

511
00:46:31,827 --> 00:46:36,690
Jeongyeon thinks that all
this happened because of you.

512
00:46:36,819 --> 00:46:41,001
It doesn't matter what she thinks.

513
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:45,629
I thought you two were in love?!

514
00:46:46,597 --> 00:46:48,260
Why are you doing this?

515
00:46:48,377 --> 00:46:51,431
Then, let me ask you something myself.

516
00:46:52,693 --> 00:46:57,033
Jeongyeon has been looking
for you so ardently over the years,

517
00:46:57,268 --> 00:47:02,237
so why don't you tell her 
you're her mother?

518
00:47:07,018 --> 00:47:09,731
Our reasons might be different,

519
00:47:09,954 --> 00:47:15,217
but know that mine is
just as good as yours.

520
00:47:15,534 --> 00:47:22,642
Jeongyeon can't learn I'm her mother.

521
00:47:23,523 --> 00:47:30,982
If you promise not to tell anyone
that I've been helping the chairman...

522
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:33,650
<i>Gangmo...</i>

523
00:47:33,744 --> 00:47:35,649
Ohh, Gangmo.

524
00:47:39,548 --> 00:47:40,429
It's all right.

525
00:47:40,523 --> 00:47:41,287
Go ahead.

526
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,280
This is serious, Gangmo.

527
00:47:43,374 --> 00:47:45,438
They're going on with
the meeting as planned.

528
00:47:45,556 --> 00:47:46,249
What?

529
00:47:46,354 --> 00:47:48,997
They found out the letters were forged.

530
00:47:49,127 --> 00:47:52,170
He can't even communicate properly...

531
00:47:52,282 --> 00:47:54,224
It's serious, all right.

532
00:47:56,708 --> 00:48:01,853
The only solution is Jeongyeon taking
the chairman to the meeting with her.

533
00:48:01,981 --> 00:48:04,108
Call her.

534
00:48:13,814 --> 00:48:14,848
Yes?

535
00:48:15,111 --> 00:48:17,140
<i>We found the chairman.</i>

536
00:48:17,425 --> 00:48:19,198
Where are you?

537
00:48:20,248 --> 00:48:25,745
Don't tell Jeongyeon I was
the one who's been helping you.

538
00:48:28,301 --> 00:48:33,261
You must protect
Manbo Construction at all cost.

539
00:49:11,152 --> 00:49:14,809
<i>- Yang -</i>

540
00:49:22,064 --> 00:49:24,216
Don't overdo it.

541
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:32,010
With all this willpower,
you'll recover in no time.

542
00:49:32,181 --> 00:49:33,683
<i>Gangmo...</i>

543
00:49:34,002 --> 00:49:35,576
<i>Your father's grave...</i>

544
00:49:35,633 --> 00:49:37,613
<i>is in Yangsuri.</i>

545
00:49:37,702 --> 00:49:39,890
When you've fully recovered,

546
00:49:40,059 --> 00:49:44,175
I'll come at you at full force.

547
00:49:44,466 --> 00:49:48,716
You'll have to give up 
that top spot to me.

548
00:49:48,829 --> 00:49:51,075
<i>Gangmo, you fool.</i>

549
00:49:57,386 --> 00:49:59,247
Jeongyeon will be here soon.

550
00:49:59,378 --> 00:50:01,079
I'll get going.

551
00:50:23,590 --> 00:50:24,490
Dad!

552
00:50:24,593 --> 00:50:26,059
Chairman!

553
00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:32,541
Dad...

554
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:36,676
Can you sit like this?

555
00:50:38,139 --> 00:50:39,781
It's not a dream, is it?

556
00:50:39,893 --> 00:50:42,224
It's real, right?

557
00:50:50,226 --> 00:50:52,255
Dad...

558
00:51:01,527 --> 00:51:03,284
<i>Dad...</i>

559
00:51:17,283 --> 00:51:21,418
You really don't know who's
been helping Dad all this time?

560
00:51:22,819 --> 00:51:24,247
I don't.

561
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:29,161
But why were you 
the first one he called?

562
00:51:29,638 --> 00:51:31,451
I wonder...

563
00:51:33,406 --> 00:51:38,274
But, will you let him stay here?

564
00:51:38,884 --> 00:51:43,279
Even if he's released,
there's really no place for him to go.

565
00:51:43,383 --> 00:51:46,127
And I don't want him
to face my stepmother.

566
00:51:47,405 --> 00:51:51,637
I have an empty apartment.

567
00:51:52,001 --> 00:51:53,834
I'll take care of him.

568
00:51:53,928 --> 00:51:56,587
I'll bring him there so
he can continue his treatment.

569
00:51:56,722 --> 00:51:58,923
Can you really do that for me?

570
00:51:59,016 --> 00:52:02,902
You'll be really busy until
the shareholders' meeting.

571
00:52:03,752 --> 00:52:05,979
Leave the chairman to me,

572
00:52:06,197 --> 00:52:07,840
and focus all your 
efforts on the company.

573
00:52:07,952 --> 00:52:10,687
I know how shameless it is,
but I'll be counting on you.

574
00:52:10,809 --> 00:52:13,087
Thank you, Director.

575
00:52:21,276 --> 00:52:24,637
Aigoo, who did you take after, 
being so radiant?

576
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:26,666
My mother?!

577
00:52:27,798 --> 00:52:29,880
Mister Yeom.
What are you waiting for?

578
00:52:30,002 --> 00:52:32,685
The chairman is leaving,
aren't you getting the car?

579
00:52:32,996 --> 00:52:35,281
Ch...Chairman?!

580
00:52:35,413 --> 00:52:39,839
Don't you know that Jeongshik is
becoming chairman starting today?

581
00:52:41,117 --> 00:52:43,015
Yes... I'll go get it.

582
00:52:43,132 --> 00:52:45,623
- See you later, Mom.
- Ohh... Right.

583
00:52:47,819 --> 00:52:49,344
And Jeongyeon?

584
00:52:50,293 --> 00:52:52,012
She left early in the morning?!

585
00:52:52,088 --> 00:52:56,066
Aigoo... The meeting's finally here,
so I bet that brat will be desperate.

586
00:52:56,179 --> 00:52:57,499
Get me an appointment 
at the beauty salon,

587
00:52:57,584 --> 00:53:00,224
and go get my clothes
from the dry cleaner's.

588
00:53:02,452 --> 00:53:07,434
Aigoo... That cunning wench...

589
00:53:28,239 --> 00:53:31,030
You will do just fine.

590
00:53:31,246 --> 00:53:33,745
I have faith in you.

591
00:53:45,993 --> 00:53:47,624
Come on in.

592
00:53:49,203 --> 00:53:51,214
How does he look?

593
00:53:52,624 --> 00:53:55,048
You look really great, Dad.

594
00:53:58,194 --> 00:54:01,624
But is he able to speak now?

595
00:54:20,274 --> 00:54:22,007
How are you?

596
00:54:33,269 --> 00:54:35,139
Hey... Lee Gangmo.

597
00:54:37,281 --> 00:54:39,161
What are you doing here?

598
00:54:39,321 --> 00:54:41,998
Bought myself some
Manbo Construction shares.

599
00:54:42,209 --> 00:54:45,409
So I hear they're proclaiming 
a new chairman today?

600
00:54:45,579 --> 00:54:46,556
Why...

601
00:54:47,251 --> 00:54:48,877
Here to congratulate me?

602
00:54:49,011 --> 00:54:50,641
Nah.

603
00:54:51,092 --> 00:54:53,713
I'll be the one to 
bring this company down,

604
00:54:53,987 --> 00:54:56,664
I should at least see who gets
the honor to lead it on the way out.

605
00:54:56,890 --> 00:54:58,177
What?!

606
00:55:04,344 --> 00:55:06,261
Lee Gangmo...

607
00:55:06,392 --> 00:55:08,886
The moment I become chairman,

608
00:55:08,998 --> 00:55:11,645
you'll be the first on my list.

609
00:55:16,794 --> 00:55:19,773
Mom... Isn't Jeongyeon coming?

610
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:22,325
Did she run away or something?

611
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:31,445
We will now begin this
shareholders' meeting.

612
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:33,485
As you've been informed,

613
00:55:33,598 --> 00:55:39,151
Chairman Hwang Taeseop's 
testament will be revealed today.

614
00:55:39,264 --> 00:55:44,656
But he's in good enough shape 
to send letters to us,

615
00:55:44,825 --> 00:55:48,189
<i>why are you revealing his testament?</i>

616
00:55:48,621 --> 00:55:51,769
Yes...
I will tell you why.

617
00:55:51,929 --> 00:55:57,010
After employing a specialist
to verify their authenticity,

618
00:55:57,230 --> 00:56:00,205
he confirmed to us that 
those letters were a forgery.

619
00:56:06,798 --> 00:56:13,001
This is an adjudication of incompetence 
acknowledged by the court.

620
00:56:13,253 --> 00:56:19,316
As a result, a new chairman must be 
proclaimed to fill the vacant post.

621
00:56:27,002 --> 00:56:31,738
Mister Kim, if you could
please reveal the testament.

622
00:56:41,710 --> 00:56:43,617
I will announce it.

623
00:56:44,679 --> 00:56:47,857
I, Hwang Taeseop, transfer
possession of all my company shares...

624
00:56:47,979 --> 00:56:51,043
<i>to my son Hwang Jeongshik.</i>

625
00:56:52,001 --> 00:56:56,108
<i>Also, all personal and
real estate in my possession...</i>

626
00:56:56,249 --> 00:56:59,538
<i>will go to my wife, Oh Namsuk.</i>

627
00:57:00,243 --> 00:57:02,416
<i>Accordingly, for being the
company's largest shareholder,</i>

628
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:10,756
Hwang Jeongshik will be proclaimed
the new chairman of Manbo Construction.

629
00:57:10,972 --> 00:57:12,795
That is all.

630
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:31,751
Then, we will now hear the
new chairman's proclamation speech.

631
00:57:31,841 --> 00:57:35,071
No matter if it's what
the chairman's testament states,

632
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:40,582
wasn't Director Hwang
Jeongyeon the company heir?

633
00:57:42,481 --> 00:57:46,596
Including Park Gidong's five percent,

634
00:57:46,709 --> 00:57:50,936
Hwang Jeongshik now holds
55 percent of company shares.

635
00:57:51,297 --> 00:57:56,424
You can force another voting out of this,
but the result won't change.

636
00:57:57,879 --> 00:58:01,645
<i>Chairman, if you will.</i>

637
00:58:11,909 --> 00:58:16,554
I'm Manbo Construction's
chairman, Hwang Jeongshik.

638
00:58:23,684 --> 00:58:28,175
To help restore faith in the eyes of
the fellow shareholders who supported me,

639
00:58:28,269 --> 00:58:34,008
I will not merely stop at making Manbo
Construction the leading company in our country,

640
00:58:34,416 --> 00:58:40,592
but the world leader in our sector,
fulfilling our...

641
00:58:43,556 --> 00:58:47,758
Fulfilling our noble aspirations!

642
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:22,986
Can you...

643
01:00:23,926 --> 01:00:27,250
really do this to me up to the end?

644
01:00:31,361 --> 01:00:33,064
Honey...

645
01:00:38,373 --> 01:00:40,722
Why can't you answer me?

646
01:00:41,616 --> 01:00:43,565
<i>Maybe you really can't?!</i>

647
01:00:51,528 --> 01:00:56,171
As everyone can see, the chairman...

648
01:00:56,531 --> 01:00:59,063
<i>is perfectly fine.</i>

649
01:01:06,928 --> 01:01:09,712
I'll ask the lawyer, then.

650
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:15,532
The chairman was curious why
the testament presented today...

651
01:01:15,823 --> 01:01:21,922
was so different from
the one he personally wrote.

652
01:01:30,955 --> 01:01:38,498
Maybe the lawyer and Oh Namsuk
plotted together to fix it?

653
01:01:39,511 --> 01:01:40,927
Director Hwang.

654
01:01:41,068 --> 01:01:42,948
<i>Enough with the nonsense.</i>

655
01:01:43,171 --> 01:01:49,467
Shouldn't the chairman ask
that kind of question firsthand?

656
01:01:57,857 --> 01:02:00,037
Go ahead and say it.

657
01:02:01,098 --> 01:02:04,588
Do you really think the lawyer and I...

658
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:09,448
fixed that testament?

659
01:02:22,699 --> 01:02:23,921
Take a look.

660
01:02:24,097 --> 01:02:26,993
He can't say a word.

661
01:02:29,312 --> 01:02:31,203
Director Hwang.

662
01:02:31,348 --> 01:02:34,202
<i>No matter how much you
coveted that chairman seat,</i>

663
01:02:34,308 --> 01:02:38,830
<i>you exploit the chairman despite his 
condition, just to make those insinuations?</i>

664
01:02:39,110 --> 01:02:42,652
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

665
01:02:42,933 --> 01:02:48,842
Shouldn't you first assume responsibility 
for the failed apartment...

666
01:03:03,853 --> 01:03:05,944
They...

667
01:03:07,460 --> 01:03:09,597
forged it!

668
01:03:10,619 --> 01:03:12,510
Dad...

669
01:03:25,608 --> 01:03:27,825
You!

670
01:03:29,658 --> 01:03:32,301
Forged!

671
01:03:35,637 --> 01:03:37,763
My testament...

672
01:03:51,169 --> 01:03:52,855
I...

673
01:03:55,347 --> 01:03:56,719
am not...

674
01:03:56,849 --> 01:03:58,693
dead yet.

675
01:04:00,402 --> 01:04:02,945
Hwang Taeseop!

676
01:04:08,493 --> 01:04:10,243
Is fine!

677
01:04:15,074 --> 01:04:17,024
I'm fine...

678
01:04:20,272 --> 01:04:22,516
Dad...
