00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,668
Leave company matters to me.

4
00:00:06,781 --> 00:00:09,307
There's no reason why I should 
report every detail to you.

5
00:00:09,514 --> 00:00:12,560
<i>What?! Minwoo, you little...</i>

6
00:00:12,894 --> 00:00:15,794
You worry about Baekpa.

7
00:00:20,008 --> 00:00:20,816
Chairman.

8
00:00:20,932 --> 00:00:23,937
We just received a call from him.

9
00:00:25,292 --> 00:00:29,616
He says he'll hand Beaute
his resignation and join us tomorrow.

10
00:00:29,796 --> 00:00:31,519
That's out of the question.

11
00:00:31,947 --> 00:00:35,949
Until we get our hands on 
their core technology and schematics,

12
00:00:36,121 --> 00:00:37,721
we won't accept him.

13
00:00:37,834 --> 00:00:40,785
I will tell him that, Chairman.

14
00:00:52,249 --> 00:00:55,792
<i>The new owner of Beaute
Boilers' Korean subsidiary,</i>

15
00:00:55,917 --> 00:01:00,200
with a bid of twelve-point-six-five...

16
00:01:00,849 --> 00:01:03,208
<i>-one (12.651) billion won,</i>

17
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:07,199
is Hangang Construction.

18
00:01:20,718 --> 00:01:22,614
Lee Gangmo...

19
00:01:23,593 --> 00:01:26,101
The game is not over yet.

20
00:01:26,805 --> 00:01:29,049
This Beaute acquisition...

21
00:01:30,832 --> 00:01:33,689
is going to be fatal to you.

22
00:01:52,587 --> 00:01:57,015
Can you handle the boiler company?

23
00:01:58,002 --> 00:02:00,398
We acquired it thanks to you,

24
00:02:00,577 --> 00:02:03,018
and I certainly could trust you with it.

25
00:02:03,327 --> 00:02:05,244
- And...
- But...

26
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,152
I'm enjoying what I'm doing right now.

27
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:12,621
And I set some goals for 
my future as well.

28
00:02:12,762 --> 00:02:15,769
Jeongyeon, seeing you
work in the private lending...

29
00:02:16,626 --> 00:02:18,733
No, no matter how big 
you get in this sector...

30
00:02:18,921 --> 00:02:21,217
I have to go.

31
00:02:21,684 --> 00:02:23,654
Did I upset you?

32
00:02:25,346 --> 00:02:29,246
I know how dangerous 
this line of work is.

33
00:02:30,096 --> 00:02:34,300
But even the construction business
always had its share of risks.

34
00:02:35,028 --> 00:02:37,413
And it's likely that the same 
goes for every other job.

35
00:02:41,312 --> 00:02:43,657
I really better go.

36
00:02:44,467 --> 00:02:46,417
Let me drive you home.

37
00:02:47,498 --> 00:02:49,354
No need.

38
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,818
You looked cool today, Lee Gangmo.

39
00:02:54,734 --> 00:02:58,993
I finally realized how far you've come.

40
00:03:00,602 --> 00:03:02,611
Will you keep watching over me?

41
00:03:02,866 --> 00:03:05,113
While I get back on my feet.

42
00:03:05,455 --> 00:03:06,851
Sure.

43
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,591
<i>- Financial Law -</i>

44
00:04:15,345 --> 00:04:17,455
Eonni is here, Director.

45
00:04:20,474 --> 00:04:22,705
If I knew you were on your way,
I would have come earlier.

46
00:04:22,799 --> 00:04:24,655
Did I make you wait?

47
00:04:25,219 --> 00:04:28,921
No... I just got here.

48
00:04:42,654 --> 00:04:47,600
Looks like Cha Bucheol 
is going to be released soon.

49
00:04:49,162 --> 00:04:51,182
Already?!

50
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,972
And why...

51
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:57,813
This was only a test 
Baekpa put you through.

52
00:04:57,933 --> 00:04:59,046
What?

53
00:04:59,461 --> 00:05:03,369
He'd like to see you tomorrow.

54
00:05:32,878 --> 00:05:35,117
What are all those?

55
00:05:37,525 --> 00:05:40,567
These are your tapes?!

56
00:05:40,697 --> 00:05:41,883
<i>We're in trouble.</i>

57
00:05:41,989 --> 00:05:44,350
I went around stores all day,

58
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:46,910
and almost no one 
was asking for your album.

59
00:05:47,098 --> 00:05:49,755
<i>These were all returned.</i>

60
00:05:50,021 --> 00:05:51,893
Don't tell the director.

61
00:05:52,003 --> 00:05:56,333
She must have lost 
a lot of money because of me.

62
00:05:56,512 --> 00:05:58,976
Let's give it some more time.

63
00:06:08,913 --> 00:06:10,427
<i>Miju.</i>

64
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,002
<i>Cha! Soo! Jeong!</i>

65
00:06:12,111 --> 00:06:14,483
Even the name is fine...

66
00:06:14,592 --> 00:06:18,339
Let's go sell these on the street.

67
00:06:18,457 --> 00:06:18,938
What?!

68
00:06:19,021 --> 00:06:21,117
We need to sell these
if we want people to listen.

69
00:06:21,217 --> 00:06:22,756
It's not like we're
peddlers or something...

70
00:06:22,885 --> 00:06:24,612
How can a singer
embarrass herself that way?

71
00:06:24,682 --> 00:06:26,375
I couldn't care less about that.

72
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,568
People must listen to my songs 
whatever it takes.

73
00:06:29,677 --> 00:06:31,802
That's the only way.

74
00:06:33,155 --> 00:06:34,990
Cha Soojeong! Listen to this!

75
00:06:35,037 --> 00:06:38,789
It's fun and exciting.
Cha Soojeong!

76
00:06:38,883 --> 00:06:42,826
Face, singing, dancing...
She's got it all!

77
00:06:43,046 --> 00:06:44,740
Hi, I'm new singer Cha Soojeong.

78
00:06:44,811 --> 00:06:47,481
Give this a listen. It has
ballads and even dance songs.

79
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,685
The songs are great.
Oppa, oppa! Give this a listen!

80
00:06:49,755 --> 00:06:52,328
Oppa! Try this...
Ehh... Don't just go.

81
00:06:52,398 --> 00:06:55,187
<i>Cha Soojeong, give it a listen.</i>

82
00:06:55,604 --> 00:06:57,102
Soojeong!

83
00:06:57,218 --> 00:06:58,245
What are you doing here?

84
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,068
Did you bring my stage
costumes and the amp?

85
00:07:00,175 --> 00:07:01,149
They're inside the car,

86
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:03,761
are you really going to do it here?

87
00:07:04,019 --> 00:07:05,105
Yes.

88
00:07:36,352 --> 00:07:37,723
<i>Hello everyone!</i>

89
00:07:37,853 --> 00:07:42,023
Here is new singer Cha Soojeong!

90
00:07:44,777 --> 00:07:49,851
Eonni, come closer.
Everyone, please come closer.

91
00:07:56,604 --> 00:07:59,955
She's new singer Cha Soojeong.
Her album is great!

92
00:08:00,048 --> 00:08:03,624
- That's not too bad?!
- She'll be on TV soon.

93
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:12,152
Folks... How are you?
She's new singer Cha Soojeong.

94
00:08:12,234 --> 00:08:14,149
<i>One tape for 2,000 won. Pick one.</i>

95
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:18,211
Here you go. Her songs are great.

96
00:08:43,006 --> 00:08:44,380
Thank you.

97
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:46,294
See you again.

98
00:08:50,915 --> 00:08:55,188
Professor Park Seonghwa of Hanguk
University seemed particularly interested.

99
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:56,692
I bet he is.

100
00:08:56,821 --> 00:09:00,239
Developing gas boilers
that suit Korea's ondol culture?!

101
00:09:00,505 --> 00:09:02,523
It's a very stimulating project.

102
00:09:02,611 --> 00:09:06,434
But considering the
development costs involved...

103
00:09:06,543 --> 00:09:08,539
Spare no expense.

104
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,390
Ahh, also.

105
00:09:10,723 --> 00:09:13,667
How about Beaute's core
technology and schematics?

106
00:09:13,808 --> 00:09:15,702
We're in the process of acquiring them.

107
00:09:20,283 --> 00:09:22,703
Why is it so noisy outside?

108
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:56,744
What's wrong?
Is anything the matter?

109
00:09:57,249 --> 00:09:59,011
Just a moment...

110
00:10:42,887 --> 00:10:46,525
<i>In the midst of a movement for direct
elections aiming for ten million signatures,</i>

111
00:10:46,636 --> 00:10:52,375
<i>163 professors from 23 different universities 
joined the demonstrations and signed.</i>

112
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:58,846
<i>Along with them an SNU professor
who was praying at Myeongdong Cathedral...</i>

113
00:10:58,963 --> 00:11:04,408
<i>along with 62 priests
joined the protests, pushing for...</i>

114
00:11:04,582 --> 00:11:05,959
Turn it off.

115
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:14,189
We should just teach all those fools 
asking for direct elections a lesson.

116
00:11:16,273 --> 00:11:18,939
Anything planned on your side?

117
00:11:19,258 --> 00:11:21,535
The entire ANSP is
in turmoil because of this.

118
00:11:21,629 --> 00:11:25,467
But how is the ruling party reacting?

119
00:11:25,581 --> 00:11:26,798
Why are you asking?

120
00:11:26,901 --> 00:11:29,656
To allow direct elections,
the constitution needs to be amended,

121
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:33,520
and without the ruling party's
approval, that's impossible.

122
00:11:33,611 --> 00:11:34,659
Sure is.

123
00:11:34,748 --> 00:11:38,570
But who would ever dare
to rile the president with this?

124
00:11:38,887 --> 00:11:41,329
All this chaos is useless.

125
00:11:43,232 --> 00:11:46,259
So you said they
released that Bucheol fella?

126
00:11:46,462 --> 00:11:47,101
Yes.

127
00:11:47,194 --> 00:11:50,656
Find that fool and bring him here.

128
00:11:50,831 --> 00:11:52,676
All right, Congressman.

129
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,416
It's not my fault, Sir!

130
00:12:03,705 --> 00:12:09,348
This could only happen if
someone from within got involved.

131
00:12:10,236 --> 00:12:13,212
And you're suggesting 
that would be me?

132
00:12:13,342 --> 00:12:15,569
Let's be honest!

133
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:18,862
Unless you let Hwang Jeongyeon 
in on all this, she...

134
00:12:18,945 --> 00:12:20,544
<i>You idiot!</i>

135
00:12:20,765 --> 00:12:25,313
What is even more pathetic than
a loser is someone making excuses!

136
00:12:28,355 --> 00:12:33,112
I want all the money I invested
in you back by the end of the day,

137
00:12:33,217 --> 00:12:34,733
so better get ready.

138
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:36,765
Sir...

139
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:38,809
Please, don't abandon me!

140
00:12:38,914 --> 00:12:40,782
You may leave.

141
00:12:41,181 --> 00:12:42,638
Sir!

142
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:45,621
Are you planning to disobey me?

143
00:13:02,713 --> 00:13:03,805
<i>Sir.</i>

144
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:05,908
<i>It's me.</i>

145
00:13:06,721 --> 00:13:08,644
<i>Come on in.</i>

146
00:13:33,558 --> 00:13:38,222
How did you find out about Bucheol?

147
00:13:38,391 --> 00:13:41,356
President Lee Gangmo helped me.

148
00:13:41,931 --> 00:13:43,552
Is that so?

149
00:13:44,903 --> 00:13:46,594
But, Sir.

150
00:13:47,053 --> 00:13:50,541
There is something
I still don't understand.

151
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:57,344
Congressman Jo Pilyeon
was helping Cha Bucheol.

152
00:13:58,261 --> 00:14:03,030
Jo Pilyeon was helping Bucheol?!

153
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:12,906
Yoo Gyeongok, Hwang Jeongyeon...

154
00:14:13,188 --> 00:14:15,267
You just wait.

155
00:14:15,597 --> 00:14:19,247
I will personally make sure you two...

156
00:14:30,347 --> 00:14:33,377
The congressman wishes to see you.

157
00:14:34,822 --> 00:14:41,012
You didn't think you could get away 
with getting him in trouble, did you?

158
00:14:49,985 --> 00:14:52,863
I have no reason 
to meet Congressman Jo?!

159
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,462
Seems like I didn't make myself clear.

160
00:15:06,515 --> 00:15:07,674
Stop there!

161
00:15:07,764 --> 00:15:09,403
Stop!

162
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:24,533
Stop!

163
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,723
Let's not waste time.

164
00:15:54,809 --> 00:15:57,298
Get in the car 
before I have to carry you in.

165
00:16:04,828 --> 00:16:07,030
<i>You prick!</i>

166
00:16:15,522 --> 00:16:16,982
Come.

167
00:16:22,478 --> 00:16:25,356
You were the one who approached me.

168
00:16:25,556 --> 00:16:29,326
And I did right as you asked.

169
00:16:29,902 --> 00:16:34,207
But the results are a complete disaster.

170
00:16:35,663 --> 00:16:38,329
Lee Gangmo ended up
acquiring that boiler company,

171
00:16:38,611 --> 00:16:41,489
and you've embarrassed me 
in everyone's eyes.

172
00:16:41,654 --> 00:16:43,734
I apologize, Congressman.

173
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,123
You apologize?!

174
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:52,704
And now you're even
saying the word I most despise.

175
00:16:54,987 --> 00:16:57,701
Get down, you little...

176
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:08,492
You...

177
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:12,591
<i>You said you were a gangster?</i>

178
00:17:12,767 --> 00:17:16,549
No... An enforcer,
now that I think about it.

179
00:17:17,205 --> 00:17:21,006
You know, it finally hit me.

180
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:25,622
The fact that I should
take care of things by myself.

181
00:17:27,972 --> 00:17:31,319
And you'll have to 
be the first on that list.

182
00:17:31,448 --> 00:17:32,811
Arms down.

183
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:34,965
Stay put, you prick!

184
00:17:37,001 --> 00:17:39,123
Please, don't!

185
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:42,886
I'll do everything you ask!

186
00:17:44,609 --> 00:17:46,238
Everything.

187
00:17:46,335 --> 00:17:48,548
Please, spare me...

188
00:18:15,182 --> 00:18:17,567
Baekpa is here.

189
00:18:41,929 --> 00:18:46,718
<i>Baekpa's organization
is structured like a pyramid.</i>

190
00:18:47,452 --> 00:18:49,848
<i>With the exception 
of a few veteran members,</i>

191
00:18:50,136 --> 00:18:54,914
<i>people in the lower tiers of the
organization have never even seen him.</i>

192
00:18:55,038 --> 00:18:59,746
<i>So you're telling me that they
are all doing business with his money?</i>

193
00:19:00,174 --> 00:19:03,052
They pay interests every month.

194
00:19:03,258 --> 00:19:04,978
Principal and interests included,

195
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:09,023
nobody knows the full extent 
of Baekpa's assets.

196
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,895
Let's see what 
this pyramid looks like, then.

197
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:21,357
I want every detail, from ranks all
the way to the members' controlled area.

198
00:19:21,868 --> 00:19:23,266
You'll have to forgive me,

199
00:19:23,383 --> 00:19:25,225
but I don't possess such information.

200
00:19:25,344 --> 00:19:26,790
You don't?

201
00:19:27,342 --> 00:19:28,223
No.

202
00:19:28,352 --> 00:19:30,232
It's such a meticulously
organized operation,

203
00:19:30,372 --> 00:19:32,063
with the exception
of a few veteran members,

204
00:19:32,169 --> 00:19:34,907
few people are fully aware 
of its structure.

205
00:19:35,399 --> 00:19:37,441
How long would you need to find out?

206
00:19:37,535 --> 00:19:41,860
Are you planning to
go all out against Baekpa?

207
00:19:42,216 --> 00:19:45,994
That old fart and I
have a lot left to settle.

208
00:19:51,345 --> 00:19:54,684
Baekpa will soon die.

209
00:19:56,267 --> 00:19:58,751
All the more reason
why we need to hurry.

210
00:20:00,315 --> 00:20:05,832
Because we must stop Hwang Jeongyeon
and her mother from inheriting that fortune.

211
00:20:09,773 --> 00:20:11,650
You have a week to find out.

212
00:20:11,746 --> 00:20:18,780
Or else you won't make it 
to Baekpa's funeral alive.

213
00:20:20,903 --> 00:20:22,648
All right.

214
00:20:26,003 --> 00:20:29,538
And as for the Eulji-Ro area, 
which Bucheol was taking care of,

215
00:20:30,066 --> 00:20:32,439
this lady will take over.

216
00:20:33,213 --> 00:20:38,138
So you're letting this kiddo
join the family just like that?

217
00:20:38,232 --> 00:20:41,072
I'm making an announcement.

218
00:20:41,186 --> 00:20:44,677
I didn't come here
to ask for your consent.

219
00:20:46,553 --> 00:20:48,750
I apologize, Sir.

220
00:20:48,967 --> 00:20:53,123
Remember these four people well.

221
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:57,798
They're going to lead you from now on.

222
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:06,226
I'll be counting on you.

223
00:21:06,673 --> 00:21:08,703
My name is Hwang Jeongyeon.

224
00:21:18,733 --> 00:21:24,035
For the time being, 
help her out in the Eulji-Ro area.

225
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,441
All right, Sir.

226
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:47,060
Hire a few bodyguards 
to protect Jeongyeon.

227
00:21:47,573 --> 00:21:49,312
Bodyguards?

228
00:21:49,556 --> 00:21:51,790
That's really not necessary, Sir.

229
00:21:51,908 --> 00:21:54,210
Now that you've officially
been entrusted an area,

230
00:21:54,316 --> 00:21:57,587
it would be wiser to follow his wishes.

231
00:21:58,028 --> 00:22:00,494
Yes, all right.

232
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,390
I'm tired.

233
00:22:05,128 --> 00:22:08,147
You don't look too good these days.

234
00:22:44,026 --> 00:22:49,605
We'll install the boilers we're
producing in the new Suseo apartments.

235
00:22:49,949 --> 00:22:53,037
Spare no efforts to boost our production.

236
00:22:53,145 --> 00:22:54,548
Don't worry about it, President.

237
00:22:54,641 --> 00:22:58,614
Anyhow, since we're 
all on the same boat now,

238
00:22:59,014 --> 00:23:01,277
how about you make a toast, President?

239
00:23:01,363 --> 00:23:02,682
Shall I?

240
00:23:03,046 --> 00:23:04,879
Here.

241
00:23:05,239 --> 00:23:10,540
Have you even thought about why
Beaute would sell its subsidiary?

242
00:23:12,537 --> 00:23:14,381
Watch your mouth.

243
00:23:14,483 --> 00:23:18,929
President, you've been fooled.

244
00:23:20,906 --> 00:23:22,797
Stop it, Director Yang!

245
00:23:22,908 --> 00:23:27,166
Why, is there any problem 
with this factory?

246
00:23:46,081 --> 00:23:47,936
Good job.

247
00:23:48,554 --> 00:23:51,757
Don't worry about 
your kid's hospital bills.

248
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:56,528
You have our support
until his full recovery.

249
00:24:08,417 --> 00:24:11,892
It's part of the schematics
for Beaute's boilers.

250
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:20,923
When can you get your hands
on their core technology?

251
00:24:21,087 --> 00:24:26,040
Since it's restricted information,
it might not be so easy to acquire it.

252
00:24:27,571 --> 00:24:31,119
Let the press in on all the boiler-related
accidents that we've been putting under the rug.

253
00:24:31,259 --> 00:24:35,104
You want to disclose
Beaute's accident logs?

254
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:38,820
Now that Hangang Construction acquired it,
no need to keep hiding them.

255
00:24:38,985 --> 00:24:40,190
All right, Chairman.

256
00:24:40,285 --> 00:24:44,224
This Suseo sales war
will be fought with boilers.

257
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:47,947
We must acquire Beaute's core
technology as soon as possible.

258
00:24:48,041 --> 00:24:49,761
Yes, Chairman.

259
00:24:55,449 --> 00:24:59,003
<i>There were this
many boiler-related accidents?</i>

260
00:24:59,347 --> 00:25:01,321
Seven cases of gas poisoning,

261
00:25:01,415 --> 00:25:04,739
and nine caused by oxygen deficiency.

262
00:25:04,933 --> 00:25:09,543
Seems like these ventilation issues
won't be solved so easily?!

263
00:25:11,891 --> 00:25:13,345
Reporter Yoon is here.

264
00:25:13,427 --> 00:25:16,387
Aigoo... How is everyone doing?

265
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,725
- Come on in.
- Gangmo.

266
00:25:19,324 --> 00:25:25,949
Info leaks about boiler-related accidents
are pouring down every news agency.

267
00:25:27,249 --> 00:25:28,435
Once those articles are published,

268
00:25:28,506 --> 00:25:32,376
Beaute's reliability in the eyes
of the customers will suffer greatly.

269
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:34,790
Get in touch with the factory, and let's 
find out the cause of those accidents.

270
00:25:34,884 --> 00:25:38,210
Ohh... I already had set up 
a meeting for this evening.

271
00:25:38,315 --> 00:25:40,771
Sotae, check how those
news agencies are proceeding.

272
00:25:40,877 --> 00:25:42,240
Okay.

273
00:25:49,111 --> 00:25:50,650
If you want me to,

274
00:25:51,202 --> 00:25:53,668
I could write a rebuttal.

275
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,932
Thank you, Seonsaengnim.

276
00:25:56,599 --> 00:26:01,308
Right... You didn't know that
Chairman Hwang came back, did you?

277
00:26:01,954 --> 00:26:05,078
I went to meet my parents,
and my mother said so.

278
00:26:05,366 --> 00:26:07,768
She said he's pretty much fully recovered.

279
00:26:11,762 --> 00:26:13,750
<i>Come on in.</i>

280
00:26:13,948 --> 00:26:16,755
Director. We have guests.

281
00:26:19,049 --> 00:26:20,875
Dad...

282
00:26:21,507 --> 00:26:23,398
Jeongyeon.

283
00:26:23,604 --> 00:26:25,395
How have you been?

284
00:26:27,991 --> 00:26:31,669
So you've fully recovered?

285
00:26:32,313 --> 00:26:33,571
That's right.

286
00:26:33,664 --> 00:26:35,013
Come to me.

287
00:26:35,166 --> 00:26:38,655
Let Daddy hug his little girl.

288
00:26:40,922 --> 00:26:42,695
Dad...

289
00:26:44,224 --> 00:26:48,299
You've worked hard.

290
00:26:52,187 --> 00:26:54,092
Dad.

291
00:27:03,936 --> 00:27:07,276
<i>- Urban Development Research Center -
President Hwang Taeseop</i>

292
00:27:10,506 --> 00:27:12,954
I've heard about you.

293
00:27:13,249 --> 00:27:18,440
So you're handling the Eulji-Ro area now?

294
00:27:18,722 --> 00:27:20,754
How did you find out?

295
00:27:24,043 --> 00:27:26,952
I've heard it from Director Yoo.

296
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:32,426
I told her not to tell you 
I was back on purpose.

297
00:27:32,879 --> 00:27:36,790
I wanted to settle
a few things first, and...

298
00:27:36,898 --> 00:27:40,487
What's going on between
you and Director Yoo?

299
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:42,085
Uh?!

300
00:27:43,107 --> 00:27:44,634
Why?

301
00:27:44,858 --> 00:27:50,214
Actually, I knew you two were close 
ever since you collapsed.

302
00:27:50,308 --> 00:27:52,256
Listen to you...

303
00:27:52,409 --> 00:27:54,030
I told you that it's not the case.

304
00:27:54,124 --> 00:27:56,184
I can perfectly understand.

305
00:27:56,290 --> 00:28:00,467
Friend or whatever, it's always nice 
to have someone you can rely on.

306
00:28:01,968 --> 00:28:05,530
So you're not getting married?

307
00:28:07,397 --> 00:28:09,852
You're not getting any younger,

308
00:28:10,592 --> 00:28:12,072
how much longer will you keep staying...

309
00:28:12,143 --> 00:28:14,448
I'm very busy these days.

310
00:28:14,542 --> 00:28:16,689
Even if I had a man,
I'd probably get dumped?!

311
00:28:16,794 --> 00:28:23,281
There would be no one
better than Gangmo for you...

312
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:25,483
Dad.

313
00:28:25,588 --> 00:28:31,907
If I think that you'll never be able 
to get any closer because of me,

314
00:28:32,917 --> 00:28:39,413
it just breaks my heart so much 
I can't even sleep.

315
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:45,196
Promise you'll never say that again.

316
00:28:46,112 --> 00:28:50,716
It's over between Gangmo and me.

317
00:28:51,198 --> 00:28:53,853
There are no feelings left whatsoever.

318
00:28:54,401 --> 00:28:56,484
Jeongyeon.

319
00:28:57,208 --> 00:28:59,450
I'm full of plans for the future.

320
00:28:59,611 --> 00:29:02,610
First, I'll make a lot of money.

321
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:08,624
After which I'll get my hands on Manbo 
Construction, and give it back to you.

322
00:29:09,283 --> 00:29:13,776
And you have no intention 
of getting married?

323
00:29:14,166 --> 00:29:17,629
Why wouldn't I get married, 
unless I was crazy?

324
00:29:17,925 --> 00:29:19,133
If dating doesn't cut it,

325
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:23,542
I'll just make a ton of money
and meet the coolest man on earth.

326
00:29:23,801 --> 00:29:26,432
So I can take my time, right?

327
00:29:30,061 --> 00:29:37,004
I'm glad to see that
you've become so strong.

328
00:29:44,811 --> 00:29:46,444
What are you saying?

329
00:29:46,925 --> 00:29:48,546
Baekpa has cancer?!

330
00:29:48,676 --> 00:29:51,427
Looks like the hospital gave up, too.

331
00:29:51,699 --> 00:29:53,905
It's legit info.

332
00:29:54,634 --> 00:29:56,701
But the real issue is Jo Pilyeon.

333
00:29:57,722 --> 00:30:02,609
A huge storm is about to hit 
his private lending empire.

334
00:30:03,449 --> 00:30:06,127
He has set his sights on Baekpa's fortune.

335
00:30:06,268 --> 00:30:08,018
And is that even possible?

336
00:30:08,699 --> 00:30:11,577
It's always a matter 
of finding a just cause.

337
00:30:12,204 --> 00:30:14,737
If he plays the secret
fund or tax evasion card,

338
00:30:14,878 --> 00:30:16,447
it's not completely unfeasible.

339
00:30:16,529 --> 00:30:18,081
You must stop it, Hyung!

340
00:30:18,209 --> 00:30:22,014
We can't allow Jo Pilyeon 
to get his hands on that money.

341
00:30:31,844 --> 00:30:33,289
Yes.

342
00:30:43,118 --> 00:30:45,525
I see you're enjoying yourself.

343
00:30:47,276 --> 00:30:50,283
You're the one who
barged in without a call,

344
00:30:50,447 --> 00:30:52,644
so you'll have to wait a moment.

345
00:30:58,424 --> 00:31:03,459
And should this single move 
ruin the entire game?

346
00:31:03,553 --> 00:31:08,240
I never make such reckless moves.

347
00:31:11,858 --> 00:31:15,159
Then, I'll let you choose.

348
00:31:15,453 --> 00:31:18,847
Either accept the offer
I made you in the past,

349
00:31:18,971 --> 00:31:24,771
or make the worst possible move 
you could think of.

350
00:31:25,781 --> 00:31:29,658
Still looking for bribe money, I see...

351
00:31:31,532 --> 00:31:35,583
I'm well aware 
that your days are numbered.

352
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:45,133
So what your last move
ends up being is crucial.

353
00:31:46,137 --> 00:31:50,450
It can either help you protect
everything you've achieved over the years,

354
00:31:50,603 --> 00:31:52,283
or else...

355
00:31:57,345 --> 00:32:02,064
consign you to a miserable demise,
deprived of all your money and fame.

356
00:32:10,901 --> 00:32:13,661
Seems you don't know that those
 who have already lost everything...

357
00:32:14,084 --> 00:32:18,229
can be much scarier than people 
who have everything to lose.

358
00:32:20,482 --> 00:32:21,506
What?

359
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:26,601
As you said, my days are numbered.

360
00:32:27,072 --> 00:32:30,366
I'm fighting with my back to the wall.

361
00:32:30,595 --> 00:32:35,253
Since I can look death in
the eyes without fearing it.

362
00:32:36,744 --> 00:32:38,812
Did I make myself clear?

363
00:32:39,147 --> 00:32:46,046
You will never take away
a single penny from me!

364
00:32:47,724 --> 00:32:50,392
Need I remind you
of certain old practices...

365
00:32:51,426 --> 00:32:53,235
You know,

366
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:56,790
beheading criminals 
after digging up their corpse.

367
00:32:56,884 --> 00:32:58,529
Your death will not be the end of it.

368
00:32:58,646 --> 00:33:04,425
Since all I need is your fortune,
and to get my hands on it.

369
00:33:06,293 --> 00:33:09,066
So watch out, 
even if it's from six feet under.

370
00:33:09,148 --> 00:33:16,854
See what's the price to pay
for daring to play with fire.

371
00:34:25,147 --> 00:34:26,536
Sir!

372
00:34:27,592 --> 00:34:29,016
Sir!

373
00:34:29,094 --> 00:34:29,906
Wake up!

374
00:34:30,035 --> 00:34:30,916
Sir!

375
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:31,832
Sir!

376
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:33,385
Sir!!

377
00:34:33,481 --> 00:34:35,027
Sir!

378
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:57,458
You must go through surgery right now.

379
00:34:57,623 --> 00:35:00,783
When it comes to scars on my body,

380
00:35:02,321 --> 00:35:05,289
this is more than enough.

381
00:35:05,747 --> 00:35:11,105
Even if the Pearly Gates await me,
I want to go free of any more scars.

382
00:35:11,217 --> 00:35:12,922
Sir...

383
00:35:17,975 --> 00:35:19,169
I've had it with this.

384
00:35:19,286 --> 00:35:21,123
I'll have to go home.

385
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:22,763
Sir.

386
00:35:23,625 --> 00:35:28,014
Jo Pilyeon is trying to get
his hands on your fortune.

387
00:35:29,506 --> 00:35:31,901
You must survive, Sir.

388
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:36,585
You can never let Jo Pilyeon 
take all that money away from you.

389
00:35:36,696 --> 00:35:43,462
You know what keeps me going these days?

390
00:35:43,588 --> 00:35:48,646
It is neither my painkillers
nor any other medicine.

391
00:35:50,689 --> 00:35:52,722
Jo Pilyeon...

392
00:35:52,956 --> 00:36:01,501
That Jo Pilyeon is pushing me to fight
back even more than those cancer cells!

393
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:09,136
I have no intention 
of letting him defeat me.

394
00:36:10,804 --> 00:36:13,237
And even if this brings my demise,

395
00:36:13,484 --> 00:36:19,909
the dagger of revenge
will not pierce my heart,

396
00:36:20,767 --> 00:36:23,269
but that of Jo Pilyeon.

397
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:26,488
You just wait.

398
00:36:42,444 --> 00:36:44,477
Thank you, Deputy.

399
00:36:46,027 --> 00:36:48,083
I've heard from Director Kim.

400
00:36:48,225 --> 00:36:52,096
That Soojeong's song getting 
radio airtime was all thanks to you.

401
00:36:52,201 --> 00:36:55,067
That?

402
00:36:56,101 --> 00:37:01,164
I just didn't want to see 
such talent be buried that way,

403
00:37:01,305 --> 00:37:02,761
so it's nothing.

404
00:37:02,843 --> 00:37:06,759
Still, I'll tell Soojeong 
to come pay her respects.

405
00:37:06,856 --> 00:37:09,412
Ahh... That... That won't be necessary.

406
00:37:09,671 --> 00:37:14,780
Why, did you tell her I was helping you?

407
00:37:15,097 --> 00:37:17,130
No. Not yet...

408
00:37:17,658 --> 00:37:18,885
Don't tell her, then.

409
00:37:18,991 --> 00:37:22,550
I can't stand burdensome
situations like that.

410
00:37:22,867 --> 00:37:27,343
So you told Director Kim
she was your niece?

411
00:37:27,843 --> 00:37:33,931
Then... Why don't you make
her your niece for real?

412
00:37:36,033 --> 00:37:38,230
I'm a busy man.

413
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:42,329
Let's just end it at that.

414
00:37:45,233 --> 00:37:46,925
If you prefer it that way,

415
00:37:47,125 --> 00:37:49,227
fine with me.

416
00:38:13,622 --> 00:38:15,314
Director...

417
00:38:21,856 --> 00:38:24,395
Why did you miss this
evening's vocal training?

418
00:38:25,687 --> 00:38:26,873
I apologize.

419
00:38:26,982 --> 00:38:31,646
What are you, already acting like a singer 
just because you were on the radio?

420
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,591
But... Di...Director...
It's not that...

421
00:38:34,697 --> 00:38:37,575
Can't you even keep her under control?

422
00:38:37,684 --> 00:38:40,071
It's not his fault.

423
00:38:40,167 --> 00:38:42,412
I'm the only one to blame, Director.

424
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:47,218
Actually, Soojeong has been selling 
her albums in Myeong-Dong all day.

425
00:38:47,583 --> 00:38:48,734
What?!

426
00:38:48,957 --> 00:38:50,419
Selling her albums?!

427
00:38:50,513 --> 00:38:54,566
She's been working so hard, 
fearing you'd incur losses because of her...

428
00:38:54,683 --> 00:38:58,184
I couldn't bear to stop her...

429
00:38:58,407 --> 00:39:00,785
I apologize, Director.

430
00:39:00,913 --> 00:39:02,671
I'm sorry.

431
00:39:13,479 --> 00:39:18,084
Real stars never beg
the masses for acceptance.

432
00:39:18,181 --> 00:39:20,298
They make the masses go crazy for them.

433
00:39:21,473 --> 00:39:25,255
Weak sales right off the bat
is nothing you should worry about.

434
00:39:25,385 --> 00:39:29,944
If you have time to waste that way,
invest it on improving your image.

435
00:39:30,089 --> 00:39:33,296
That's what you must do 
for my sake, is that clear?

436
00:39:33,601 --> 00:39:36,027
I apologize, Director.

437
00:39:36,397 --> 00:39:42,176
But I wanted to overcome this challenge 
without having to rely on you.

438
00:39:42,281 --> 00:39:46,524
What are you saying, that you'll
keep selling albums on the street?

439
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:50,721
It won't negatively impact
my image like you fear.

440
00:39:50,832 --> 00:39:52,921
And I'll follow my training
schedule thoroughly.

441
00:39:53,035 --> 00:39:54,534
Please, give me permission.

442
00:39:54,686 --> 00:39:59,519
But if the results aren't satisfactory,
I might completely give up on you.

443
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:01,688
Will you still keep obsessing over it?

444
00:40:02,369 --> 00:40:05,399
Yes. I want to do it.

445
00:40:07,408 --> 00:40:08,975
Fine, then.

446
00:40:09,492 --> 00:40:12,264
I'll let you do 
as you please for a month.

447
00:40:13,098 --> 00:40:15,083
Thank you, Director.

448
00:40:15,271 --> 00:40:17,091
No need to thank me.

449
00:40:17,389 --> 00:40:20,733
Because if you fail,
you and I are history.

450
00:40:34,746 --> 00:40:37,556
<i>Our next song is one of the
most popular hits these days.</i>

451
00:40:37,661 --> 00:40:39,705
<i>Here is new singer Cha Soojeong,</i>

452
00:40:39,823 --> 00:40:41,855
<i>with "Under the Spotlight."</i>

453
00:40:51,012 --> 00:40:52,692
Nice, isn't it?

454
00:40:52,921 --> 00:40:54,313
Wait.

455
00:41:05,999 --> 00:41:06,622
<i>Our Miju is great!</i>

456
00:41:06,657 --> 00:41:10,851
"And he will remain hidden
at the bottom of my heart."

457
00:41:16,158 --> 00:41:16,828
Oppa...

458
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:19,240
You're messing up all the beats.

459
00:41:20,093 --> 00:41:23,359
Why...
Didn't I, like, get it right?

460
00:41:23,995 --> 00:41:26,871
Do it right, will you?

461
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:34,827
Seonbaenim, what's the matter?

462
00:41:44,074 --> 00:41:47,410
She sounds just like my sister...

463
00:41:49,724 --> 00:41:53,753
Miju always dreamed
of becoming a singer, too.

464
00:41:53,956 --> 00:41:57,194
Singers often use stage names,

465
00:41:57,464 --> 00:41:59,308
should I look into it?

466
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:08,396
It's the organizational
chart of Baekpa's group.

467
00:42:22,404 --> 00:42:25,352
I still couldn't fully
figure out all the details.

468
00:42:25,841 --> 00:42:30,063
This should be more than enough
to make its foundation shake.

469
00:42:30,262 --> 00:42:32,083
I know I'm in no position 
to tell you this,

470
00:42:32,201 --> 00:42:34,255
but should those 
foundations start shaking,

471
00:42:34,325 --> 00:42:37,132
political circles will bear 
the brunt as well.

472
00:42:38,436 --> 00:42:43,229
As you well know, this "underground economy"
is used by politicians for their money-laund...

473
00:42:43,428 --> 00:42:45,249
Biting more than you
can chew, aren't we...

474
00:42:45,367 --> 00:42:46,600
I apologize, Congressman.

475
00:42:46,694 --> 00:42:49,820
Call the Blue House Security Service,
and get the car ready.

476
00:42:49,914 --> 00:42:51,640
<i>All right.</i>

477
00:43:02,626 --> 00:43:04,188
Yes, Sir.

478
00:43:14,557 --> 00:43:16,896
How many times do I have to tell you?

479
00:43:17,019 --> 00:43:19,773
I'll take full responsibility,
so proceed as instructed!

480
00:43:19,855 --> 00:43:21,840
Is that clear?

481
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:25,008
Useless fools...

482
00:43:25,101 --> 00:43:29,410
They owe their livelihood to the state,
and still fear a bunch of loan sharks?

483
00:43:40,798 --> 00:43:42,354
Who are you?

484
00:43:43,734 --> 00:43:46,084
We are conducting a tax investigation.

485
00:43:46,894 --> 00:43:48,738
Why did the revenue office send you?

486
00:43:48,922 --> 00:43:51,029
- Search the entire place.
- Yes.

487
00:44:32,019 --> 00:44:35,788
Eight places in Myeong-Dong
alone were investigated.

488
00:44:36,329 --> 00:44:38,525
And all belonging to
our affiliated members.

489
00:44:39,066 --> 00:44:41,849
It's clear that they're targeting us.

490
00:44:44,628 --> 00:44:49,174
All the complaints within the group 
are being directed at Baekpa.

491
00:44:50,713 --> 00:44:53,403
We must find a solution right away,

492
00:44:53,896 --> 00:44:57,899
but with him in
such condition as of late...

493
00:44:58,003 --> 00:45:00,219
<i>And he's not going to get better.</i>

494
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:02,792
What are you trying to say?

495
00:45:04,342 --> 00:45:08,829
Because even the hospital
has given up on trying to treat him.

496
00:45:30,342 --> 00:45:32,116
<i>Sir...</i>

497
00:45:37,038 --> 00:45:39,049
Come on in.

498
00:45:45,477 --> 00:45:49,459
You came home early tonight.

499
00:45:56,166 --> 00:45:58,316
Let me do it for you.

500
00:45:58,809 --> 00:46:00,407
<i>All right.</i>

501
00:46:34,174 --> 00:46:35,759
Do you...

502
00:46:37,146 --> 00:46:40,141
remember the very first time...

503
00:46:40,622 --> 00:46:42,466
we met?

504
00:46:42,825 --> 00:46:47,751
Back then, you were in
really terrible condition.

505
00:46:48,491 --> 00:46:54,329
You were so drunk
that I had to help you to sleep,

506
00:46:54,669 --> 00:46:58,000
but then I heard
you cry the entire night.

507
00:47:00,878 --> 00:47:03,109
From the very start,

508
00:47:04,413 --> 00:47:09,883
what I was going for was your money belt.

509
00:47:10,834 --> 00:47:16,707
I sneaked in the morning after
and took it on my way out,

510
00:47:18,199 --> 00:47:20,760
but it was filled with so
much money that it startled me.

511
00:47:22,174 --> 00:47:28,117
I purposely added even more money 
while you were sleeping.

512
00:47:28,548 --> 00:47:33,920
Since wherever you went, you at
least needed a roof over your head.

513
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:44,421
I really thought it was all you had.

514
00:47:44,527 --> 00:47:49,747
If you hadn't come back that day,

515
00:47:50,076 --> 00:47:55,292
you would have gained yourself a house, 
but then we wouldn't have met.

516
00:48:01,176 --> 00:48:02,935
Why were you...

517
00:48:04,007 --> 00:48:08,878
so kind to me?

518
00:48:11,153 --> 00:48:17,509
That's just what people call destiny.

519
00:48:18,432 --> 00:48:21,080
The answer to that question...

520
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:27,681
is something even Buddha
himself wouldn't know.

521
00:48:35,104 --> 00:48:37,428
I'm sorry, Sir...

522
00:48:37,769 --> 00:48:41,148
I have no right to serve you.

523
00:48:46,951 --> 00:48:53,376
I swore that I would bring you
peace of mind to the very end...

524
00:48:57,073 --> 00:49:00,044
Please forgive me, Sir.

525
00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:08,438
But look.

526
00:49:09,647 --> 00:49:18,011
Look at whose hands are
comforting me in my final moments.

527
00:49:21,842 --> 00:49:24,767
These warm hands of yours...

528
00:49:25,037 --> 00:49:32,250
are more precious to me 
than all the money in the world.

529
00:49:35,624 --> 00:49:38,243
Sir...

530
00:49:43,388 --> 00:49:45,913
Don't cry, darling.

531
00:49:46,336 --> 00:49:48,979
You've done enough.

532
00:49:49,249 --> 00:49:52,198
I'm thankful, on the contrary.

533
00:49:53,055 --> 00:49:56,297
My only true regret...

534
00:49:56,884 --> 00:50:00,302
was finding out that there is
something more precious than money...

535
00:50:00,561 --> 00:50:02,990
when it was much too late.

536
00:50:03,997 --> 00:50:07,947
If only I had realized 
that a little earlier,

537
00:50:08,613 --> 00:50:11,271
I would have been much happier.

538
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:32,448
<i>Check!</i>

539
00:50:32,782 --> 00:50:35,443
Director Ju, check...
Checkmate, I'm afraid!

540
00:50:35,619 --> 00:50:38,209
Why did it get so tangled in here?!

541
00:50:39,331 --> 00:50:41,766
I guess you'll have to give
him another thousand won.

542
00:50:41,874 --> 00:50:47,254
These days you're helping out 
a great deal with groceries.

543
00:50:47,383 --> 00:50:49,697
Ahh... This...

544
00:50:50,284 --> 00:50:51,612
Aigoo... Youngguk.

545
00:50:51,694 --> 00:50:53,979
What are those eyes of yours for?

546
00:50:54,077 --> 00:50:56,890
See over there?
Your cannon is still free.

547
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:59,039
Ohh... The cannon.

548
00:50:59,771 --> 00:51:01,283
<i>There you go.</i>

549
00:51:01,530 --> 00:51:04,842
- Aigoo... Chairman.
- Aigoo... Chairman!

550
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,233
Yes.

551
00:51:11,409 --> 00:51:14,276
- Urban Development...
- Chairman Hwang Taeseop?

552
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:17,004
Who am I speaking to?

553
00:51:17,114 --> 00:51:18,974
<i>I'm Lee Seongmo.</i>

554
00:51:21,126 --> 00:51:24,685
And how did you 
find out about this place?

555
00:51:30,523 --> 00:51:35,714
There is something I've been
preparing for a very long time.

556
00:51:36,642 --> 00:51:42,186
It might become the weapon that
shocks the current regime into submission.

557
00:51:43,125 --> 00:51:47,394
So, this thing you've been preparing...

558
00:51:52,516 --> 00:51:54,161
Open it.

559
00:52:20,867 --> 00:52:23,644
This account...

560
00:52:23,733 --> 00:52:25,588
That account...

561
00:52:26,697 --> 00:52:31,942
will become the perfect opportunity 
to turn Jo Pilyeon's world upside down.

562
00:52:33,173 --> 00:52:34,668
But...

563
00:52:35,781 --> 00:52:37,886
Don't you value your life?

564
00:52:38,399 --> 00:52:41,209
The moment this is exposed...

565
00:52:41,272 --> 00:52:48,155
Didn't you put your life
on the line to kill Jo Pilyeon, too?

566
00:52:51,946 --> 00:52:53,830
Tell me...

567
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:58,212
What do you want me to do?

568
00:53:10,591 --> 00:53:13,034
I think we need to have a word.

569
00:53:14,538 --> 00:53:18,495
I'm in a hurry, 
so it'll have to be quick.

570
00:53:25,845 --> 00:53:31,139
So the private lending... Sure,
let's call it "underground economy."

571
00:53:31,350 --> 00:53:33,649
You know how much money
circulates within those circles?

572
00:53:33,778 --> 00:53:37,619
No less than 18 percent of our GDP!

573
00:53:37,796 --> 00:53:40,539
Why beat around the bush
and make things complicated?

574
00:53:40,767 --> 00:53:46,056
Just say that you have complaints
against the current tax investigations.

575
00:53:46,197 --> 00:53:47,290
What?!

576
00:53:47,384 --> 00:53:52,752
There are plenty of, as you call them,
"complaints" about you in the political arena.

577
00:53:53,253 --> 00:53:55,735
Baekpa is really something, all right.

578
00:53:56,138 --> 00:53:59,916
But I'm afraid he's not going to
affect my convictions in the slightest.

579
00:54:00,262 --> 00:54:01,739
Convictions?!

580
00:54:01,863 --> 00:54:04,359
If someone makes that much
money through illegal means,

581
00:54:04,485 --> 00:54:06,858
it's only natural that he should
pay taxes like everyone else.

582
00:54:06,987 --> 00:54:08,978
Think I can't see through it,

583
00:54:09,125 --> 00:54:11,674
that those convictions only begin
whenever your pockets are filled enough?

584
00:54:11,745 --> 00:54:13,025
I'd watch my language if I were you.

585
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:16,464
Our country is in turmoil
right now. It's a mess.

586
00:54:16,561 --> 00:54:20,835
Throwing the economy in the grinder 
as well is not what I'd call wise.

587
00:54:20,929 --> 00:54:23,491
You know what Baekpa's
greatest mistake was?

588
00:54:23,598 --> 00:54:26,591
Trying to challenge this
country's highest authority.

589
00:54:26,684 --> 00:54:27,586
What?!

590
00:54:27,703 --> 00:54:30,828
And you'd be that highest authority?

591
00:54:31,474 --> 00:54:33,412
That's what my duties state.

592
00:54:33,623 --> 00:54:35,632
I know how much of an honor it is.

593
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:38,494
That's my conviction.

594
00:54:42,396 --> 00:54:46,356
That fella...

595
00:54:54,109 --> 00:54:56,443
This country is a mess...

596
00:54:56,737 --> 00:55:02,481
Dealing with politics these days 
feels like a useless chore.

597
00:55:03,328 --> 00:55:07,403
I can't take Jo Pilyeon's
arrogance any longer.

598
00:55:07,759 --> 00:55:09,177
So?

599
00:55:10,284 --> 00:55:14,158
We'll have to destroy him
politically once and for all.

600
00:55:14,651 --> 00:55:16,274
Look, Congressman Min.

601
00:55:16,568 --> 00:55:20,914
Don't you know who's
backing Jo Pilyeon right now?

602
00:55:21,442 --> 00:55:26,153
Unless this world changes first, 
he's untouchable.

603
00:55:26,399 --> 00:55:27,985
<i>Congressmen.</i>

604
00:55:28,676 --> 00:55:32,907
Why don't you let me join the dance?

605
00:55:33,189 --> 00:55:41,024
I have a secret weapon 
that will shock you.

606
00:55:42,105 --> 00:55:44,182
A secret weapon?

607
00:55:44,450 --> 00:55:45,963
And what would that be?

608
00:55:46,072 --> 00:55:49,633
I cannot reveal it quite yet.

609
00:55:49,985 --> 00:55:54,747
Isn't something like that
used at the very crucial moment?

610
00:55:56,230 --> 00:55:58,549
Aren't you just putting
on airs for nothing?

611
00:55:58,743 --> 00:56:01,267
If I give you a condition,
would you believe me?

612
00:56:01,372 --> 00:56:03,066
A condition?

613
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:06,155
I want to enter politics.

614
00:56:06,519 --> 00:56:09,156
What... Politics?!

615
00:56:10,308 --> 00:56:13,378
You want to become a congressman?

616
00:56:13,581 --> 00:56:15,640
I'd appreciate your help.

617
00:56:16,295 --> 00:56:18,732
I'm sure that the weapon
I have in my hands...

618
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:22,473
more than warrants your help.

619
00:56:22,812 --> 00:56:26,829
Still believe I'm just putting on airs?

620
00:56:36,769 --> 00:56:38,367
All in.

621
00:56:40,246 --> 00:56:41,315
Listen.

622
00:56:41,432 --> 00:56:42,736
I think it's time to settle your debts?!

623
00:56:42,818 --> 00:56:45,426
And how much is that...

624
00:56:45,802 --> 00:56:48,628
Forget that, and bring me 
another ten million.

625
00:56:49,642 --> 00:56:51,205
Follow me to the other room, please.

626
00:56:51,357 --> 00:56:53,290
I will lend you the money.

627
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,645
You better stay put!

628
00:56:55,739 --> 00:56:58,546
Uh? I'll be right back with that money.

629
00:57:11,715 --> 00:57:14,639
Spare me... Please...

630
00:57:16,892 --> 00:57:18,843
I... I'll pay your money back.

631
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:21,211
I can just pay it back, can't I?!

632
00:57:22,832 --> 00:57:27,319
So your house is in
your mother's name, right?

633
00:57:29,068 --> 00:57:30,670
So how about it?

634
00:57:30,777 --> 00:57:33,332
Will you give us the house, 
or give up your body?

635
00:57:33,437 --> 00:57:35,234
Not the house.

636
00:57:35,305 --> 00:57:40,050
That's not mine, it's my mother's...

637
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:43,513
Then compensate by giving yourself up.

638
00:57:45,865 --> 00:57:47,386
<i>Give me some time.</i>

639
00:57:47,492 --> 00:57:50,440
I'll do whatever it
takes to find that money.

640
00:57:51,572 --> 00:57:54,854
There would be a way
to write off that debt...

641
00:57:55,007 --> 00:57:57,675
And what is that? Tell me.

642
00:57:57,796 --> 00:58:02,574
As long as you don't touch my house, 
I'll do everything you ask!

643
00:58:10,013 --> 00:58:12,472
You have a half-sister, don't you?

644
00:58:12,679 --> 00:58:14,833
Hwang Jeongyeon.

645
00:58:36,266 --> 00:58:38,133
You can go.

646
00:58:45,345 --> 00:58:47,128
I feel awkward, too.

647
00:58:47,213 --> 00:58:48,715
Ever since I was 
moved to a new business area,

648
00:58:48,814 --> 00:58:51,206
Director Yoo forced me to take them along.

649
00:58:53,285 --> 00:58:56,303
But what do I owe your call to?

650
00:58:56,432 --> 00:58:58,653
The tax investigations
you're going through...

651
00:58:59,569 --> 00:59:02,078
were orchestrated by Jo Pilyeon.

652
00:59:03,581 --> 00:59:05,848
This is a fight between money and power.

653
00:59:06,036 --> 00:59:09,137
Whomever wins, you'll both
suffer the consequences.

654
00:59:09,328 --> 00:59:10,958
I'm sure we will.

655
00:59:11,778 --> 00:59:19,261
But neither Baekpa nor
Director Yoo will ever surrender.

656
00:59:20,233 --> 00:59:23,337
This battle is like 
walking on a tightrope.

657
00:59:24,864 --> 00:59:30,530
A wrong step will make you lose your
balance, and fall down all at once.

658
00:59:30,882 --> 00:59:34,383
When even someone like me realizes that, 
there's no way they wouldn't.

659
00:59:34,582 --> 00:59:39,046
I'd prefer if you stayed out of this.

660
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:48,704
My life depends on this, too.

661
00:59:48,905 --> 00:59:51,124
And how are you going to handle Jo Pilyeon?

662
00:59:51,288 --> 00:59:55,395
<i>Now that the branches have started 
wavering, he'll attack the trunk.</i>

663
00:59:55,606 --> 00:59:59,142
You'll become a target of his as well.

664
00:59:59,743 --> 01:00:03,065
But I know how to stop him.

665
01:00:03,324 --> 01:00:04,569
What?

666
01:00:06,294 --> 01:00:07,807
I'm hungry?!

667
01:00:07,972 --> 01:00:10,627
I can order something, right?

668
01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:57,710
Hwang Jeongyeon and I 
have a lot left to settle.

669
01:00:57,886 --> 01:01:01,470
But with those stiffs sticking
to her now, it's not so easy.

670
01:01:04,312 --> 01:01:07,002
If you help me out just this once,

671
01:01:07,378 --> 01:01:09,563
I can write off a
month's worth of interests.

672
01:01:09,762 --> 01:01:11,130
How about it?

673
01:01:11,318 --> 01:01:12,728
Afraid I'll say no.

674
01:01:12,857 --> 01:01:13,856
What?!

675
01:01:14,028 --> 01:01:15,664
No?!

676
01:01:17,450 --> 01:01:19,811
Make that three months.

677
01:01:37,083 --> 01:01:39,175
You saw right.

678
01:01:39,727 --> 01:01:44,085
But why is Jeongshik riding with him?

679
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:58,366
Are you all right, Sir?

680
01:01:59,024 --> 01:02:05,883
Nobody within the organization
can learn of my condition.

681
01:02:29,362 --> 01:02:31,175
Have you found a solution?

682
01:02:31,312 --> 01:02:33,870
What solution are you looking for?

683
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:37,323
One that will make those
investigations stop, of course.

684
01:02:37,431 --> 01:02:38,477
How surprising...

685
01:02:38,571 --> 01:02:41,103
Our organization's very
survival depends on this.

686
01:02:41,185 --> 01:02:45,237
So let's hear proposals
that will at least sound tempting!

687
01:02:45,613 --> 01:02:47,769
We're counting on you, Sir.

688
01:02:47,879 --> 01:02:49,382
What are you, children?

689
01:02:49,489 --> 01:02:50,112
Sir!

690
01:02:50,218 --> 01:02:54,468
When will you stop acting like 
spoiled children crying for their toy?!

691
01:02:56,913 --> 01:02:58,967
We have no time to waste.

692
01:02:59,249 --> 01:03:02,232
Give us some kind of solution!

693
01:03:04,533 --> 01:03:07,458
<i>The solution is actually very simple.</i>

694
01:03:11,681 --> 01:03:17,367
Are you saying that you have one?

695
01:03:17,519 --> 01:03:19,081
<i>Exactly, Sir.</i>

696
01:03:19,305 --> 01:03:23,029
<i>There is a way to solve all this.</i>

697
01:03:26,517 --> 01:03:28,420
Open the doors.

699
01:03:31,075 --> 01:03:31,956
Sir...

700
01:03:32,050 --> 01:03:34,119
I said open them!

701
01:03:58,981 --> 01:04:00,865
Go ahead.

702
01:04:02,615 --> 01:04:06,468
Tell us what this solution of yours is.

<i>Whose idea was that?</i>

710
01:04:30,317 --> 01:04:32,479
You let Hwang Jeongyeon do that to us?

711
01:04:32,589 --> 01:04:34,489
If you want, I could get rid of her.

712
01:04:34,596 --> 01:04:36,624
If things go according
to Jo Pilyeon's plans,

713
01:04:36,734 --> 01:04:39,174
<i>our fight will become even harder.</i>

714
01:04:39,291 --> 01:04:43,271
What happened between you and Jo Pilyeon?

715
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:48,592
<i>What will he say when
he finds out about Wooju?</i>

716
01:04:48,684 --> 01:04:50,021
Can you lend me some money?

717
01:04:50,115 --> 01:04:52,946
And if I could find your birth mother,
how much would you give me?

718
01:04:53,086 --> 01:04:55,504
<i>The moment they learn that 
I'll soon pass away,</i>

719
01:04:55,598 --> 01:04:58,018
<i>many of them will try to betray me.</i>

720
01:04:58,124 --> 01:05:00,930
<i>Can you protect them for me?</i>
