~ All characters and events portrayed

4
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:10,747
The most important thing
for the both of us to convive...

5
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:12,058
{\a6}~ Episode 11 ~

6
00:00:10,896 --> 00:00:13,765
is to reduce the price of raw materials
in a way that satisfies us both.

7
00:00:13,876 --> 00:00:16,240
What else are you trying
to take away from us?

8
00:00:16,315 --> 00:00:18,244
Aren't you being excessive?

9
00:00:18,331 --> 00:00:20,334
<i>We need to make a living as well!</i>

10
00:00:20,421 --> 00:00:22,634
I'm still not done explaining.

11
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,663
Please let me finish.

12
00:00:24,761 --> 00:00:26,530
We have nothing else to listen.

13
00:00:26,629 --> 00:00:31,254
You're just asking us to sacrifice
to benefit Manbo Construction!

14
00:00:31,378 --> 00:00:32,404
That's right.

15
00:00:32,552 --> 00:00:34,964
We can't go any lower 
than this estimate!

16
00:00:35,075 --> 00:00:37,608
We need to make it if
you want to survive as well!

17
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,725
That's exactly what we should say.

18
00:00:39,849 --> 00:00:43,688
You need subcontractors
like us to survive!

19
00:00:43,812 --> 00:00:45,086
Isn't that right, gentlemen?

20
00:00:45,284 --> 00:00:48,289
That's right.

21
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:52,024
What are you wasting our time for?

22
00:00:52,197 --> 00:00:54,172
Let's just all go.

23
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:13,710
I think all the directors present today...

24
00:01:14,477 --> 00:01:21,613
will have to renegotiate their deals
with Manbo Construction from scratch.

25
00:01:21,977 --> 00:01:23,987
What is he talking about?

26
00:01:37,468 --> 00:01:38,844
Director Kim.

27
00:01:41,147 --> 00:01:45,433
In accordance with 
Miss Hwang Jeongyeon's requests,

28
00:01:45,829 --> 00:01:51,581
I plan to lower our service costs 
for this subway construction.

29
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,004
Indeed... This is it!

30
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,649
Chief Jo.

31
00:02:17,834 --> 00:02:20,033
You've done us proud.

32
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:24,679
You should direct
your compliments at them.

33
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,217
I wasn't the one who exposed
the subcontractors' price fixing,

34
00:02:29,102 --> 00:02:31,936
it was Hwang Jeongyeon 
and Lee Gangmo.

35
00:02:35,776 --> 00:02:36,919
I see.

36
00:02:37,092 --> 00:02:39,825
Ahh... The problems start now, really.

37
00:02:39,949 --> 00:02:44,030
Our bidding price must be lower
than Daeryuk Construction's.

38
00:02:44,154 --> 00:02:45,563
I will look into it thoroughly.

39
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:50,294
We certainly need to spare 
no effort in preparing this bid,

40
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:54,212
but there's a much quicker way.

41
00:02:55,862 --> 00:03:00,497
Find Daeryuk Construction's bidding price.

42
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:05,167
That figure will be kept
hidden in utmost secrecy,

43
00:03:05,341 --> 00:03:06,664
even Chief Jo couldn't possibly...

44
00:03:06,738 --> 00:03:11,240
I have no need for people who
only worry about saving their spot.

45
00:03:11,475 --> 00:03:16,224
Isn't it time you show
me something tangible?

46
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,528
I understand.

47
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,863
I'll find out.

48
00:03:21,853 --> 00:03:23,808
Good.

49
00:03:24,511 --> 00:03:27,161
Here... You can go.

50
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:35,500
<i>Gangmo, let's have a word.</i>

51
00:03:51,466 --> 00:03:53,659
Daeryuk Construction's bidding price...

52
00:03:53,975 --> 00:03:57,464
Gangmo, you find that out.

53
00:03:58,626 --> 00:04:01,100
Didn't you just ask Chief Jo?

54
00:04:01,969 --> 00:04:09,773
I'm sure Hong Gipyo will be trying
to find our bidding price as well.

55
00:04:10,045 --> 00:04:12,370
<i>When it comes to coping with 
insidious snakes like Chairman Hong,</i>

56
00:04:12,568 --> 00:04:18,608
Gangmo, you have much more 
experience than Chief Jo.

57
00:04:18,845 --> 00:04:20,495
I'll do it.

58
00:04:22,055 --> 00:04:23,655
You do that.

59
00:04:23,853 --> 00:04:25,596
Go.

60
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:34,414
President Ju.

61
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:38,548
Inform Chief Jo of all this.

62
00:04:38,709 --> 00:04:42,283
So you're trying to 
pit them against each other.

63
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:09,885
Are you asking me to find out
Manbo Construction's bidding price?

64
00:05:10,436 --> 00:05:13,026
I know it's shameless of me to ask,

65
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,722
but I'll have to count
on you one more time.

66
00:05:17,111 --> 00:05:19,949
I'll give it a thought,
and call you again.

67
00:05:30,945 --> 00:05:32,567
Yes.

68
00:05:33,647 --> 00:05:36,195
Ohh... Minwoo.
What's the matter?

69
00:05:36,368 --> 00:05:37,988
<i>Can you spare some time later?</i>

70
00:05:38,173 --> 00:05:40,647
<i>I have a favor to ask you.</i>

71
00:05:40,857 --> 00:05:42,453
A favor?!

72
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:47,206
All right.
I'll see you later.

73
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:16,306
What happened to you?

74
00:06:16,874 --> 00:06:19,967
Residents were filling agreements,

75
00:06:20,801 --> 00:06:23,567
when suddenly, 
Park Sotae, that prick...

76
00:06:27,947 --> 00:06:32,369
He might be threatening the
residents who signed the agreement.

77
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:35,355
Where is Park Sotae?

78
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:44,216
Where are you going?

79
00:06:45,424 --> 00:06:48,541
Something has come up 
at the building site.

80
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:55,667
Then, when you're done, come to
Hangang Hotel's restaurant at seven.

81
00:06:55,869 --> 00:06:58,932
Rest...aurant?

82
00:06:59,649 --> 00:07:00,527
Don't be late.

83
00:07:00,663 --> 00:07:03,742
You know I hate 
waiting for people, right?

84
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:27,994
Ahh... Really!
Mess up a perfectly fine shot, will you?

85
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,927
<i>Let's do it again.</i>

86
00:07:35,869 --> 00:07:37,557
Hyungnim... Look.

87
00:07:37,705 --> 00:07:41,292
Ahh... You bastard.
I told you to call me Chief.

88
00:07:41,391 --> 00:07:43,308
- Say it, Chief.
- Yes... Chief!

89
00:07:43,431 --> 00:07:44,977
- Let's hear it loud and clear... Chief!
- Chief!

90
00:07:45,088 --> 00:07:47,290
See how easy it is? 
But, what is it?

91
00:07:47,413 --> 00:07:49,060
There... Look!

92
00:07:49,986 --> 00:07:53,067
What the hell... Go after them!

93
00:07:59,609 --> 00:08:01,676
Stop them!

94
00:08:28,322 --> 00:08:29,791
Have you decided?

95
00:08:29,977 --> 00:08:31,349
Yes.

96
00:08:31,485 --> 00:08:35,121
Once the other guest arrives,
prepare the chef's special for today,

97
00:08:35,233 --> 00:08:37,471
and as for champagne...

98
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:39,301
Gangmo...

99
00:08:39,505 --> 00:08:41,119
Let's just talk it out.

100
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,777
<i>Talk...</i>

101
00:08:50,273 --> 00:08:52,895
G...Gangmo, I'm sorry.

102
00:08:53,068 --> 00:08:54,639
Don't...

103
00:09:03,349 --> 00:09:05,380
Everyone, stop!

104
00:09:11,698 --> 00:09:14,315
Go ahead and do it, you prick.

105
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:30,475
Spare me...

106
00:09:30,599 --> 00:09:32,739
<i>Gangmo. Gangmo...</i>

107
00:09:33,196 --> 00:09:35,187
Close an eye just this once.

108
00:09:35,373 --> 00:09:40,978
If I do, what will you do for me?

109
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:43,749
I'll stop interfering...

110
00:09:43,922 --> 00:09:46,173
with the residents' agreements.

111
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,077
Other than that,

112
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,052
there is something else 
you must do for me.

113
00:09:52,968 --> 00:09:55,565
That's all you need to know.

114
00:10:17,456 --> 00:10:21,538
What the hell were you doing,
letting them take the pool sticks?

115
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:37,704
Are you all right?

116
00:10:38,735 --> 00:10:41,043
That won't do it.
Let's head to the hospital.

117
00:10:41,204 --> 00:10:42,849
We have no time for that.

118
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:44,328
Go to the Hangang Hotel.

119
00:10:44,451 --> 00:10:45,626
Agasshi is waiting.

120
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,127
Shouldn't you get some stitches there?

121
00:10:48,217 --> 00:10:49,373
I said it's all right.

122
00:10:49,485 --> 00:10:53,096
<i>It's your flesh that got torn!
Your own head!</i>

123
00:10:53,232 --> 00:10:57,066
Think Jeongyeon will care
in the slightest if you're hurt?

124
00:10:57,645 --> 00:11:00,131
Should I just grab a taxi?

125
00:11:02,305 --> 00:11:04,022
All right.

126
00:11:05,003 --> 00:11:08,075
Find where Park Sotae lives.

127
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:09,918
What is it, again?

128
00:11:10,417 --> 00:11:14,926
Give that temper of yours a rest.
You taught them enough of a lesson.

129
00:11:24,571 --> 00:11:26,422
Do you have a reservation?

130
00:11:35,298 --> 00:11:37,367
Sit, let's have dinner.

131
00:11:37,527 --> 00:11:41,147
I'm just buying you dinner
to thank you for today.

132
00:11:42,692 --> 00:11:44,622
Let's go somewhere else.

133
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,357
I'll embarrass you, dressed like this.

134
00:11:48,517 --> 00:11:50,322
And who cares about that?

135
00:11:50,413 --> 00:11:52,153
Go ahead and sit.

136
00:12:07,261 --> 00:12:09,247
Promise me.

137
00:12:09,387 --> 00:12:12,023
That you won't try to 
help me behind my back again.

138
00:12:12,183 --> 00:12:16,574
You'll pardon me, 
but it wasn't really to help you.

139
00:12:22,048 --> 00:12:24,151
<i>It's the other way.</i>

140
00:12:24,608 --> 00:12:27,403
Fork with your left hand,
knife with the right.

141
00:12:33,828 --> 00:12:36,311
You've never eaten this, have you?

142
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:38,290
Take a look.

143
00:13:00,922 --> 00:13:03,137
How is it? Is it good?

144
00:13:06,238 --> 00:13:08,365
Why? Nothing special?

145
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:11,055
This place is famous for its steak?!

146
00:13:11,951 --> 00:13:13,399
Give me the fork.

147
00:13:13,734 --> 00:13:15,539
I'll get you a new one.

148
00:13:19,273 --> 00:13:21,219
It's good, why?!

149
00:13:24,555 --> 00:13:27,437
You really looked cool today.

150
00:13:29,026 --> 00:13:32,250
I'm glad we're friends.

151
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:39,600
I don't even want to imagine
living without you by my side.

152
00:13:39,798 --> 00:13:40,886
<i>How about you?</i>

153
00:13:41,022 --> 00:13:42,996
Like being by my side?

154
00:13:43,182 --> 00:13:45,704
Sometimes, I'm curious about that.

155
00:13:47,362 --> 00:13:48,673
The chairman will be worried.

156
00:13:48,809 --> 00:13:50,355
Let's finish and go.

157
00:13:50,589 --> 00:13:52,469
Ehh... Silly.

158
00:13:52,605 --> 00:13:56,707
Know what it means for a man 
to ask a date to leave early?

159
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:59,910
"Being with you is a total bore
and I've had it with that."

160
00:14:00,009 --> 00:14:01,592
That's what.

161
00:14:01,852 --> 00:14:06,366
Do you hate staying with me that much?
Does it bore you? To tears?

162
00:14:08,364 --> 00:14:09,706
Stop joking.

163
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:11,193
I'm not joking.

164
00:14:11,292 --> 00:14:14,508
I really want to 
have fun with you today.

165
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:27,371
Aren't you eating?

166
00:14:30,797 --> 00:14:34,309
Then, will you follow me 
to some other place?

167
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:36,688
Know a nice place?

168
00:14:45,388 --> 00:14:52,174
<i>{\a6}~ "Creek" by Shim Subong ~</i>

169
00:14:45,388 --> 00:14:52,174
What is the reason you do this?

170
00:14:52,483 --> 00:14:59,323
Sinking down the creek 
in all loneliness.

171
00:14:59,805 --> 00:15:06,804
Luxuriant weeds spurting all over,

172
00:15:07,002 --> 00:15:15,634
<i>As the dregs scatter about,
moved by the spring breeze.</i>

173
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:26,681
<i>It must have been a promise
from days long gone by,</i>

174
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:37,462
<i>Leading you there even if
your mind no longer desired to.</i>

175
00:15:37,857 --> 00:15:48,054
<i>Sitting by the creek
every single day,</i>

176
00:15:48,726 --> 00:15:59,688
<i>Vacantly abandoning
yourself in those thoughts.</i>

177
00:15:59,948 --> 00:16:10,931
<i>It must have been a promise
from days long gone by,</i>

178
00:16:11,091 --> 00:16:22,362
<i>It must be asking you 
not to ever forget it.</i>

179
00:17:05,462 --> 00:17:06,636
Ma'am.

180
00:17:06,847 --> 00:17:09,163
Time to head to the stage.

181
00:17:13,376 --> 00:17:15,352
I'm not in the mood tonight.

182
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:17,601
Send someone else.

183
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,228
Do you know her?

184
00:18:08,165 --> 00:18:10,455
No. Go ahead.

185
00:18:10,604 --> 00:18:12,261
All right.

186
00:18:24,602 --> 00:18:26,741
I can sit a moment, right?

187
00:18:30,033 --> 00:18:32,589
So you even come to places like this?

188
00:18:32,687 --> 00:18:33,535
That's surprising?!

189
00:18:33,684 --> 00:18:35,094
I have company.

190
00:18:35,217 --> 00:18:38,581
I don't want to be bothered,
so could you leave?

191
00:18:41,562 --> 00:18:44,979
Why do you get angry
every time you see me?

192
00:18:45,686 --> 00:18:48,479
They say there's only two
reasons why women get angry.

193
00:18:48,784 --> 00:18:50,841
Either they really hate you,

194
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:52,963
or they're interested in you.

195
00:18:53,698 --> 00:18:55,219
What?

196
00:18:55,598 --> 00:18:59,138
Whichever of the two, 
don't make it too obvious around me.

197
00:18:59,459 --> 00:19:01,339
It's just bothersome.

198
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,758
That's my seat.

199
00:19:07,993 --> 00:19:09,848
Please, leave.

200
00:19:15,397 --> 00:19:17,940
So you follow her around 
even to places like this?

201
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:20,598
Thought I asked you to leave that seat?

202
00:19:25,103 --> 00:19:26,850
I wanted a word with you.

203
00:19:27,258 --> 00:19:29,089
Let's head out a moment.

204
00:19:29,237 --> 00:19:31,166
Will just take a moment.

205
00:19:32,025 --> 00:19:33,801
I'm going.

206
00:19:40,355 --> 00:19:46,836
So the chairman asked you to find out
Daeryuk Construction's bidding price?

207
00:19:47,785 --> 00:19:49,903
Just a little piece of advice.

208
00:19:50,828 --> 00:19:55,897
You can struggle all you want,
but you won't get what you're looking for.

209
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:58,878
You better remember those words,

210
00:19:59,436 --> 00:20:02,440
as you'll soon find out what they mean.

211
00:20:09,452 --> 00:20:13,224
What do you do for a living?

212
00:20:16,637 --> 00:20:18,678
We're on the same side, aren't we?

213
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:21,196
That's what I believe.

214
00:20:21,837 --> 00:20:24,597
I can't stand women
who do nothing but talk.

215
00:20:25,054 --> 00:20:28,282
Unless I'm asking you something,
I'd prefer if you kept quiet.

216
00:20:29,362 --> 00:20:31,448
I'm sorry.

217
00:20:34,774 --> 00:20:36,394
Leave us alone.

218
00:20:38,142 --> 00:20:39,436
Bit late, right?

219
00:20:39,721 --> 00:20:42,402
- Sorry, Hyung.
- Nah, it's all right.

220
00:20:45,813 --> 00:20:47,837
You don't look too happy?!

221
00:20:48,233 --> 00:20:51,238
Is it because of that woman 
I saw down at the hall?

222
00:20:51,782 --> 00:20:56,061
It's filled with women out there,
why would I let anyone upset me?

223
00:20:56,902 --> 00:20:59,215
So what is this favor
you wanted to ask me?

224
00:20:59,734 --> 00:21:06,031
Find out Daeryuk Construction's bidding
price for the subway construction.

225
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:09,879
I'm well aware that
this is no laughing matter.

226
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:12,129
And that is why I asked you.

227
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:16,002
Why didn't you ask your father?

228
00:21:16,361 --> 00:21:19,452
At least for this, I don't want
to ask my father for any help.

229
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:23,830
Help me out.

230
00:21:25,018 --> 00:21:27,887
It's you asking,
how could I ever refuse?

231
00:21:28,107 --> 00:21:30,244
I'll find a way.

232
00:21:30,702 --> 00:21:33,444
- Thank you, Hyung.
- Let's drink.

233
00:22:04,068 --> 00:22:06,863
Ahh... I'm so hungry.

234
00:22:07,184 --> 00:22:11,045
Wonder if there's
even anything left to eat.

235
00:22:13,143 --> 00:22:15,592
<i>You're out of rice.</i>

236
00:22:16,704 --> 00:22:18,179
What...

237
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:20,293
What's with you?

238
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:24,895
Did you... come here to kill me?

239
00:22:26,716 --> 00:22:28,926
Have a seat.
Let's have a drink.

240
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:36,408
Sit down, you fool.
It's your place.

241
00:22:46,842 --> 00:22:48,252
Here, drink.

242
00:22:50,303 --> 00:22:51,635
You...

243
00:22:52,624 --> 00:22:55,271
You didn't put rat poison 
in there, did you?

244
00:22:55,432 --> 00:22:57,522
Am I like you?

245
00:23:00,601 --> 00:23:02,160
Here.

246
00:23:08,477 --> 00:23:09,516
Sotae.

247
00:23:09,751 --> 00:23:11,655
You'll have to help me out.

248
00:23:11,819 --> 00:23:12,719
To do what?

249
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:14,932
About the upcoming 
subway construction bid,

250
00:23:15,823 --> 00:23:20,069
find out Daeryuk Construction's
bidding price for me.

251
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:25,238
Are you asking me that seriously?

252
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:27,823
You even drive for Chairman Hong.

253
00:23:28,227 --> 00:23:29,592
You'd be more than capable 
of finding that out.

254
00:23:29,715 --> 00:23:33,349
Take a look at me.
I'm Sotae, Park Sotae!

255
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:36,206
Daeryuk Construction's Chief
of Goods & Services, Park Sotae.

256
00:23:36,342 --> 00:23:37,814
I know that.

257
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:40,696
And I know that you
were a close friend of mine.

258
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:42,303
Friend?!

259
00:23:43,008 --> 00:23:45,791
I don't need any of that,

260
00:23:46,496 --> 00:23:50,708
and unless they're putting food on
my table right now, I don't trust anyone.

261
00:23:50,983 --> 00:23:56,014
So, you're satisfied just living in this 
rathole, worrying about your next meal?

262
00:23:56,175 --> 00:23:58,920
Then, how about you?
Is your life any different?

263
00:23:59,032 --> 00:24:01,347
The world I dream of...

264
00:24:02,746 --> 00:24:05,911
is much bigger than people think.

265
00:24:06,739 --> 00:24:08,607
All that...

266
00:24:10,223 --> 00:24:12,898
Sotae, I want to dream it with you.

267
00:24:19,115 --> 00:24:22,966
This will be your last chance 
to join forces with me.

268
00:24:23,263 --> 00:24:25,712
<i>Next time I come here looking for you,</i>

269
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:31,240
it'll be as your enemy.

270
00:24:35,436 --> 00:24:36,805
Right...

271
00:24:37,254 --> 00:24:39,204
Bought you some briquettes and rice.

272
00:24:39,439 --> 00:24:43,294
Don't skip meals, you fool.
Want to get sick?

273
00:24:58,078 --> 00:25:01,122
<i>Yes, Ma'am! I'm coming.</i>

274
00:25:03,694 --> 00:25:07,182
I just saw the chairman off.

275
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:10,976
Were you surprised nobody
was home when you woke up?

276
00:25:11,124 --> 00:25:12,646
Rotten wench...

277
00:25:13,024 --> 00:25:15,260
What am I, a little baby, to let
something like that frighten me?

278
00:25:15,335 --> 00:25:17,951
You must be hungry.
What shall I make you for breakfast?

279
00:25:18,273 --> 00:25:21,946
What's with that smile
on your face all the time?

280
00:25:22,134 --> 00:25:25,296
Then, should I look sad instead?

281
00:25:26,001 --> 00:25:28,850
Neither smile nor look sad.

282
00:25:29,568 --> 00:25:32,511
I'll just smile, Ma'am.

283
00:25:59,499 --> 00:26:01,067
Chairman Hong?

284
00:26:01,624 --> 00:26:03,528
Don't turn.

285
00:26:04,932 --> 00:26:08,141
I was waiting for your call.

286
00:26:08,574 --> 00:26:12,927
I need a bait to find out 
their bidding price.

287
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:17,607
Hand me Daeryuk 
Construction's bidding plan.

288
00:26:18,696 --> 00:26:21,107
Are you telling me to disclose
our bidding price to you?

289
00:26:21,219 --> 00:26:23,717
If you want to find out
Manbo Construction's bidding price,

290
00:26:23,865 --> 00:26:26,388
wouldn't you need to
rewrite that plan from scratch?

291
00:26:26,586 --> 00:26:28,268
That's certainly true, but...

292
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:30,136
If you end up failing...

293
00:26:30,247 --> 00:26:32,209
If you don't trust me,

294
00:26:32,333 --> 00:26:34,683
then I can't help you, either.

295
00:26:37,156 --> 00:26:38,788
What do you want me to do?

296
00:26:38,986 --> 00:26:42,721
I noticed there's a mailbox
at the park near your house.

297
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:48,177
When I call you, put the
documents inside that mailbox.

298
00:26:48,745 --> 00:26:50,947
Using company employees
would be too suspicious,

299
00:26:51,244 --> 00:26:54,348
so send that young housemaid 
working for you.

300
00:26:58,862 --> 00:27:00,833
Let's do that.

301
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:22,630
Then, when will I be able to get my hands
on Daeryuk Construction's bidding plan?

302
00:27:25,471 --> 00:27:26,641
All right.

303
00:27:26,789 --> 00:27:28,706
Thank you, Hyung.

304
00:27:42,206 --> 00:27:46,254
Here's the status of our 
renegotiations with the subcontractors.

305
00:27:53,031 --> 00:27:56,038
Is anything wrong?

306
00:27:59,455 --> 00:28:00,893
Call in Chief Moon.

307
00:28:01,042 --> 00:28:03,255
If there's anything wrong, 
let me deal with it.

308
00:28:03,453 --> 00:28:06,617
I don't want anyone else
to take care of my duties.

309
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:10,985
Were you looking for me?

310
00:28:11,146 --> 00:28:13,744
The moment we find out Daeryuk 
Construction's bidding price,

311
00:28:13,857 --> 00:28:15,140
we'll get together.

312
00:28:15,264 --> 00:28:17,416
Can you find that out?

313
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:20,903
Prepare all our male employees.

314
00:28:21,089 --> 00:28:24,927
Also, look for a hotel 
with good security.

315
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,639
I'll get right to it.

316
00:28:26,837 --> 00:28:28,494
You're getting together?!

317
00:28:28,668 --> 00:28:30,362
Good job so far.

318
00:28:30,572 --> 00:28:32,402
Leave the rest to your colleagues.

319
00:28:32,587 --> 00:28:34,805
I'll join you as well.

320
00:28:37,204 --> 00:28:38,169
Hwang Jeongyeon.

321
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,209
No need to worry 
about me being a woman.

322
00:28:40,321 --> 00:28:42,176
This bid is not like the last one.

323
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,400
Preserving security is crucial.

324
00:28:43,549 --> 00:28:44,340
And?

325
00:28:44,476 --> 00:28:48,446
Until the bid is over, all our men will
have to stay together in the same room.

326
00:28:48,677 --> 00:28:49,994
And they won't be allowed 
to leave it, either.

327
00:28:50,155 --> 00:28:52,047
That's no problem.

328
00:28:52,467 --> 00:28:57,598
But our male employees could
feel uncomfortable because of her.

329
00:28:58,366 --> 00:29:02,170
I'll make sure that doesn't happen.

330
00:29:02,942 --> 00:29:07,634
Starting now, ignore
the fact I'm a woman.

331
00:29:11,134 --> 00:29:12,606
So?

332
00:29:13,125 --> 00:29:16,253
Are you telling me Jeongyeon
is even getting involved in this bid?

333
00:29:16,377 --> 00:29:17,082
Yes, Ma'am.

334
00:29:17,218 --> 00:29:19,852
And did you let that happen?

335
00:29:23,358 --> 00:29:24,935
I told you to make sure she
doesn't find her footing there,

336
00:29:25,034 --> 00:29:27,111
so why is she getting involved
in bigger projects by the day?

337
00:29:27,247 --> 00:29:28,521
I apologize.

338
00:29:28,843 --> 00:29:32,045
It was decided by Chief Jo Minwoo, so...

339
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,083
Mom.

340
00:29:34,256 --> 00:29:36,717
If this keeps up, is Jeongyeon
going to steal the company from me?

341
00:29:36,848 --> 00:29:38,461
I'll kill her if she even tries!

342
00:29:38,572 --> 00:29:41,582
Listen to what 
you're telling your mother!

343
00:29:41,874 --> 00:29:44,237
So do something, will you?

344
00:29:44,383 --> 00:29:47,007
Stop prancing around 
like some libertine.

345
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:50,792
Actually, I was going 
to meet someone soon.

346
00:29:51,142 --> 00:29:52,028
Who?

347
00:29:52,127 --> 00:29:55,102
Ehh... Shouldn't talk about it...

348
00:29:57,529 --> 00:30:01,238
I have this friend working as a
secretary for Daeryuk Construction.

349
00:30:01,411 --> 00:30:04,960
We're meeting, and I'll find out 
their bidding price through him.

350
00:30:05,505 --> 00:30:08,497
If you could only do that,

351
00:30:08,617 --> 00:30:12,160
you'd become the biggest
benefactor to our company.

352
00:30:12,503 --> 00:30:14,535
Can you really find that out?

353
00:30:14,745 --> 00:30:15,871
Who's this friend of yours?

354
00:30:16,031 --> 00:30:18,715
If I tell you, will you know?

355
00:30:19,779 --> 00:30:23,171
But to get this done, 
I'd need some ammo to throw at him...

356
00:30:23,284 --> 00:30:24,144
Ammo?!

357
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,734
Some money, what else?

358
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:28,368
Think he'd just bring me the
information free of charge?

359
00:30:28,566 --> 00:30:30,322
I'll get you all the money you need.

360
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:32,313
How much do you need?
Go ahead and tell me.

361
00:30:32,474 --> 00:30:35,838
All in brand new bank notes, 
about four big ones?!

362
00:30:36,271 --> 00:30:37,248
400,000 won?!

363
00:30:37,495 --> 00:30:39,572
Ahh... Really, how pathetic.

364
00:30:39,733 --> 00:30:41,364
Four million?!

365
00:30:41,458 --> 00:30:44,674
They don't call it bribe for nothing.

366
00:30:44,763 --> 00:30:47,488
Know how much money
we'll get by winning that bid?

367
00:30:47,698 --> 00:30:49,305
All right. Get up.

368
00:30:49,475 --> 00:30:51,185
Let's head to the bank.

369
00:30:51,569 --> 00:30:57,339
Also, Chief Moon. You find a way
to kick Jeongyeon out of the company.

370
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,166
Consider it done, Ma'am.

371
00:31:00,447 --> 00:31:02,066
<i>When did he say he would?</i>

372
00:31:02,177 --> 00:31:04,626
<i>He said he would contact me later.</i>

373
00:31:05,108 --> 00:31:09,899
Said to have my housemaid do it, 
to maintain secrecy.

374
00:31:11,556 --> 00:31:14,561
Let's give him that bidding plan.

375
00:31:14,697 --> 00:31:15,761
Will it be all right?

376
00:31:15,885 --> 00:31:19,916
Didn't you say he bears a
grudge against Hwang Taeseop?

377
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,473
Yes.

378
00:31:21,816 --> 00:31:25,764
Seeing how he's been acting,
it's clear he'll try to help us.

379
00:31:25,962 --> 00:31:30,105
Then, I'll count on you,
and go ahead with it.

380
00:31:30,266 --> 00:31:33,061
There is one thing 
that still bothers me.

381
00:31:33,185 --> 00:31:35,126
<i>What is that?</i>

382
00:31:35,275 --> 00:31:41,557
He's handling all this like a 
professional, it's all too perfect.

383
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,702
Could it be a KCIA employee?

384
00:31:46,875 --> 00:31:48,600
I can't say.

385
00:31:48,747 --> 00:31:53,208
None of the employees under me 
would be capable of this?!

386
00:31:58,241 --> 00:32:01,907
What? He asked Chairman Hong
to hand him his bidding plan?

387
00:32:02,019 --> 00:32:03,580
And who would that be?

388
00:32:04,732 --> 00:32:06,672
How am I supposed to know?

389
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,321
When is he giving it to him?

390
00:32:10,481 --> 00:32:12,423
Don't ask me.

391
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:15,683
So what the hell were you listening?

392
00:32:15,831 --> 00:32:19,343
Think it's that easy?

393
00:32:20,679 --> 00:32:27,976
But seems that this guy who's helping him
bears a grudge against Hwang Taeseop?!

394
00:32:28,214 --> 00:32:29,888
- A grudge?!
- Yeah.

395
00:32:30,123 --> 00:32:34,859
Also, they're going to let 
Chairman Hong's housemaid do that.

396
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:35,985
Housemaid?!

397
00:32:36,071 --> 00:32:39,448
To maintain secrecy or something...

398
00:32:39,596 --> 00:32:42,639
Know how pretty that young lady is?

399
00:32:42,763 --> 00:32:48,761
Didn't even know she was just a housemaid,
and I kept using deferentials.

400
00:32:50,727 --> 00:32:54,536
If I meet her again,
I'll treat her to some sausage soup...

401
00:32:54,759 --> 00:32:56,466
Hey, where are you going?

402
00:32:56,602 --> 00:32:59,418
At least pay for the coffee!

403
00:32:59,955 --> 00:33:03,042
"Just a look and my heart throbs."

404
00:33:03,178 --> 00:33:06,913
<i>"Just a thought and my heart throbs."</i>

405
00:33:07,061 --> 00:33:15,370
"Ignore the blooming first love
of an innocent nineteen-year-old."

406
00:33:17,809 --> 00:33:19,785
Must be her.

407
00:33:32,434 --> 00:33:37,467
But, can we really trust Park Sotae?

408
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,818
There might be a mole working for
Daeryuk Construction in our ranks.

409
00:33:40,942 --> 00:33:41,782
A mole?!

410
00:33:41,869 --> 00:33:45,616
Failing the bid at the last
moment was strange as well.

411
00:33:45,913 --> 00:33:47,892
So there's a traitor among us?

412
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:51,013
He said it was someone with a grudge.

413
00:33:52,291 --> 00:33:54,267
We must find who that is.

414
00:33:54,403 --> 00:33:57,606
But you don't even know 
when he'll come,

415
00:33:57,730 --> 00:33:59,845
do we really need 
to wait outside here?

416
00:33:59,993 --> 00:34:01,588
Can't be helped.

417
00:34:01,836 --> 00:34:05,993
Actually, I have somewhere
to go, so I need to go back.

418
00:34:06,134 --> 00:34:07,559
I'll send a few of the boys.

419
00:34:07,707 --> 00:34:09,006
No.

420
00:34:09,327 --> 00:34:12,345
That might actually alert him
that someone's spying on him.

421
00:34:12,506 --> 00:34:14,305
I'll just remain here by myself.

422
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:18,412
Ehh... What a fuss...

423
00:34:18,645 --> 00:34:20,858
It hurts, you wench!
Be gentle.

424
00:34:20,969 --> 00:34:23,686
Stay put, will you?

425
00:34:24,013 --> 00:34:26,678
Look at how dirty you are...

426
00:34:26,771 --> 00:34:27,598
What?

427
00:34:27,722 --> 00:34:29,305
Dirty?!

428
00:34:30,406 --> 00:34:31,494
<i>That's right, you wench.</i>

429
00:34:31,605 --> 00:34:36,155
My body is dirty!
So why are you even touching it?

430
00:34:36,412 --> 00:34:40,016
I also need to do the laundry,
and I'll be busy all day with chores.

431
00:34:40,165 --> 00:34:42,873
If you keep this up,
I won't help you bathe again.

432
00:34:43,022 --> 00:34:45,508
And who ever asked you to help me?

433
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:47,132
Wretched wench...

434
00:34:47,243 --> 00:34:50,261
Think I don't know you're
laughing at me deep down?

435
00:34:50,446 --> 00:34:52,933
Our Ma'am should just
make a business out of it.

436
00:34:53,034 --> 00:34:54,762
How can you tell so easily?

437
00:34:54,874 --> 00:34:56,494
Say what?

438
00:34:57,347 --> 00:34:59,282
Wait just a moment.

439
00:35:04,434 --> 00:35:05,847
Hello?

440
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:07,331
Yes, Chairman.

441
00:35:07,504 --> 00:35:10,794
You'll find an envelope in my study.

442
00:35:10,992 --> 00:35:13,848
Put that in the mailbox down the street.

443
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:16,524
I was bathing your wife...

444
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:18,129
It's urgent!

445
00:35:18,285 --> 00:35:19,786
Do this first.

446
00:35:20,019 --> 00:35:22,249
You must leave it inside that mailbox.

447
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:25,203
I need to run an
errand for the chairman.

448
00:35:25,327 --> 00:35:27,874
I'll be right back,
so wait just a moment.

449
00:35:28,011 --> 00:35:29,392
Where are you going?

450
00:35:29,489 --> 00:35:30,855
Hey!

451
00:35:31,251 --> 00:35:32,587
Come back here!

452
00:35:32,723 --> 00:35:34,219
Hey, you brat!

453
00:35:34,368 --> 00:35:35,950
Hey!

454
00:36:34,092 --> 00:36:36,820
I'm back, Ma'am!

455
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,074
I'm sorry, Ma'am...

456
00:36:53,272 --> 00:36:55,893
The chairman said it was urgent.

457
00:36:56,896 --> 00:36:58,330
Rotten wench.

458
00:36:58,453 --> 00:37:00,639
You're just like the others!

459
00:37:00,791 --> 00:37:05,073
You wag your tail when the chairman's
around, and then ignore me later!

460
00:37:06,458 --> 00:37:08,845
I apologize, Ma'am...

461
00:37:09,253 --> 00:37:10,391
What are you doing?

462
00:37:10,564 --> 00:37:13,520
Want me to die in the bathtub, 
soaked in water?

463
00:37:13,767 --> 00:37:16,692
I'll scrub you right away.

464
00:37:26,115 --> 00:37:28,454
But, you know?

465
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:33,672
It's easier to scrub the dirt
away when you're soaking wet.

466
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:35,441
What?

467
00:37:37,793 --> 00:37:40,582
I'll be good.

468
00:37:40,805 --> 00:37:43,328
Don't be angry.

469
00:37:45,667 --> 00:37:47,805
Rotten wench...

470
00:38:32,265 --> 00:38:33,852
Who are you?

471
00:38:34,869 --> 00:38:36,227
<i>Speak.</i>

472
00:38:36,319 --> 00:38:38,493
Who were you trying to give...

473
00:38:40,207 --> 00:38:41,642
Who are you?

474
00:38:43,002 --> 00:38:45,167
<i>Who's there?</i>

475
00:39:43,556 --> 00:39:46,866
<i>~ Subway Construction Bidding Plan ~</i>

476
00:39:51,434 --> 00:39:53,357
<i>Don't move.</i>

477
00:39:55,182 --> 00:39:57,178
It's a revolver.

478
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:00,625
Try anything funny, and you're dead.

479
00:40:01,235 --> 00:40:03,461
Give me those documents.

480
00:40:26,351 --> 00:40:27,975
By any chance,

481
00:40:28,309 --> 00:40:30,770
did Chief Jo Minwoo send you?

482
00:40:31,797 --> 00:40:34,752
I was sent here by him as well.

483
00:40:36,076 --> 00:40:37,956
Aren't you going too far?

484
00:40:38,302 --> 00:40:41,089
We're on the same boat,
so we shouldn't act...

485
00:40:41,484 --> 00:40:42,969
The moment you see my face,

486
00:40:43,105 --> 00:40:45,096
you will die.

487
00:40:48,877 --> 00:40:51,762
Hands above your head.

488
00:40:59,609 --> 00:41:02,372
You said I'll die if
I see your face, right?

489
00:41:02,656 --> 00:41:04,709
Go ahead and shoot, then.

490
00:41:04,895 --> 00:41:09,780
I'll have to see that face of yours.

491
00:41:25,134 --> 00:41:26,400
<i>Hey.</i>

492
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,640
<i>Are you all right?</i>

493
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:35,396
Ohh... Here you are.
How have you been?

494
00:41:36,774 --> 00:41:38,240
Sit.

495
00:41:40,263 --> 00:41:43,101
Bet you must be really busy, 
with the bid and all.

496
00:41:43,224 --> 00:41:44,597
Just get to the point.

497
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:48,903
If they find out I met with the
son of Manbo Construction's chairman,

498
00:41:49,064 --> 00:41:51,105
I'll end up in trouble.

499
00:41:52,985 --> 00:41:56,284
First, take this.

500
00:41:58,926 --> 00:42:00,572
What is this?

501
00:42:01,169 --> 00:42:05,159
With that money, you'll be able 
to get a really nice car.

502
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,225
Money?!

503
00:42:06,411 --> 00:42:08,624
What's with the surprised look?

504
00:42:08,884 --> 00:42:11,828
This is just a little deposit.

505
00:42:15,964 --> 00:42:18,883
Tell me your bidding price.

506
00:42:19,056 --> 00:42:22,296
I'll give you ten times
this money if you do.

507
00:42:27,812 --> 00:42:29,530
Acting all hard to get...

508
00:42:29,679 --> 00:42:33,772
You're the only righteous
one out there, aren't you?

509
00:42:35,801 --> 00:42:38,719
Was this not enough?

510
00:42:39,523 --> 00:42:41,341
Ehh... Whatever.

511
00:42:41,592 --> 00:42:43,330
Got a decent sum in
my hands thanks to you,

512
00:42:43,454 --> 00:42:46,321
so let's have a nice drink, shall we?

513
00:42:46,599 --> 00:42:48,549
You prick...

514
00:42:55,713 --> 00:42:58,486
It fits just right!

515
00:42:58,597 --> 00:42:59,468
How is it?

516
00:42:59,567 --> 00:43:02,300
Do I look elegant?

517
00:43:02,448 --> 00:43:04,526
You look just like Audrey Hepburn.

518
00:43:04,674 --> 00:43:07,704
What?! Audrey?

519
00:43:07,957 --> 00:43:09,807
Do you mean that?

520
00:43:10,582 --> 00:43:13,044
We have our own 
Shimcheong right here!

521
00:43:13,143 --> 00:43:17,632
She makes money, and even
buys her parents some gifts.

522
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,978
It's hard working 
at a factory, isn't it?

523
00:43:22,398 --> 00:43:25,243
Are they feeding you well 
at the dormitory?

524
00:43:26,556 --> 00:43:29,027
I'm doing fine, so don't you worry.

525
00:43:29,175 --> 00:43:31,575
Aigoo... My pretty daughter.

526
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,942
Have some of this.

527
00:43:34,139 --> 00:43:37,775
And I was so disappointed when
she dropped out of high school,

528
00:43:37,899 --> 00:43:40,731
- but seems she's finally grown...
- Did she drop out for the hell of it?

529
00:43:40,998 --> 00:43:46,382
With you ruining everything,
she just swayed a little!

530
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:50,002
Again with that... Aigoo...

531
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:53,197
<i>Go ahead and drink.</i>

532
00:43:53,394 --> 00:43:56,264
<i>Come visit us a little more often.</i>

533
00:43:56,831 --> 00:43:58,527
A gun?!

534
00:43:58,770 --> 00:44:01,111
He pointed a gun at you?

535
00:44:01,272 --> 00:44:06,330
Jo Minwoo might be trying to get
his hands on that bidding plan.

536
00:44:06,491 --> 00:44:07,938
Ahh... Right.

537
00:44:08,235 --> 00:44:10,671
Minwoo's father is a
director at the KCIA, right?

538
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:13,820
I tore that document a little.

539
00:44:14,154 --> 00:44:19,496
If Jo Minwoo takes that to the chairman, 
it will be a trap for sure.

540
00:44:19,632 --> 00:44:23,602
Hey... What if the KCIA 
takes you in for questioning?

541
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:28,286
They say that they make 
cripples out of people in there.

542
00:44:28,801 --> 00:44:30,361
For the time being,

543
00:44:31,519 --> 00:44:33,316
we'll have to keep
an eye on Jo Minwoo.

544
00:44:33,490 --> 00:44:34,912
Whatever.

545
00:44:35,048 --> 00:44:38,330
I don't want to get
shot to death on the street.

546
00:44:40,747 --> 00:44:46,763
Hey... Do you call that a skirt?
You can see all your thighs.

547
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:54,542
Gangmo Oppa.

548
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,610
Ohh... You came?

549
00:44:58,087 --> 00:44:59,974
Oppa...

550
00:45:00,221 --> 00:45:03,468
Are you dating Jeongyeon 
Eonni, these days?

551
00:45:04,141 --> 00:45:05,316
What?

552
00:45:05,947 --> 00:45:07,456
You're not, right?

553
00:45:07,690 --> 00:45:09,224
Don't even joke about that.

554
00:45:09,404 --> 00:45:11,760
What if she hears you?

555
00:45:13,023 --> 00:45:16,867
Then again, I never
thought you'd do that...

556
00:45:17,003 --> 00:45:18,487
But...

557
00:45:19,984 --> 00:45:21,418
Why are you asking that?

558
00:45:22,309 --> 00:45:24,226
No reason...

559
00:45:26,093 --> 00:45:27,886
By the way, Oppa.

560
00:45:28,084 --> 00:45:30,360
Tomorrow's my day off.

561
00:45:31,102 --> 00:45:33,105
Are you free?

562
00:45:34,887 --> 00:45:37,209
Want to go to Ddukseom Resort?

563
00:45:37,358 --> 00:45:39,567
Nami Island would be fine as well.

564
00:45:39,918 --> 00:45:41,451
I'll pay for everything.

565
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:44,630
I'm making a lot these days.

566
00:45:46,345 --> 00:45:47,895
Gyeongja.

567
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,012
Can you go sit over there?

568
00:45:52,173 --> 00:45:54,226
And cover your thighs.

569
00:46:02,833 --> 00:46:04,316
Oppa.

570
00:46:04,465 --> 00:46:06,815
I have something to tell you,

571
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,684
lend me your ear.

572
00:46:17,194 --> 00:46:19,375
You know...

573
00:46:26,115 --> 00:46:27,726
Agasshi.

574
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:31,508
- We need to talk.
- We have a work camp, let's talk later.

575
00:46:32,046 --> 00:46:33,853
Work camp?!

576
00:46:34,855 --> 00:46:38,342
What am I, a seed sack?
Always hurling me around...

577
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:46,564
- Agasshi.
- You can come in.

578
00:46:53,075 --> 00:46:56,040
How is this?
Was going to use it at night.

579
00:46:56,239 --> 00:46:58,221
Will it be uncomfortable?

580
00:46:59,279 --> 00:47:01,698
If it's not my bed,
I always have trouble sleeping...

581
00:47:01,834 --> 00:47:03,726
I'm worried.

582
00:47:05,341 --> 00:47:06,868
Take this.

583
00:47:07,177 --> 00:47:09,576
You're used to this,
so it'll make things better.

584
00:47:13,471 --> 00:47:14,695
Forget it.

585
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,725
Jo Minwoo is already
giving me enough stares as it is.

586
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:21,423
"Are you here for pleasure?"

587
00:47:21,596 --> 00:47:24,045
"Bring your bed while  you're there."

588
00:47:25,424 --> 00:47:27,721
It's obvious how he'd react.

589
00:47:29,564 --> 00:47:33,521
But what are you all 
getting together for?

590
00:47:33,843 --> 00:47:36,576
You still haven't found Daeryuk
Construction's bidding price.

591
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:38,629
Jo Minwoo found out.

592
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:39,371
What?

593
00:47:39,482 --> 00:47:44,297
Jo Minwoo found out Daeryuk
Construction's bidding price.

594
00:47:53,126 --> 00:47:55,154
Good job, Chief Jo.

595
00:47:55,327 --> 00:47:59,730
I knew you wouldn't disappoint me.

596
00:48:00,249 --> 00:48:01,659
I appreciate it, Chairman.

597
00:48:01,857 --> 00:48:05,715
Wait a minute...
These construction costs...

598
00:48:06,530 --> 00:48:12,586
Hong Gipyo did this on
purpose to ruin us, didn't he?

599
00:48:13,192 --> 00:48:16,608
Let's lower our bid
by five hundred million.

600
00:48:17,465 --> 00:48:19,214
Will it be all right?

601
00:48:19,499 --> 00:48:21,659
We'd already be losing
money offering that...

602
00:48:21,882 --> 00:48:26,532
We can just find a way to
compensate any lacking funds later.

603
00:48:27,137 --> 00:48:28,647
All right, Chairman.

604
00:48:29,028 --> 00:48:30,551
Right.

605
00:48:32,396 --> 00:48:34,026
Come in.

606
00:48:37,793 --> 00:48:40,947
Where did you find that bidding plan?

607
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:43,000
And why are you asking that?

608
00:48:43,173 --> 00:48:44,694
Answer me.

609
00:48:45,058 --> 00:48:47,267
Who gave it to you?

610
00:48:48,132 --> 00:48:50,376
What's the matter?

611
00:48:52,285 --> 00:48:55,817
That bidding plan is a fake.

612
00:48:56,052 --> 00:48:57,586
What?

613
00:48:58,105 --> 00:49:00,319
What are you saying?

614
00:49:00,467 --> 00:49:01,964
It's a fake?!

615
00:49:02,112 --> 00:49:05,004
Someone is helping Daeryuk
Construction behind our backs.

616
00:49:05,226 --> 00:49:07,774
If there's a spy within our ranks...

617
00:49:09,570 --> 00:49:10,952
So?

618
00:49:11,249 --> 00:49:13,722
Are you suggesting I'm the spy?

619
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:16,782
What are you doing,
with the chairman watching?

620
00:49:17,965 --> 00:49:20,505
Take a look at that document.

621
00:49:21,095 --> 00:49:23,819
There must be a few torn pages.

622
00:49:31,205 --> 00:49:33,518
And if there are no torn pages there?

623
00:49:33,753 --> 00:49:35,744
There is no way.

624
00:49:36,214 --> 00:49:37,883
Because I was the one who tore them.

625
00:49:38,032 --> 00:49:40,940
I can't find any?!

626
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:44,217
Gangmo.
Find them yourself.

627
00:50:14,516 --> 00:50:19,621
So what the hell did you tear,
to make all this commotion?

628
00:50:35,187 --> 00:50:37,622
A suite certainly feels different?!

629
00:50:37,745 --> 00:50:40,936
We'll have to start by assigning rooms,

630
00:50:41,084 --> 00:50:44,189
but with Hwang Jeongyeon...

631
00:50:45,759 --> 00:50:47,602
Let's go by the rules.

632
00:50:47,837 --> 00:50:48,715
<i>Yes.</i>

633
00:50:48,888 --> 00:50:51,335
<i>Then, we'll assign rooms 
based on rank.</i>

634
00:50:51,545 --> 00:50:53,227
The chief will take the bedroom,

635
00:50:53,326 --> 00:50:54,872
the other room will
be for Kim Daeri and me,

636
00:50:54,971 --> 00:50:57,778
the big sofa in the living room
for Park Daeri and Choi Daeri,

637
00:50:57,951 --> 00:51:00,425
and as for Hwang Jeongyeon...

638
00:51:01,815 --> 00:51:04,211
Get the small sofa in the living room.

639
00:51:05,185 --> 00:51:09,244
Until the bid is over, 
we will live here.

640
00:51:09,405 --> 00:51:14,154
Aside from me, leaving this suite
or even using the phone is prohibited.

641
00:51:23,310 --> 00:51:27,158
I appreciated the money you donated
to our national development fund.

642
00:51:27,628 --> 00:51:28,754
Allow me to apologize.

643
00:51:28,952 --> 00:51:32,070
I should have been 
a little more generous...

644
00:51:32,194 --> 00:51:35,990
I'm not the kind of man
who worries about figures.

645
00:51:36,139 --> 00:51:41,679
With patriots like you helping us, 
who would ever worry about this country?

646
00:51:41,877 --> 00:51:45,678
You're flattering me with
your kind words, Congressman.

647
00:51:46,073 --> 00:51:47,768
How are things at the KCIA?

648
00:51:47,879 --> 00:51:51,082
As you well know, Chief Cha
of the presidential guards...

649
00:51:51,268 --> 00:51:53,976
and our director 
are not on good terms.

650
00:51:54,137 --> 00:51:58,487
Listen to that... They should worry
about protecting the president.

651
00:51:58,635 --> 00:52:01,789
Why waste time arguing?

652
00:52:03,570 --> 00:52:08,331
Actually, I had something 
to discuss with you.

653
00:52:09,618 --> 00:52:10,446
What would that be?

654
00:52:10,632 --> 00:52:15,761
I'd like to be nominated for the Republican
Party at the next congress elections.

655
00:52:16,169 --> 00:52:18,111
You want to enter politics?

656
00:52:18,408 --> 00:52:19,929
Forget it, it's just a big headache.

657
00:52:20,052 --> 00:52:23,268
Look at me.
I'm losing hair because of all this.

658
00:52:23,441 --> 00:52:26,176
I'm not just kidding with you.

659
00:52:27,378 --> 00:52:31,185
I'd like you to
recommend me for the post.

660
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:37,331
If you want to run for congress,
it'll take quite the amount?

661
00:52:37,517 --> 00:52:41,883
You're a public official, 
where would you find all that money?

662
00:52:42,086 --> 00:52:45,096
You don't need to worry about that.

663
00:52:45,381 --> 00:52:50,031
Chairman Hwang 
will support my candidacy.

664
00:52:50,674 --> 00:52:52,368
<i>You really...</i>

665
00:52:52,517 --> 00:52:55,261
The other day, 
in this Blue House report,

666
00:52:55,422 --> 00:53:00,616
Chief Cha talked about this high-ranking
KCIA agent arguing with businessmen.

667
00:53:00,764 --> 00:53:05,538
If you keep this up, 
you'll force them to clamp down on you!

668
00:53:09,733 --> 00:53:12,537
It doesn't concern us.

669
00:53:13,336 --> 00:53:18,302
Since Chairman Hwang and I 
will soon become in-laws.

670
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:22,620
In-laws?!

671
00:53:23,078 --> 00:53:25,267
My son and Chairman Hwang's daughter...

672
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,134
will get married.

673
00:53:27,406 --> 00:53:29,496
<i>In-laws are helping each other out,</i>

674
00:53:29,669 --> 00:53:32,056
<i>who would ever point fingers at them?</i>

675
00:53:32,341 --> 00:53:34,631
Ahh... Well, if that's the case...

676
00:53:34,829 --> 00:53:39,281
Anyhow, this is very good news.

677
00:53:39,528 --> 00:53:41,482
My congratulations, Chairman Hwang.

678
00:53:41,804 --> 00:53:44,260
Yes.

679
00:54:00,970 --> 00:54:03,489
By the way.

680
00:54:03,910 --> 00:54:06,371
What did you mean earlier on?

681
00:54:06,606 --> 00:54:09,129
We'll become in-laws?!

682
00:54:09,649 --> 00:54:13,086
If we cut to the chase right away,
we'll avoid any future trouble.

683
00:54:13,717 --> 00:54:16,007
Be that as it may...

684
00:54:16,167 --> 00:54:20,533
Why? Did it upset you that much?

685
00:54:20,756 --> 00:54:23,353
I didn't mean that,

686
00:54:23,476 --> 00:54:28,126
but still, without first talking
to the two people involved...

687
00:54:28,275 --> 00:54:31,091
I'm not forcing this marriage on you.

688
00:54:31,375 --> 00:54:33,527
You winning the subway bid,

689
00:54:33,737 --> 00:54:35,778
and me becoming a congressman.

690
00:54:36,050 --> 00:54:38,486
That's what matters now.

691
00:54:40,868 --> 00:54:42,295
And you never know.

692
00:54:42,493 --> 00:54:46,138
Whether, despite our opposition,
our kids will fall for each other,

693
00:54:46,323 --> 00:54:49,291
and end up asking 
our permission to marry.

694
00:55:00,676 --> 00:55:05,438
What the hell does 
he take our family for?

695
00:55:05,710 --> 00:55:09,259
How dare he just throw those
words out there so lightly?

696
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:23,055
Hwang Jeongyeon.

697
00:55:23,191 --> 00:55:24,850
Are you sleeping already?

698
00:55:25,092 --> 00:55:25,775
What?

699
00:55:25,886 --> 00:55:28,409
How can you mess up the figures?

700
00:55:28,977 --> 00:55:30,301
I'm sorry.

701
00:55:30,449 --> 00:55:32,094
I'll do it again.

702
00:55:32,391 --> 00:55:35,458
Miss the mark even by ten won,
and our bid will be canceled.

703
00:55:35,891 --> 00:55:38,290
<i>Let's all wake up.</i>

704
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:30,709
Chief.

705
00:56:30,821 --> 00:56:33,059
We'd already be losing money this way.

706
00:56:33,207 --> 00:56:37,607
Trying to match those 67.6 billion
of total construction costs is unfeasible.

707
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:40,514
I'm looking for a way to compensate
for the missing construction funds.

708
00:56:40,625 --> 00:56:45,139
You just continue
focusing on the bidding plan.

709
00:56:52,602 --> 00:56:54,579
Let's continue tomorrow.

710
00:56:58,562 --> 00:57:02,030
Wrap things up, 
and let's sleep a few hours.

711
00:57:18,451 --> 00:57:21,626
How can one sleep with all this noise?!

712
00:57:33,339 --> 00:57:37,927
If I am to stay awake tomorrow,
I'll have to get some shut-eye this way.

713
00:57:38,443 --> 00:57:40,154
Hwang Jeongyeon...

714
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:43,278
You're really smart.

715
00:58:33,309 --> 00:58:35,486
What are you doing there?

716
00:58:35,758 --> 00:58:38,998
You still weren't sleeping?

717
00:58:39,332 --> 00:58:41,608
Quite the refined hobbies you have.

718
00:58:42,758 --> 00:58:46,975
It's a relief you haven't
taken your pants off, yet.

719
00:58:48,892 --> 00:58:50,339
What are you doing?

720
00:58:50,467 --> 00:58:53,361
You told me to erase the fact
you are a woman from my mind.

721
00:58:53,583 --> 00:58:55,562
I'll take a shower.

722
00:58:57,677 --> 00:59:00,731
Ahh... I need the bathtub, 
if you don't mind.

723
00:59:00,905 --> 00:59:03,403
If you don't want to get out,
we can just share it.

724
00:59:05,246 --> 00:59:08,004
Move... Out of the way!

725
00:59:19,697 --> 00:59:21,826
Why is it so cold?

726
00:59:22,506 --> 00:59:24,918
Feels just like someone I know.

727
00:59:36,556 --> 00:59:39,722
With this, I'll probably 
survive the night.

728
00:59:41,338 --> 00:59:43,272
Nasty bastard...

729
00:59:43,544 --> 00:59:46,063
Why do you think I went
to sleep in the bathtub?

730
00:59:46,223 --> 00:59:49,426
You even have to
take that away from me?

731
00:59:59,551 --> 01:00:02,721
How many degrees is this?

732
01:00:11,959 --> 01:00:17,006
He never gives up, does he?

733
01:00:18,426 --> 01:00:21,533
Do we really have to
spy on Jo Minwoo this way?

734
01:00:21,718 --> 01:00:23,511
I'm sure...

735
01:00:24,538 --> 01:00:27,735
he will meet with the man
who brought him the bidding plan.

736
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:32,192
If we want to stop him,

737
01:00:32,402 --> 01:00:34,789
we must catch him on the spot.

738
01:00:35,618 --> 01:00:39,625
I saw the lights were on in the suite.

739
01:00:40,656 --> 01:00:44,122
Guess they worked all night.

740
01:01:52,076 --> 01:01:54,426
Jo Minwoo...

741
01:01:55,192 --> 01:01:57,418
<i>Nitpicking snob...</i>

742
01:01:59,706 --> 01:02:02,959
Anal-retentive prick.

743
01:02:26,796 --> 01:02:28,571
Who...

744
01:02:36,655 --> 01:02:37,790
What... What is it?

745
01:02:37,975 --> 01:02:39,484
<i>What's wrong?</i>

746
01:02:42,515 --> 01:02:44,600
<i>This is killing me.</i>

747
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:47,326
It's three in the morning.

748
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:53,460
Wonder if we'll 
collapse before they do.

749
01:02:54,490 --> 01:02:58,394
Need to check the office,
once curfew is over.

750
01:02:58,567 --> 01:03:00,360
Get going.

751
01:03:00,533 --> 01:03:04,206
If anything happens,
I'll give you a call.

752
01:04:11,366 --> 01:04:14,286
Is peeping on people 
a hobby of yours?

753
01:04:15,807 --> 01:04:18,516
That...

754
01:04:21,834 --> 01:04:24,272
Unless you want your colleagues 
to misunderstand all this,

755
01:04:24,433 --> 01:04:27,104
I suggest you leave my room.

756
01:04:41,956 --> 01:04:45,827
Think I had a dream last night?

757
01:04:48,262 --> 01:04:51,218
And of all dreams, that?!

758
01:04:52,863 --> 01:04:53,741
It's a nightmare.

759
01:04:53,865 --> 01:04:56,425
Nightmare!
Nightmare.

760
01:04:56,586 --> 01:04:59,331
What about nightmares?

761
01:05:03,393 --> 01:05:05,968
Here...
Everyone, wake up.

762
01:05:06,216 --> 01:05:07,996
Let's start the meeting.

763
01:05:08,726 --> 01:05:10,556
<i>Wake up.</i>

764
01:05:27,326 --> 01:05:29,485
Gangmo! Gangmo.

765
01:05:29,683 --> 01:05:32,515
Jo Minwoo just left for the Royal Club.

766
01:05:32,691 --> 01:05:34,012
What?

767
01:05:36,770 --> 01:05:38,798
What's the matter, suddenly?

768
01:05:39,082 --> 01:05:41,222
Take a breather, first.

769
01:05:41,420 --> 01:05:43,483
What is this urgent matter about?

770
01:05:43,953 --> 01:05:47,366
I think there's a spy
in Manbo Construction.

771
01:05:47,502 --> 01:05:48,652
Spy?

772
01:05:48,776 --> 01:05:52,820
The son of Chairman Hwang met with
a secretary from Daeryuk Construction.

773
01:05:52,956 --> 01:05:54,045
Jeongshik?

774
01:05:54,143 --> 01:05:55,818
I dug into it,

775
01:05:55,954 --> 01:05:58,551
and turns out the guy might 
spin out of control any minute.

776
01:06:01,803 --> 01:06:03,955
You don't need to worry about him.

777
01:06:04,314 --> 01:06:07,962
He would never be 
aware of our bidding price.

778
01:06:08,135 --> 01:06:09,446
Good to hear, then.

779
01:06:09,558 --> 01:06:12,022
Just in case, thought I'd tell you.

780
01:06:12,914 --> 01:06:14,467
Is work proceeding well?

781
01:06:14,628 --> 01:06:16,434
Yes, of course.

782
01:06:16,657 --> 01:06:19,822
Just in case, I made sure 
the bid will be a little different.

783
01:06:20,503 --> 01:06:22,872
How much did you lower it?

784
01:06:24,582 --> 01:06:26,582
If it makes you feel uneasy,
no need to tell me.

785
01:06:26,768 --> 01:06:29,241
I don't want to be
misunderstood for nothing.

786
01:06:34,163 --> 01:06:38,541
<i>{\a6}*676 AD = 676eok won = 67.6 billion won</i>

787
01:06:34,163 --> 01:06:38,541
Know what year Shilla
unified the Three Kingdoms*?

788
01:06:39,135 --> 01:06:40,434
Not really?!

789
01:06:40,780 --> 01:06:43,525
If we win that subway construction bid,

790
01:06:43,896 --> 01:06:48,670
Manbo Construction will unify
our country's construction business.

791
01:06:51,075 --> 01:06:57,543
So your bidding price is just like
the year the Three Kingdoms were unified?

792
01:06:57,914 --> 01:07:00,474
You sure are KCIA...

793
01:07:00,709 --> 01:07:02,923
Didn't try to fix it 
that way on purpose,

794
01:07:03,114 --> 01:07:05,031
but that's how it turned out.

795
01:07:05,834 --> 01:07:09,273
Sounds like a good omen.
I wish you luck.

796
01:07:11,486 --> 01:07:15,708
I'm sure I don't need to say this, 
but keep it secret.

797
01:07:16,039 --> 01:07:20,123
If Director Jo asks me, I'm not 
sure I can keep my mouth shut?!

798
01:07:20,358 --> 01:07:22,611
Could it be otherwise?

799
01:07:45,699 --> 01:07:47,061
He's here again?!

800
01:07:47,185 --> 01:07:49,906
What if he finds out?

801
01:08:31,799 --> 01:08:34,792
