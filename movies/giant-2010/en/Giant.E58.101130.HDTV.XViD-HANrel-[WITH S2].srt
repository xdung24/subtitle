Episode 58

4
00:00:23,978 --> 00:00:25,731
What's wrong, Gangmo?

5
00:00:26,179 --> 00:00:29,489
Why, did anyone throw insults at you?

6
00:00:29,576 --> 00:00:31,142
Nah...

7
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:33,042
I think I've just
seen Jo Minwoo pass by.

8
00:00:33,129 --> 00:00:34,449
Jo Minwoo?!

9
00:00:34,557 --> 00:00:37,117
And why would Jo Minwoo be here?

10
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,006
How could you let things get to this point?

11
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:48,661
Was my father really the one
who killed Congressman Oh?

12
00:00:48,806 --> 00:00:50,750
And why... Why?!

13
00:00:50,859 --> 00:00:51,873
Minwoo...

14
00:00:51,967 --> 00:00:56,286
First... First we must get
your father out of trouble.

15
00:00:56,735 --> 00:01:01,448
Seongmo Hyung was there.

16
00:01:01,709 --> 00:01:03,072
What?!

17
00:01:03,464 --> 00:01:05,929
He was there with Lee Gangmo.

18
00:01:06,568 --> 00:01:08,657
He didn't find out, did he?

19
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:10,499
I don't know.

20
00:01:10,615 --> 00:01:12,297
What's that supposed to mean?

21
00:01:12,671 --> 00:01:14,632
Did he see you or not?

22
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:17,213
I just told you I have no idea!

23
00:01:17,373 --> 00:01:19,098
Minwoo.

24
00:01:23,153 --> 00:01:27,601
I'll call you again later tonight.

25
00:01:52,553 --> 00:01:54,133
Hello?

26
00:01:54,558 --> 00:01:56,186
Chief Oh.

27
00:01:56,644 --> 00:01:58,738
It's me, Go Jaechun.

28
00:02:05,569 --> 00:02:08,817
Did anyone come visit Congressman Jo?

29
00:02:09,064 --> 00:02:10,340
No.

30
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,506
Does he know about the tape?

31
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:15,428
He still doesn't.

32
00:02:37,728 --> 00:02:39,366
You...

33
00:02:40,454 --> 00:02:42,064
And you.

34
00:02:42,905 --> 00:02:43,934
Right.

35
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:45,395
There was one more.

36
00:02:45,511 --> 00:02:47,469
Lee Miju.

37
00:02:48,325 --> 00:02:51,283
I made a mistake.

38
00:02:51,649 --> 00:02:57,606
I should have dealt with
you all from the very beginning...

39
00:02:58,433 --> 00:03:00,305
I sure made a big mistake.

40
00:03:00,403 --> 00:03:03,787
Is that all the soul-searching you
can do? You've left out all the substance.

41
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,108
About all the vile and despicable
things you've done over the...

42
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:10,762
I know no such thing as soul searching.

43
00:03:11,096 --> 00:03:13,518
And I have never
regretted anything I've done.

44
00:03:13,896 --> 00:03:15,591
I'm just...

45
00:03:15,925 --> 00:03:17,347
disappointed I let this happen.

46
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:20,732
I wonder if you'll say
the same thing in court.

47
00:03:21,436 --> 00:03:26,482
I can prove every single heinous crime
you committed over the last twenty years.

48
00:03:26,596 --> 00:03:28,470
What do you think he will get, Hyung?

49
00:03:28,615 --> 00:03:29,804
Can't say...

50
00:03:29,964 --> 00:03:32,443
A life sentence is a given,

51
00:03:32,707 --> 00:03:36,512
but we'll have to see if we can
turn that into capital punishment.

52
00:03:37,935 --> 00:03:39,891
See you in court,

53
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:42,211
Congressman Jo Pilyeon.

54
00:03:46,688 --> 00:03:49,414
You better take
good care of that tape!

55
00:03:50,968 --> 00:03:53,419
Because if you really
want things to go your way,

56
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:56,102
the evidence needs to be crystal clear.

57
00:03:56,316 --> 00:04:01,264
Play with fire without
a plan, and you'll die for it.

58
00:04:12,692 --> 00:04:15,307
We must find that tape, Hyung.

59
00:04:16,277 --> 00:04:18,222
Gangmo.

60
00:04:19,455 --> 00:04:22,467
Find where Go Jaechun might be hiding.

61
00:04:23,049 --> 00:04:29,572
He must be injured,
so look for hospitals or inns.

62
00:04:29,964 --> 00:04:31,100
How about you?

63
00:04:31,211 --> 00:04:32,947
I need to go somewhere.

64
00:04:33,097 --> 00:04:36,070
See you at Miju's place this evening.

65
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,768
- Letter of Resignation -

66
00:05:08,964 --> 00:05:12,532
You're suggesting we
get rid of Lee Seongmo?

67
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,213
If he finds that tape,

68
00:05:18,343 --> 00:05:21,447
it's all over for the both of us!

69
00:05:27,192 --> 00:05:29,521
This is where Go Jaechun is hiding.

70
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:31,615
Go meet him.

71
00:05:50,006 --> 00:05:54,705
Seongmo Hyung was there.

72
00:05:54,893 --> 00:05:57,678
He was there with Lee Gangmo.

73
00:06:03,471 --> 00:06:05,067
It's me.

74
00:06:13,736 --> 00:06:15,514
You brought your gun?

75
00:06:15,618 --> 00:06:16,556
Give it to me.

76
00:06:16,664 --> 00:06:18,335
You can't use that.

77
00:06:18,426 --> 00:06:21,202
Then, will you get rid
of Lee Seongmo instead?

78
00:06:22,884 --> 00:06:26,379
It's the only thing that can save us!

79
00:06:28,003 --> 00:06:30,251
Give me that gun.

80
00:07:13,672 --> 00:07:15,048
And Seongmo?

81
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:16,416
He didn't come?!

82
00:07:16,521 --> 00:07:18,775
Weren't you coming here together?

83
00:07:29,668 --> 00:07:30,674
It's me, Hyung.

84
00:07:30,788 --> 00:07:32,293
Where are you now?

85
00:07:33,246 --> 00:07:35,266
I have a strange presentiment...

86
00:07:35,585 --> 00:07:38,575
that someone might come here tonight.

87
00:07:38,793 --> 00:07:40,328
I'll come there right now.

88
00:07:40,421 --> 00:07:41,564
No.

89
00:07:41,671 --> 00:07:42,768
No need.

90
00:07:42,876 --> 00:07:44,521
Wait for me, Hyung.

91
00:07:46,145 --> 00:07:47,940
I'll be right back, Miju.

92
00:07:49,611 --> 00:07:50,718
Oppa...

93
00:07:50,815 --> 00:07:52,837
Gangmo Oppa!

94
00:09:04,943 --> 00:09:07,801
I was right behind him...

95
00:09:09,425 --> 00:09:12,169
Where on earth did he go?

96
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,112
Give me that tape.

97
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:26,752
Give it to me, Minwoo.

98
00:09:27,013 --> 00:09:29,959
From the very first moment
you entered our house,

99
00:09:31,873 --> 00:09:35,528
you planned to get revenge
against us, didn't you?

100
00:09:37,225 --> 00:09:40,720
Right as I was treating
you like my own brother,

101
00:09:43,243 --> 00:09:49,235
you were gritting your teeth, waiting
for the day when you'd kill my father.

102
00:09:49,341 --> 00:09:51,166
There is no time.

103
00:09:52,094 --> 00:09:54,240
Give me that tape.

104
00:09:54,733 --> 00:09:56,981
Forget everyone else,

105
00:09:58,112 --> 00:10:00,545
but you knew.

106
00:10:01,989 --> 00:10:06,082
How hard I tried not
to become like my father!

107
00:10:06,764 --> 00:10:10,157
How much I love Miju!

108
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:17,585
And despite knowing all that,

109
00:10:18,672 --> 00:10:20,862
you still betrayed me?

110
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,259
Give me that tape right now.

111
00:10:38,607 --> 00:10:39,709
Do it!

112
00:10:39,912 --> 00:10:41,580
Shoot if you want.

113
00:10:41,739 --> 00:10:43,132
Since you're not getting anything from me!

114
00:10:43,219 --> 00:10:45,176
Jo Minwoo.

115
00:11:30,168 --> 00:11:33,111
Resent your father instead.

116
00:11:33,415 --> 00:11:40,006
Because all this was caused by him.

117
00:11:54,435 --> 00:11:56,311
Hyung!

118
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:05,128
Have you ever been sincere
with me even for a single second?

119
00:12:07,521 --> 00:12:09,684
I'm sorry.

120
00:12:28,128 --> 00:12:30,398
Don't move.

121
00:12:32,037 --> 00:12:33,531
Drop that gun.

122
00:12:33,618 --> 00:12:35,227
Do it!

123
00:12:40,036 --> 00:12:42,745
Hands over your head.

124
00:12:49,172 --> 00:12:51,577
Stay put... Don't you dare move!

125
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,204
What happened?

126
00:13:26,334 --> 00:13:29,646
After hearing the gunshots,
the police will be here soon.

127
00:13:29,753 --> 00:13:31,049
I asked you what
happened to Seongmo!

128
00:13:31,107 --> 00:13:33,630
Get out of here right now!

129
00:14:05,824 --> 00:14:06,984
Yes.

130
00:14:07,272 --> 00:14:08,594
Where are you, Hyung?

131
00:14:08,912 --> 00:14:10,191
Everything all right?

132
00:14:10,297 --> 00:14:11,480
Yeah.

133
00:14:11,924 --> 00:14:15,859
I faced a little disturbance,
but now it's all right.

134
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:18,818
Gangmo.

135
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:22,765
I found the tape!

136
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:24,839
Really, Hyung?

137
00:14:24,926 --> 00:14:26,006
That's right.

138
00:14:26,104 --> 00:14:27,913
We won.

139
00:14:28,694 --> 00:14:33,323
Now we can finally avenge our parents.

140
00:14:33,845 --> 00:14:35,539
Hyung...

141
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:43,907
But why...

142
00:14:44,023 --> 00:14:46,184
do I suddenly feel so tired...

143
00:14:48,736 --> 00:14:54,291
Gangmo... Miju...

144
00:14:56,242 --> 00:14:57,647
Hyung.

145
00:14:58,067 --> 00:14:59,097
What's wrong, Hyung?

146
00:14:59,184 --> 00:15:00,455
Hyung!

147
00:15:00,547 --> 00:15:02,775
Hyung! Answer me!

148
00:15:16,053 --> 00:15:17,551
Hyung!

149
00:15:17,676 --> 00:15:19,455
Answer me, Hyung!

150
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:20,847
Seongmo Hyung!!

151
00:15:20,952 --> 00:15:22,550
Hyung!!

152
00:15:22,884 --> 00:15:24,928
Hyung!!

153
00:15:25,581 --> 00:15:27,684
Hyung!!

154
00:16:01,326 --> 00:16:03,709
Minwoo, it's you.

155
00:16:06,863 --> 00:16:10,110
Chief Oh called me.

156
00:16:12,111 --> 00:16:16,404
You took care of Lee
Seongmo's body, I hope?

157
00:16:20,087 --> 00:16:21,762
Jaechun saved me.

158
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:26,178
Without any evidence they
can use, everything is solved.

159
00:16:27,976 --> 00:16:29,760
Seongmo Hyung...

160
00:16:30,891 --> 00:16:32,979
is nowhere to be found.

161
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:34,705
What are you trying to say?

162
00:16:34,807 --> 00:16:36,503
I didn't find him inside the car.

163
00:16:36,619 --> 00:16:41,946
Are you telling me you couldn't
verify whether he was dead or not?

164
00:16:42,714 --> 00:16:45,340
Then, the videotape?

165
00:16:45,456 --> 00:16:46,722
Where is that tape?

166
00:16:46,815 --> 00:16:48,951
It disappeared along with him.

167
00:16:51,184 --> 00:16:55,645
What the hell are you saying?

168
00:17:00,807 --> 00:17:04,723
So what you're saying is
that, when you got there,

169
00:17:04,897 --> 00:17:07,970
you only found the car
but Seongmo had disappeared?

170
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:09,468
Yes.

171
00:17:09,592 --> 00:17:12,952
People living in the surroundings
claim they heard gunshots,

172
00:17:13,072 --> 00:17:16,457
not to mention that we found
bullet holes all over the car as well.

173
00:17:16,565 --> 00:17:19,879
Seems like a shootout took place that night.

174
00:17:20,024 --> 00:17:24,091
So we can only deduce that
someone moved Seongmo elsewhere.

175
00:17:24,215 --> 00:17:26,144
Many hints point at...

176
00:17:26,275 --> 00:17:29,683
- the possibility of murder...
- No way.

177
00:17:30,263 --> 00:17:32,511
My brother is not dead yet.

178
00:17:33,874 --> 00:17:36,167
Here are photos I personally shot.

179
00:17:36,272 --> 00:17:41,125
As you can see, there
are blood stains on this handle.

180
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,779
It's a clear sign that, after being shot,

181
00:17:46,025 --> 00:17:48,143
he tried to get out of the car by himself.

182
00:17:48,426 --> 00:17:50,521
Everyone, gather here.

183
00:17:52,711 --> 00:17:55,162
- Find all witnesses in the area.
- Yes.

184
00:17:55,234 --> 00:17:57,722
Send inquiries to
all nearby hospitals as well.

185
00:17:57,827 --> 00:17:59,926
- Yes, Sir.
- All right.

186
00:18:07,076 --> 00:18:11,281
If he had a gun, there's a good
chance it could be an ANSP agent.

187
00:18:11,398 --> 00:18:16,546
In his last call to me,
he said he had the videotape.

188
00:18:18,251 --> 00:18:23,946
Someone brought harm to
him to destroy that evidence.

189
00:18:24,056 --> 00:18:27,161
So is it Jo Pilyeon, after all?

190
00:18:27,277 --> 00:18:29,960
That Go Jaechun still hasn't been caught.

191
00:18:30,858 --> 00:18:33,349
Be it ANSP or Go Jaechun,

192
00:18:33,789 --> 00:18:36,003
we must hurry up and find my brother.

193
00:18:36,473 --> 00:18:40,615
That's the only way to expose
Jo Pilyeon for his murders.

194
00:19:00,293 --> 00:19:01,946
Then...

195
00:19:03,036 --> 00:19:05,290
You still don't know where he is?

196
00:19:05,522 --> 00:19:07,341
We're still investigating,

197
00:19:07,466 --> 00:19:09,945
but we can't confirm whether he's still alive.

198
00:19:12,816 --> 00:19:19,081
So you're saying that
my brother might be dead?!

199
00:19:24,548 --> 00:19:26,564
All right...

200
00:19:41,911 --> 00:19:43,984
Drink some of this.

201
00:19:57,813 --> 00:20:01,399
Seongmo took that tape and disappeared?!

202
00:20:01,526 --> 00:20:03,990
Does that make any sense?

203
00:20:04,781 --> 00:20:06,034
Find him.

204
00:20:06,123 --> 00:20:09,242
Find Lee Seongmo right now!

205
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:14,546
Get a hold of yourself, I beg you!

206
00:20:15,373 --> 00:20:18,665
Don't you realize we're being punished?

207
00:20:18,774 --> 00:20:22,378
You and I are finally paying
for everything we did!

208
00:20:25,496 --> 00:20:28,947
The dream I worked my entire life
to fulfill is about to vanish under my eyes,

209
00:20:29,092 --> 00:20:31,862
and that's all you can tell to your father?

210
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,546
You tell me to wake up?
That I'm being punished?!

211
00:20:36,619 --> 00:20:37,997
Find that damn tape.

212
00:20:38,084 --> 00:20:43,180
Find it whatever it takes,
and get rid of the evidence.

213
00:20:43,383 --> 00:20:45,622
Are you happy?

214
00:20:45,717 --> 00:20:46,994
What?

215
00:20:47,151 --> 00:20:50,112
Is living this way making you happy?

216
00:20:59,072 --> 00:21:00,932
Minwoo...

217
00:21:01,223 --> 00:21:04,949
You're the only one I have left.

218
00:21:05,093 --> 00:21:07,429
If you let weakness get the better of you,

219
00:21:07,589 --> 00:21:10,721
then my life will end in failure.

220
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:14,128
Minwoo.

221
00:21:14,266 --> 00:21:16,835
Once we fulfill all our goals,

222
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:20,011
then people will only remember us as winners.

223
00:21:20,229 --> 00:21:25,217
"Punishment" is only what people jealous
of winners use to justify their pathetic lives.

224
00:21:25,377 --> 00:21:27,164
So find that tape.

225
00:21:27,277 --> 00:21:29,617
Only then you will win.

226
00:21:34,272 --> 00:21:36,448
Dad...

227
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,958
Dad...

228
00:21:41,697 --> 00:21:43,539
Dad.

229
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:46,496
Dad!!

230
00:21:54,914 --> 00:21:56,571
- Congressman Jo Pilyeon
Murder Case Remitted for Rehearing -

231
00:21:56,663 --> 00:21:59,191
- One man's scary tenacity to obtain power -

232
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:02,368
- Missing -
Lee Seongmo (34, Male)

233
00:22:08,749 --> 00:22:10,387
Hello?

234
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:12,345
Yes, Dad.

235
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,840
Now?

236
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,466
Yes... All right.

237
00:22:21,105 --> 00:22:23,324
Is anything the matter?

238
00:22:23,774 --> 00:22:26,369
Dad told me to go to his house?

239
00:22:47,755 --> 00:22:51,538
What are you doing...
Jeongyeon should be here soon.

240
00:22:52,568 --> 00:22:54,946
Are you confident?

241
00:22:56,382 --> 00:23:05,127
Are you confident you'll be able
to tell Jeongyeon that you're her mother?

242
00:23:05,499 --> 00:23:07,939
It'll shock her so much...

243
00:23:08,327 --> 00:23:10,767
And what if she doesn't like it...

244
00:23:13,611 --> 00:23:15,480
This won't do it.

245
00:23:15,638 --> 00:23:18,149
Not to mention how awkward
it'll be seeing me like this...

246
00:23:18,337 --> 00:23:20,179
I'll just go get changed.

247
00:23:20,353 --> 00:23:22,311
Jeongyeon...

248
00:23:22,659 --> 00:23:24,410
knows.

249
00:23:26,803 --> 00:23:29,897
Wh.... What are you saying?

250
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:37,259
Jeongyeon already
knows that you're her mother.

251
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:50,148
She's been patiently waiting all
this time for you to tell her.

252
00:23:53,857 --> 00:23:55,534
You silly...

253
00:23:55,621 --> 00:23:57,942
Now you cry?

254
00:23:59,816 --> 00:24:04,714
It's because she was
worried you'd react this way.

255
00:24:05,048 --> 00:24:10,268
That it would hurt you,
and make you feel sorry.

256
00:24:17,196 --> 00:24:19,432
Wipe those tears.

257
00:24:20,157 --> 00:24:24,087
Go open the door,
I'll be in my room a moment.

258
00:24:24,217 --> 00:24:27,335
Right... Go wipe your
tears and come out.

259
00:24:27,437 --> 00:24:29,330
Go.

260
00:24:33,047 --> 00:24:36,135
- Come on in.
- Dad.

261
00:24:37,085 --> 00:24:39,945
Ohh... What a nice smell!

262
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,239
Hungry, aren't you?

263
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:45,322
What is all this?

264
00:24:45,713 --> 00:24:48,083
Chop suey, ribs...

265
00:24:48,191 --> 00:24:50,551
They're all my favorites?

266
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:55,931
You're not telling me
you made all this, are you?

267
00:25:02,372 --> 00:25:04,109
Director!

268
00:25:04,638 --> 00:25:08,503
Then... Did you make all this?

269
00:25:28,907 --> 00:25:32,068
Go ahead and eat.

270
00:25:43,109 --> 00:25:46,544
Did you cut yourself cooking?

271
00:25:46,718 --> 00:25:50,686
She said she hadn't seen a
chopping board in twenty years.

272
00:25:50,846 --> 00:25:53,405
And she calls herself a woman?

273
00:25:56,168 --> 00:25:58,996
But, what is this feast...

274
00:25:59,286 --> 00:26:01,084
Today...

275
00:26:02,084 --> 00:26:06,079
is the birthday of someone I love
more than anyone else in the world.

276
00:26:10,328 --> 00:26:13,113
It's your birthday, Jeongyeon.

277
00:26:16,859 --> 00:26:21,176
Have some of that seaweed soup.

278
00:26:47,073 --> 00:26:49,465
Excuse me just a moment.

279
00:26:49,639 --> 00:26:52,018
Don't go, Jeongyeon.

280
00:27:05,021 --> 00:27:07,284
If you want to cry,

281
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,736
now you don't need to
hide it anymore, Jeongyeon.

282
00:27:17,378 --> 00:27:19,365
Here...

283
00:27:20,481 --> 00:27:23,222
Do it here in your mother's embrace.

284
00:27:25,426 --> 00:27:27,580
I will, too.

285
00:27:27,962 --> 00:27:30,162
I won't hide it any longer.

286
00:27:31,648 --> 00:27:36,151
I'll cry right in front of you, Jeongyeon.

287
00:27:42,681 --> 00:27:44,523
Mom...

288
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:50,672
Right.

289
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:53,659
That's right, my daughter.

290
00:27:53,775 --> 00:27:56,531
My daughter, Jeongyeon.

291
00:28:00,989 --> 00:28:03,445
Mom...

292
00:28:05,737 --> 00:28:07,419
I'm sorry.

293
00:28:08,272 --> 00:28:10,392
Mom is sorry.

294
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:14,539
Jeongyeon... Forgive me.

295
00:28:14,768 --> 00:28:16,911
I'm sorry, Jeongyeon.

296
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:20,231
Jeongyeon...

297
00:28:30,316 --> 00:28:32,620
Jeongyeon...

298
00:28:47,913 --> 00:28:50,891
Hi, we're looking for a missing person.

299
00:28:51,572 --> 00:28:52,530
How are you?

300
00:28:52,643 --> 00:28:55,633
We're looking for this man,
please call us if you find him.

301
00:28:55,749 --> 00:28:56,880
Give us a call.

302
00:28:56,982 --> 00:28:58,551
Hi.

303
00:28:59,663 --> 00:29:03,478
Hi, we're looking for someone.

304
00:29:16,985 --> 00:29:18,131
Thank you.

305
00:29:19,827 --> 00:29:21,373
His name is Lee Seongmo.

306
00:29:21,489 --> 00:29:25,245
He's an ANSP alumni, so pay
special attention not to be spotted,

307
00:29:25,404 --> 00:29:27,420
- and try to find him as soon as possible.
- Yes.

308
00:29:27,522 --> 00:29:32,432
I'll pay you up-front. There is more where
that comes from if you find him.

309
00:29:33,395 --> 00:29:34,798
They'll do what?!

310
00:29:34,892 --> 00:29:38,607
Are you telling me Jo
Pilyeon will be released?

311
00:29:40,608 --> 00:29:43,726
The prosecutors cited lack of evidence.

312
00:29:43,828 --> 00:29:46,424
Didn't I tell you I would testify in court?

313
00:29:49,861 --> 00:29:53,126
What it means is that
you alone won't cut it.

314
00:29:53,231 --> 00:29:59,320
Jo Pilyeon's lawyer will waste no time and
bring up your rivalry with Manbo Construction.

315
00:29:59,598 --> 00:30:03,366
- And politically speaking...
- Is there really no way?

316
00:30:04,526 --> 00:30:07,823
Is there no way to have
them imprison Jo Pilyeon?

317
00:30:09,872 --> 00:30:14,934
The government is
preparing a major announcement.

318
00:30:15,093 --> 00:30:19,690
So timing is not on your side.

319
00:30:24,132 --> 00:30:29,810
- June 29, 1987. Noh Taewoo, presidential
candidate of the Democratic Justice Party, -

320
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:35,274
- announces sweeping reforms
including direct presidential elections, -

321
00:30:36,637 --> 00:30:43,663
- which would pave the way for him becoming
the first democratically elected Korean president. -

322
00:30:51,025 --> 00:30:53,042
It's done!

323
00:30:53,869 --> 00:30:55,131
Great job, everyone.

324
00:30:55,218 --> 00:30:58,428
Our people did it!

325
00:30:58,530 --> 00:30:59,734
Congressman.

326
00:30:59,893 --> 00:31:03,049
I feel really proud of you.

327
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:06,869
Good job.

328
00:31:07,869 --> 00:31:10,101
So you're saying that
you heard Congressman Jo...

329
00:31:10,194 --> 00:31:12,677
confess that he instigated the
murder of Congressman Oh Byeongtak?

330
00:31:12,769 --> 00:31:13,676
Yes, that's correct.

331
00:31:13,782 --> 00:31:15,358
Then, is it true that you recorded it as well?

332
00:31:15,484 --> 00:31:17,646
I said I shot it firsthand!

333
00:31:17,748 --> 00:31:20,228
That tape will soon be revealed.

334
00:31:22,113 --> 00:31:24,143
It's Jo Pilyeon!

335
00:31:27,354 --> 00:31:29,817
Congressman Jo, who is
really telling the truth here?

336
00:31:29,921 --> 00:31:34,449
Lee Gangmo is still claiming that
you instigated Congressman Oh's murder.

337
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:39,562
The officers investigating this case
already proclaimed that a false testimony.

338
00:31:39,659 --> 00:31:44,070
How much longer will you let a
psychopath mislead you with his delusions?

339
00:31:44,181 --> 00:31:48,815
So if what President Lee said is a
lie, will you sue him for defamation?

340
00:31:48,975 --> 00:31:51,699
That would create too much
clamor, and I can't stand that.

341
00:31:51,815 --> 00:31:53,441
Tell him he can yap all he wants.

342
00:31:53,514 --> 00:31:55,762
I couldn't care less.

343
00:31:55,896 --> 00:31:58,343
I will sue you instead.

344
00:32:02,869 --> 00:32:08,303
You called me a lying psychopath
ring in front of these journalists,

345
00:32:08,419 --> 00:32:09,373
so it's an obvious case of defamation.

346
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,563
I have no time to waste playing with you.

347
00:32:11,693 --> 00:32:17,219
Congressman Jo and I will
soon have a long and fierce fight in court.

348
00:32:17,331 --> 00:32:21,344
Plenty of headlines like the one
you've read are waiting to be published.

349
00:32:22,388 --> 00:32:25,086
I hope you'll cover this extensively.

350
00:32:29,958 --> 00:32:36,870
You were the one saying that your
political career is more important than your own life?

351
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,407
And?

352
00:32:38,523 --> 00:32:43,323
Your political career
is about to slowly crumble.

353
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:17,573
Oppa...

354
00:33:18,259 --> 00:33:20,343
Have you ever been here?

355
00:33:20,771 --> 00:33:22,547
No.

356
00:33:23,765 --> 00:33:26,230
I've never seen this place before.

357
00:33:27,792 --> 00:33:33,916
So Big Oppa was living
in a place like this?

358
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:46,495
It's all the money
I saved over the years.

359
00:33:46,582 --> 00:33:48,394
You use it.

360
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:57,015
You'll have to find yourself
a place to live as well.

361
00:33:57,276 --> 00:34:00,017
Use this to get started.

362
00:34:01,946 --> 00:34:03,624
Thanks, Hyung.

363
00:34:04,246 --> 00:34:06,595
Thanks for what?

364
00:34:07,291 --> 00:34:12,584
You can't avenge our father
all by yourself.

365
00:34:13,556 --> 00:34:16,529
While you take care of Hwang Taeseop,

366
00:34:17,109 --> 00:34:20,346
I will bring forth
Jo Pilyeon's destruction.

367
00:34:22,391 --> 00:34:25,451
If you need anything,
don't hesitate to ask me.

368
00:34:27,698 --> 00:34:30,222
If you and I join forces,

369
00:34:30,726 --> 00:34:33,543
there is nothing
that can scare us off.

370
00:34:52,441 --> 00:34:55,898
What if Big Oppa died?

371
00:34:57,058 --> 00:34:59,857
What if he died...

372
00:35:00,923 --> 00:35:03,642
Seongmo Oppa...

373
00:35:20,163 --> 00:35:22,513
He's not dead.

374
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:25,524
I'll find him at all cost, Miju.

375

- President Lee Gangmo Keeps Accusing
Congressman Jo Pilyeon of Murder -

376
00:35:39,191 --> 00:35:42,970
Hey... If this is really true, things
are more serious than I thought.

377
00:36:17,803 --> 00:36:20,907
I see you and the
president had a long talk.

378
00:36:21,392 --> 00:36:24,344
Afraid going in will be useless.

379
00:36:24,757 --> 00:36:25,865
What?!

380
00:36:26,027 --> 00:36:28,347
He's quite upset.

381
00:36:28,706 --> 00:36:32,149
He said he doesn't
want to see you again.

382
00:36:33,396 --> 00:36:34,948
There is no way.

383
00:36:35,101 --> 00:36:37,167
The president would never abandon me.

384
00:36:37,341 --> 00:36:39,183
Look, Congressman Jo.

385
00:36:41,387 --> 00:36:45,212
Party administration will soon
file an official request,

386
00:36:45,322 --> 00:36:46,863
but you'll have to
leave the party on your own.

387
00:36:46,965 --> 00:36:48,995
Hey... Min Honggi!

388
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,232
And who would dare kick me out?

389
00:36:51,325 --> 00:36:53,229
None other than the president.

390
00:36:54,352 --> 00:36:56,579
He also said this.

391
00:36:57,206 --> 00:37:01,851
That the ruling party is not going
to recommend you for a seat in congress.

392
00:37:12,176 --> 00:37:14,903
Out of the way!
I must meet the president.

393
00:37:15,106 --> 00:37:17,284
Let's not act this way, Sir.
I must ask you to leave.

394
00:37:17,392 --> 00:37:19,407
Do you even know who I am?

395
00:37:19,514 --> 00:37:22,418
I'm Jo Pilyeon... Jo Pilyeon!!

396
00:37:23,274 --> 00:37:25,464
Do you have a death wish?

397
00:37:26,276 --> 00:37:27,720
Sir!

398
00:37:27,817 --> 00:37:30,453
Are you really going
to abandon me this way?

399
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:32,758
I worked for you like a dog!

400
00:37:32,874 --> 00:37:34,686
I devoted my entire life!

401
00:37:34,758 --> 00:37:37,601
One more chance...
Give me just one more chance!

402
00:37:37,688 --> 00:37:39,144
Sir!!

403
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,844

{\a6}- Manbo Plaza Project -
Asia's Biggest Multi-complex Building

421
00:40:33,984 --> 00:40:37,029
The Manbo Plaza we're
about to build in Gangnam...

422
00:40:37,217 --> 00:40:41,786
will become the kind of multi-complex building
that Asia has never seen before.

423
00:40:42,003 --> 00:40:45,276
The moment it is completed, I
am confident that it will become...

424
00:40:45,397 --> 00:40:48,103
a mecca of culture and
leisure symbolizing Gangnam.

425
00:40:48,219 --> 00:40:50,394
Not only is the real estate
market suffering from stagnation,

426
00:40:50,467 --> 00:40:52,511
but the entire construction
sector is facing a huge crisis,

427
00:40:52,627 --> 00:40:54,556
so some argue that your
timing could have been better.

428
00:40:54,629 --> 00:40:57,616
Being even more aggressive
in a time of crisis is my business style.

429
00:40:57,776 --> 00:40:59,702
So not only we will build this Manbo Plaza,

430
00:40:59,812 --> 00:41:04,277
but also embark on a project to build
a huge residential area in Hanoi, Vietnam.

431
00:41:04,364 --> 00:41:07,076
Are you aware of the fact that your
biggest rival Hangang Construction...

432
00:41:07,149 --> 00:41:10,484
has entered the bidding for
those Hanoi concessions?

433
00:41:10,586 --> 00:41:14,406
I personally know Chairman Lee Gangmo.

434
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:18,113
He might have experienced great
success with the New City project as of late,

435
00:41:18,237 --> 00:41:20,588
but I have no plans to
concede a second time.

436
00:41:25,712 --> 00:41:27,201
You're here.

437
00:41:27,302 --> 00:41:29,260
Give us a few comments
on your recent trip to Vietnam.

438
00:41:29,332 --> 00:41:32,699
Is it true that it's a project
worth 5 billion dollars in total?

439
00:41:32,796 --> 00:41:34,785
We will make an official announcement later.

440
00:41:34,858 --> 00:41:38,011
We just returned, so
please let us pass. Excuse me.

441
00:41:38,084 --> 00:41:39,984
Are you aware of the fact that
Jo Minwoo's Manbo Construction...

442
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:41,912
will join the bid for this Vietnam project?

443
00:41:41,985 --> 00:41:45,436
It feels as if the battle
between your two companies...

444
00:41:45,567 --> 00:41:47,193
will now move abroad...

445
00:41:47,285 --> 00:41:49,657
To cope with the current crisis the sector is facing,

446
00:41:49,758 --> 00:41:53,312
it's only natural that Manbo Construction
would set its sights on the overseas market.

447
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:57,169
I expect a fair fight, but one
with no concessions or compromises.

448
00:42:13,991 --> 00:42:15,147
Any news of my brother?

449
00:42:15,272 --> 00:42:18,765
We get a few calls
from time to time,

450
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:21,534
but they never match.

451
00:42:23,173 --> 00:42:26,709
It's been five years, Gangmo.

452
00:42:27,188 --> 00:42:31,031
I think finding your
brother might be difficult now.

453
00:42:31,161 --> 00:42:33,162
Keep looking for him.

454
00:42:33,922 --> 00:42:38,775
Until his conditions are
confirmed, we can't stop searching.

00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:53,875
It's me, Gangmo.

458
00:42:53,973 --> 00:42:56,289
Can we meet now?

459
00:42:59,449 --> 00:43:04,133
Jo Pilyeon's recent
behavior is a little suspicious.

460
00:43:05,018 --> 00:43:10,441
He kept quiet for a while
after losing the elections,

461
00:43:10,688 --> 00:43:14,110
but these days he's meeting
with Blue House officials.

462
00:43:14,218 --> 00:43:16,084
What kind of officials, exactly?

463
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:19,506
According to my sources,
we're dealing with key personnel,

464
00:43:19,602 --> 00:43:22,375
from presidential guards to secretaries.

465
00:43:22,454 --> 00:43:23,534
And his purpose?

466
00:43:23,629 --> 00:43:27,655
We're approaching
the final cabinet reshuffle.

467
00:43:27,758 --> 00:43:31,626
Considering his reputation,
what could he possibly aim for?

468
00:43:31,742 --> 00:43:34,185
So he's trying to become minister?

469
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:35,544
No.

470
00:43:35,653 --> 00:43:37,497
A little higher than that.

471
00:43:38,164 --> 00:43:40,513
Prime minister?!

472
00:43:42,935 --> 00:43:46,464
Here.... Let me pour
you a drink, Chief Kim.

473
00:43:48,683 --> 00:43:50,209
So...

474
00:43:50,629 --> 00:43:54,269
Have you decided where you'll go
after the president will be out of office?

475
00:43:54,414 --> 00:43:59,477
People like us will never be
able to leave the president's side.

476
00:43:59,583 --> 00:44:02,929
I bet...
And so it should be.

477
00:44:03,062 --> 00:44:05,782
Tell me, what can I help you with?

478
00:44:05,884 --> 00:44:09,991
Aren't you giving
us enough help as it is?

479
00:44:11,494 --> 00:44:18,820
It's just that, like you, I want to be
by his side even after he leaves office.

480
00:44:18,926 --> 00:44:20,688
I know.

481
00:44:20,941 --> 00:44:23,124
This is the last time.

482
00:44:23,284 --> 00:44:26,508
So why don't you put
in a good word for me?

483
00:44:26,617 --> 00:44:28,185
Now that you mention it,

484
00:44:28,316 --> 00:44:33,402
I did talk about that with
Chief Park of the presidential guards.

485
00:44:33,501 --> 00:44:38,053
He holds you in great esteem as well.

486
00:44:38,213 --> 00:44:41,635
When it comes to political
lobbying, he's second to none.

487
00:44:41,751 --> 00:44:48,124
He's building close relations with
most of the president's closest confidants.

488
00:44:58,035 --> 00:45:01,652
Of course, his lobbying
methods haven't changed one bit.

489
00:45:01,797 --> 00:45:06,348
Better yet, maybe I should say
he's becoming even more aggressive?

490
00:45:07,998 --> 00:45:13,327
We can't allow Jo Pilyeon
to gain that position.

491
00:45:14,617 --> 00:45:19,230
How can you stop it,
when it's nominated by the president?

492
00:45:20,222 --> 00:45:28,300
If only we had that secret
fund account, we could try something...

493
00:45:29,025 --> 00:45:31,345
I will find my brother.

494
00:45:31,838 --> 00:45:36,493
If we find him, not only
will we get that account,

495
00:45:36,733 --> 00:45:40,017
but we'll also secure
evidence of Jo Pilyeon's murders.

496
00:45:40,264 --> 00:45:44,976
It certainly would be great, but...

497
00:45:53,815 --> 00:45:56,556
- Chairman of the Korean Policy Development Jo Pilyeon -
Internally Selected as Next Prime Minister

498
00:45:58,636 --> 00:46:02,066
J... Jae.... Jaechun!

499
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:03,627
Jaechun!

500
00:46:03,722 --> 00:46:05,221
Hurry up and come here.

501
00:46:05,533 --> 00:46:07,572
I finally did it!

502
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:09,933
Jo Pilyeon did it!

503
00:46:10,022 --> 00:46:11,493
Jaechun!

504
00:46:11,597 --> 00:46:13,440
Jaechun!

505
00:46:16,184 --> 00:46:19,487
S... Seongmo, you!

506
00:46:21,301 --> 00:46:25,419
So you... you were alive?

507
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:32,624
And you thought that
after killing all those people,

508
00:46:32,885 --> 00:46:35,263
I'd let you gain that position so easily?

509
00:46:35,365 --> 00:46:37,438
S... Seongmo...

510
00:46:37,554 --> 00:46:42,978
It's really too bad,
but this is where it ends for you.

511
00:46:44,225 --> 00:46:47,071
Please don't kill me, Seongmo.

512
00:46:47,525 --> 00:46:51,404
It would be too unfair to die this way.

513
00:46:51,491 --> 00:46:53,312
Seongmo...

514
00:46:53,426 --> 00:46:54,903
S... Seongmo...

515
00:46:54,999 --> 00:46:56,558
I... I beg you...

516
00:46:56,656 --> 00:46:58,211
Please, Seongmo!

517
00:46:58,335 --> 00:47:00,132
Die!!

518
00:47:07,368 --> 00:47:10,297
Congressman!
Are you all right?

519
00:47:14,467 --> 00:47:17,045
I guess you had a nightmare.

520
00:47:17,570 --> 00:47:19,772
That Lee Seongmo...

521
00:47:20,612 --> 00:47:22,353
I'm sure he's alive.

522
00:47:22,541 --> 00:47:25,224
We've lost his traces five years ago.

523
00:47:25,369 --> 00:47:29,275
If he was still alive,
why wouldn't he show up?

524
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:30,730
No...

525
00:47:30,846 --> 00:47:33,389
I have no doubts, he's alive.

526
00:47:33,867 --> 00:47:38,087
He will take the account and that videotape,

527
00:47:38,334 --> 00:47:41,102
and come strangle me with that.

528
00:47:41,197 --> 00:47:42,898
Congressman...

529
00:47:43,429 --> 00:47:47,143
On that day, Ji Yeonsoo
disappeared along with him.

530
00:47:47,268 --> 00:47:51,034
How are you going to explain
the fact that we couldn't find her either?

531
00:47:51,586 --> 00:47:53,238
Find him.

532
00:47:53,485 --> 00:47:59,338
Before Lee Gangmo beats us to it,
we must find him at all cost.

533
00:47:59,484 --> 00:48:01,402
All right, Congressman.

534
00:48:01,509 --> 00:48:07,871
Even if it's the very
last thing I do, I will find him.

535
00:48:32,802 --> 00:48:34,192
Ajeosshi.

536
00:48:34,299 --> 00:48:36,285
I'm back.

537
00:48:39,954 --> 00:48:41,738
Ajeosshi!

538
00:49:03,034 --> 00:49:04,944
It's all right.

539
00:49:05,779 --> 00:49:08,483
You were hurting, right?

540
00:49:10,528 --> 00:49:13,911
How painful was it, if you even cried?

541
00:49:20,070 --> 00:49:22,496
It's me, Yeonsoo.

542
00:49:22,786 --> 00:49:24,531
Ajeosshi.

543
00:49:24,644 --> 00:49:27,832
Will you recognize me
today, for a change?

544
00:49:32,632 --> 00:49:35,956
Do you recognize me? Do you?

545
00:49:36,075 --> 00:49:39,081
I'm Yeonsoo...
Ji Yeonsoo.

546
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:41,764
Your lackey.

547
00:49:44,925 --> 00:49:47,114
Yes... Say it.

548
00:49:47,221 --> 00:49:50,943
Yeonsoo. Ji Yeonsoo.

549
00:49:51,364 --> 00:49:52,790
Mi...

550
00:49:52,921 --> 00:49:58,098
Mi... Ju.
Miju.

551
00:49:59,047 --> 00:50:01,724
Again with that Miju?

552
00:50:02,188 --> 00:50:06,292
I told you it's not Miju, I'm Yeonsoo.

553
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,365
Let's take off the bulletproof vest today.

554
00:50:12,525 --> 00:50:15,860
I'll give you a bath with warm water.

555
00:50:22,558 --> 00:50:24,764
Ajeosshi...

556
00:50:41,882 --> 00:50:45,149
So you're telling me
he's gradually getting worse?

557
00:50:45,294 --> 00:50:48,861
As you can see, by hitting
the right side of his cranial bone,

558
00:50:49,006 --> 00:50:52,535
it penetrated five centimeters
deep down his left cerebrum.

559
00:50:52,631 --> 00:50:54,919
It's a critical position.

560
00:50:55,028 --> 00:50:58,828
Wouldn't surgery help him recover?

561
00:50:58,952 --> 00:51:05,582
In his conditions, a surgery
could be even more dangerous.

562
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:26,745
Aigoo... How pretty.

563
00:51:32,597 --> 00:51:34,909
How come you're doing
everything I tell you today?

564
00:51:35,025 --> 00:51:38,013
You even took off the vest.

565
00:51:43,901 --> 00:51:49,404
These two nasty
little rascals are hiding inside your head,

566
00:51:49,578 --> 00:51:55,901
and they're the reason why your
head always hurts, and you can't talk.

567
00:51:59,512 --> 00:52:05,586
But, you know? I'm going to
live with you for a long time.

568
00:52:06,253 --> 00:52:12,721
And I'll help you get better on my own.

569
00:52:15,984 --> 00:52:18,525
And that's because...

570
00:52:20,277 --> 00:52:24,529
Because I like you, and...

571
00:52:28,865 --> 00:52:31,867
I'm sorry, Ajeosshi...

572
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:35,484
I'm sorry...

573
00:52:37,935 --> 00:52:40,661
I'm sorry...

574
00:52:46,810 --> 00:52:49,069
I'm sorry...

575
00:52:50,650 --> 00:52:53,550
I'm sorry...

576
00:52:59,858 --> 00:53:04,441
Right as you asked, we've restructured
the top floor into a movie theater.

577
00:53:04,938 --> 00:53:07,469
Let's put restaurants right under the theater.

578
00:53:07,583 --> 00:53:09,303
Yes, Chairman.

579
00:53:09,845 --> 00:53:11,478
Minwoo.

580
00:53:11,667 --> 00:53:13,178
Are you busy?

581
00:53:13,275 --> 00:53:14,770
Sir.

582
00:53:15,158 --> 00:53:18,903
I came to have a word with you.

583
00:53:21,388 --> 00:53:23,679
How much more do you need?

584
00:53:25,068 --> 00:53:28,566
I see you read my mind right away.

585
00:53:31,191 --> 00:53:33,552
The cabinet reshuffle
will soon be announced.

586
00:53:33,685 --> 00:53:36,234
I'll have to wedge
the door open this time.

587
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:38,464
Is that even possible?

588
00:53:39,073 --> 00:53:42,742
If we just end up throwing money at the
wall like during the last elections...

589
00:53:43,873 --> 00:53:45,221
Look, Jaechun.

590
00:53:45,352 --> 00:53:48,079
He's finally become a real businessman.

591
00:53:48,185 --> 00:53:52,009
He's trying to bargain even with his father.

592
00:53:53,212 --> 00:53:54,958
You'll have to succeed this time.

593
00:53:55,094 --> 00:53:58,851
Or else I will refuse to meet you again.

594
00:53:59,042 --> 00:54:02,868
Hand me five big ones.

595
00:54:04,014 --> 00:54:05,314
Fine.

596
00:54:05,425 --> 00:54:07,915
- Chairman...
- There is no time.

597
00:54:08,031 --> 00:54:10,230
Don't make me wait.

598
00:54:16,031 --> 00:54:17,340
Chairman.

599
00:54:17,547 --> 00:54:19,951
We already have given him
a very significant sum.

600
00:54:20,052 --> 00:54:21,401
With the current financial woes we're facing,

601
00:54:21,459 --> 00:54:23,170
just completing Manbo Plaza will be...

602
00:54:23,257 --> 00:54:27,702
When my father becomes prime
minister, everything will be solved.

603
00:54:27,797 --> 00:54:28,575
What?

604
00:54:28,684 --> 00:54:33,959
He'll be able to affect the Hanoi concessions
and the Manbo Plaza construction as well.

605
00:54:34,371 --> 00:54:38,737
I'm telling you that whatever Lee
Gangmo tries, they all will be ours.

606
00:54:38,838 --> 00:54:42,492
But you should be realistic
about our financial situation.

607
00:54:42,623 --> 00:54:44,711
Just think of it as an investment.

608
00:54:45,103 --> 00:54:46,451
It will make it easier to accept it.

609
00:54:46,596 --> 00:54:51,023
Then, how do you
plan to gather those funds?

610
00:54:51,364 --> 00:54:53,600
Would it be difficult to get
another loan from the bank?

611
00:54:53,705 --> 00:54:57,052
I think that route is pretty
much out of the question now.

612
00:55:10,001 --> 00:55:11,596
Yes?

613
00:55:16,568 --> 00:55:19,773
Chairman Jo Minwoo of
Manbo Construction is here.

614
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:21,208
Escort him in.

615
00:55:21,317 --> 00:55:22,949
Yes, Chairman.

616
00:55:33,818 --> 00:55:36,377
Have a seat, Chairman Jo.

617
00:55:42,018 --> 00:55:44,231
This is awkward, I'll
just drop the formalities.

618
00:55:44,347 --> 00:55:45,363
Fine with me.

619
00:55:45,473 --> 00:55:47,346
I wondered if you could
lend us some money.

620
00:55:47,476 --> 00:55:51,972
So a huge corporation like yours
comes knocking at our doors?! What a honor.

621
00:55:52,088 --> 00:55:53,993
I'd like to start with five billion.

622
00:55:54,112 --> 00:55:55,960
We might need more down the line.

623
00:55:56,193 --> 00:55:59,856
Our biggest strength is quick loans.

624
00:56:00,876 --> 00:56:05,308
But I'm sure you know that our
interest rates are higher than commercial banks?

625
00:56:17,687 --> 00:56:19,403
Five billion?!

626
00:56:21,439 --> 00:56:22,933
I looked into it,

627
00:56:23,063 --> 00:56:27,501
and seems they have outstanding loans
with their main bank for over 10 billion.

628
00:56:28,136 --> 00:56:31,054
I'm sure it's not money
they need for Manbo Plaza.

629
00:56:31,289 --> 00:56:35,005
Then, where would
he spend all that money?

630
00:56:35,147 --> 00:56:36,932
Lobby.

631
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:41,079
Is there really a chance
he will become prime minister?

632
00:56:41,584 --> 00:56:43,675
It's more than likely.

633
00:56:44,454 --> 00:56:48,326
There's only one
year left until the elections...

634
00:56:48,448 --> 00:56:51,158
That's why Jo Pilyeon's lobbying works.

635
00:56:51,881 --> 00:56:53,494
It's just political spin, anyway.

636
00:56:53,610 --> 00:56:56,032
And if his father obtains that post,

637
00:56:56,249 --> 00:56:59,715
it'll be like giving
wings to Jo Minwoo?

638
00:57:01,803 --> 00:57:05,578
Wouldn't this influence
your business as well?

639
00:57:05,670 --> 00:57:11,219
Why do you think Jo Minwoo
is so eager to help his father?

640
00:57:12,553 --> 00:57:15,540
So he can conspire with him to
gain benefits at his rivals' expense.

641
00:57:15,772 --> 00:57:17,977
And I'll be the target of their little complot.

642
00:57:21,627 --> 00:57:24,407
But if we find my brother,
we can bring an end to all this.

643
00:57:25,059 --> 00:57:27,728
We must find him.

644
00:57:45,293 --> 00:57:46,571
Allow me to introduce myself.

645
00:57:46,679 --> 00:57:48,112
I'm Jo Minwoo.

646
00:57:48,192 --> 00:57:49,776
Have a seat.

647
00:57:51,081 --> 00:57:55,504
Your father seems really proud of you.

648
00:57:55,741 --> 00:57:58,755
I've heard the upcoming cabinet
reshuffle is keeping him on his toes.

649
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:03,638
Seems like I'll have to take good care
of you on his behalf until then.

650
00:58:03,749 --> 00:58:06,717
You can never be too careful.

651
00:58:12,474 --> 00:58:16,460
It's a secret Swiss bank account.

652
00:58:24,190 --> 00:58:29,473
So how many trips are you going to
make, when it could just take one?

653
00:58:29,662 --> 00:58:30,648
Excuse me?

654
00:58:30,778 --> 00:58:34,650
You and your father
are quite different, after all.

655
00:58:35,564 --> 00:58:37,870
We're a little lacking here.

656
00:58:49,848 --> 00:58:52,750
We're a little lacking,
so give me some more?

657
00:58:52,856 --> 00:58:55,794
I think that it's
what he was suggesting.

658
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:57,998
Shameless piece of shit...

659
00:58:58,114 --> 00:58:59,913
How would you like to proceed?

660
00:59:00,072 --> 00:59:01,638
What do you think?

661
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:03,251
Are you going to stop now?

662
00:59:03,359 --> 00:59:08,626
- But the money for Manbo Plaza's...
- Enough with that damned Manbo Plaza, please.

663
00:59:08,743 --> 00:59:10,538
I apologize.

664
00:59:15,817 --> 00:59:17,862
Wow... Who is this?

665
00:59:18,126 --> 00:59:20,482
Minwoo, long time no see.

666
00:59:20,614 --> 00:59:23,513
Where have you been all this time?

667
00:59:24,688 --> 00:59:28,226
Be it you knocking at my
door or the other way around,

668
00:59:28,357 --> 00:59:30,546
we'll soon get to meet.

669
00:59:31,475 --> 00:59:35,428
I'm a bit late, so I'll get going.

670
01:00:05,196 --> 01:00:06,356
You little...

671
01:00:06,486 --> 01:00:10,860
I don't see you in a few years,
and look at what I have to witness.

672
01:00:10,962 --> 01:00:13,732
I apologize for not keeping in touch, Dad.

673
01:00:13,833 --> 01:00:18,735
Well, at least you seem to have
made a decent living in the meantime.

674
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:22,404
I have a little credit business in Sokcho.

675
01:00:22,694 --> 01:00:25,263
Credit? Private lending, you mean?

676
01:00:25,348 --> 01:00:26,189
Yes.

677
01:00:26,349 --> 01:00:29,235
And where did you find the money?

678
01:00:29,394 --> 01:00:35,499
I entrusted the inheritance my
mother left me to President Noh.

679
01:00:35,775 --> 01:00:37,167
I see...

680
01:00:37,283 --> 01:00:40,355
So, have you made a little money?

681
01:00:40,469 --> 01:00:44,630
I just acquired a department store in Sokcho.

682
01:00:44,758 --> 01:00:48,007
I'm also running a
theater and a restaurant.

683
01:00:49,037 --> 01:00:51,995
You made it big?!

684
01:00:52,822 --> 01:00:55,200
And they say that every dog has its day...

685
01:00:55,316 --> 01:00:58,838
You will need a lot of financial
backing now that you joined politics, right?

686
01:00:58,968 --> 01:01:01,580
I will help you now.

687
01:01:01,742 --> 01:01:05,828
You'll help me?

688
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:11,627
You little...

689
01:01:28,794 --> 01:01:31,410
And when am I supposed to
find the time to read all these?

690
01:01:31,555 --> 01:01:35,790
Just be glad there's a line
of people wanting to cast you.

691
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:40,445
There's really nothing to my liking...

692
01:01:44,592 --> 01:01:46,942
Yes, Star Entertainment.

693
01:01:47,311 --> 01:01:49,030
And?

694
01:01:49,666 --> 01:01:50,625
Just a moment.

695
01:01:50,785 --> 01:01:52,003
Soojeong.

696
01:01:52,249 --> 01:01:54,961
- Take it.
- Who is it?

697
01:01:59,370 --> 01:02:01,054
Hello?

698
01:02:01,576 --> 01:02:05,419
You're looking for Lee Seongmo, right?

699
01:02:06,264 --> 01:02:07,986
Why?

700
01:02:08,928 --> 01:02:10,085
Sokcho?!

701
01:02:10,194 --> 01:02:12,600
This fan from Sokcho called me,

702
01:02:12,710 --> 01:02:15,312
and he said he saw Seongmo.

703
01:02:15,628 --> 01:02:17,097
Miju, let's go.

704
01:02:17,202 --> 01:02:18,853
Follow me.

705
01:02:21,928 --> 01:02:24,596
I'll be counting on you.

706
01:02:25,046 --> 01:02:28,004
We'll have to meet over a drink later.

707
01:02:35,002 --> 01:02:37,125
Who was I going to
meet this evening again?

708
01:02:37,212 --> 01:02:39,304
The Assembly speaker?

709
01:02:39,837 --> 01:02:43,781
Someone from a hospital in Sokcho
saw a man with a bullet in his head.

710
01:02:43,905 --> 01:02:46,437
- A bullet in his head?
- Yes.

711
01:02:46,638 --> 01:02:51,902
And the description
resembled Lee Seongmo.

712
01:02:55,111 --> 01:02:56,702
Hurry...

713
01:02:57,076 --> 01:02:58,805
Go down to Sokcho and check it out.

714
01:02:58,936 --> 01:02:59,942
Now.

715
01:03:00,255 --> 01:03:02,271
I'll get going.

716
01:03:12,924 --> 01:03:16,301
Wow... Nice view?!

717
01:03:16,712 --> 01:03:21,058
Once the highway to Chuncheon
is done, it will just be killer.

718
01:03:21,974 --> 01:03:23,867
Should we build here?

719
01:03:23,998 --> 01:03:27,043
If the highway is extended
to Sokcho, it would be even better.

720
01:03:27,145 --> 01:03:28,131
The East Sea is close, too.

721
01:03:28,218 --> 01:03:33,960
Nah... In a place like this,
we should just build a resort.

722
01:03:34,889 --> 01:03:39,199
Chairman... Shall we give that a try?

723
01:03:39,992 --> 01:03:42,036
Where did he see him?

724
01:03:43,061 --> 01:03:44,231
I don't know.

725
01:03:44,371 --> 01:03:47,040
We're going to meet by the terminal.

726
01:03:47,601 --> 01:03:49,867
We must find him.

727
01:03:50,489 --> 01:03:53,474
Then, it'll be all over for Jo Pilyeon.

728

734
01:04:16,884 --> 01:04:19,476
I will become prime minister.

735
01:04:19,596 --> 01:04:21,380
You said the hearing will last a day, right?

736
01:04:21,496 --> 01:04:24,440
If needed, I will join it.

737
01:04:24,570 --> 01:04:28,167
- Did they find him?
- No, but there are rumors that Jeongshik did.

738
01:04:28,283 --> 01:04:31,038
You want me to extend
my hands to Hwang Taeseop?!

739
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:32,590
Once I become prime minister,

740
01:04:32,691 --> 01:04:38,019
him and Lee Gangmo
will be the first I trample on.
