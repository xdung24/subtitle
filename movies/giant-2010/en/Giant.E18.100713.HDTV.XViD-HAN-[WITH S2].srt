5
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:37,326
Gangmo.

6
00:00:37,434 --> 00:00:39,238
Lee Gangmo!

7
00:00:59,905 --> 00:01:06,253
Is this the tallest building in Seoul?

8
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,194
I thought you had died.

9
00:01:13,877 --> 00:01:15,753
How foolish of me.

10
00:01:17,024 --> 00:01:20,905
My brother was right in front of me,
and I didn't even recognize him.

11
00:01:22,742 --> 00:01:24,425
Hyung...

12
00:01:29,325 --> 00:01:31,280
Seongmo Hyung!

13
00:01:37,593 --> 00:01:40,846
I'm your wretched brother.

14
00:01:45,948 --> 00:01:47,312
Hyung!

15
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:50,564
Hyung... Hyung!

16
00:01:54,821 --> 00:01:56,937
Hyung!

17
00:02:04,533 --> 00:02:07,154
<i>Hyung...</i>

18
00:02:10,702 --> 00:02:14,742
Hyung, you haven't 
seen Miju yet, right?

19
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:19,825
I met her.

20
00:02:23,085 --> 00:02:25,369
Hyung, I'm sorry.

21
00:02:26,865 --> 00:02:29,592
Mom passed away.

22
00:02:30,915 --> 00:02:32,827
Don't talk about it, Gangmo.

23
00:02:32,947 --> 00:02:37,962
And our youngest, Junmo,
was adopted overseas.

24
00:02:39,465 --> 00:02:44,083
And after we all 
got separated, even Miju...

25
00:02:46,045 --> 00:02:48,965
She had to grow up in an orphanage.

26
00:02:51,442 --> 00:02:53,302
I know...

27
00:02:54,561 --> 00:02:57,330
And that's why it's so painful to bear.

28
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,914
I was so foolish...

29
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:05,804
The fact I couldn't protect
my family makes me so angry...

30
00:03:05,972 --> 00:03:07,872
It's so painful to bear, Gangmo.

31
00:03:08,029 --> 00:03:09,616
Hyung...

32
00:03:10,362 --> 00:03:13,257
Hyung! Hyung...

33
00:03:25,645 --> 00:03:28,135
<i>Hyung!</i>

34
00:03:41,697 --> 00:03:45,060
<i>How did you end up
working for Chairman Hwang?</i>

35
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:49,867
He's like a father to me.

36
00:03:51,214 --> 00:03:57,094
In my darkest hour,
right when I lost Miju,

37
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,847
he took me under his wings.

38
00:04:01,736 --> 00:04:02,674
Gangmo.

39
00:04:02,794 --> 00:04:05,812
He's an orphan just like me.

40
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:09,853
And just like him,

41
00:04:11,717 --> 00:04:13,595
one day I will succeed.

42
00:04:16,732 --> 00:04:19,874
So how did you enter the KCIA?

43
00:04:20,476 --> 00:04:24,227
Must be really difficult
to be accepted there?!

44
00:04:25,301 --> 00:04:28,122
<i>Seems like Director Jo Pilyeon
has full confidence in you,</i>

45
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:31,489
so were you helped by him?

46
00:04:32,703 --> 00:04:34,724
Let's talk about that another day.

47
00:04:41,957 --> 00:04:44,610
<i>Inside you'll find a forged ID,</i>

48
00:04:45,296 --> 00:04:48,639
and I added a few things 
you might need.

49
00:04:53,556 --> 00:04:55,985
<i>Here's where you'll be hiding.</i>

50
00:04:56,442 --> 00:04:58,847
For the time being, stay there.

51
00:05:01,325 --> 00:05:04,198
I don't want to spend
the rest of my life hiding.

52
00:05:11,358 --> 00:05:14,613
I'll never let that happen.

53
00:05:15,022 --> 00:05:18,100
I'll soon send you overseas.

54
00:05:20,671 --> 00:05:23,881
Trust me. Got it?

55
00:05:34,773 --> 00:05:36,653
Take good care of Miju, Hyung.

56
00:05:36,809 --> 00:05:38,637
Don't you worry.

57
00:05:38,842 --> 00:05:41,126
I'm the eldest, remember?

58
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:46,996
From here on in,
I'll take care of my family.

59
00:06:03,088 --> 00:06:04,459
<i>How do you explain this?</i>

60
00:06:04,591 --> 00:06:06,003
Lee Gangmo escaped?!

61
00:06:06,063 --> 00:06:08,596
Someone helped him get out.

62
00:06:09,015 --> 00:06:10,472
Are you saying he had an accomplice?

63
00:06:10,592 --> 00:06:12,372
Seeing how he dealt 
with those detectives,

64
00:06:12,468 --> 00:06:14,635
we're likely dealing with a pro.

65
00:06:14,804 --> 00:06:18,688
There's good reason 
to suspect Director Min's side.

66
00:06:19,181 --> 00:06:22,661
Stick to his underlings day and night.

67
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:25,064
If they're hiding Lee Gangmo anywhere,

68
00:06:25,398 --> 00:06:28,621
they'll try to establish contact
before the elections.

69
00:06:28,716 --> 00:06:31,601
- Yes.
- Consider it done, Director.

70
00:06:36,234 --> 00:06:39,416
Let me ask you just one thing.

71
00:06:40,162 --> 00:06:43,480
Why didn't you tell your brother
that Jo Pilyeon and Hwang Taeseop...

72
00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:46,342
were responsible 
for your father's death?

73
00:06:47,244 --> 00:06:52,345
He still acts as if he owes
Chairman Hwang his life.

74
00:06:52,525 --> 00:06:55,207
I can keep the burden
of revenge all to myself.

75
00:06:56,133 --> 00:07:01,931
Gangmo has always been 
full of dreams.

76
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:07,520
I don't want to see that
filthy blood stain his hands.

77
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:15,300
So what you're saying is that you'll 
bear that burden all by yourself.

78
00:07:16,058 --> 00:07:17,704
Gangmo...

79
00:07:19,941 --> 00:07:23,837
has already endured enough
difficulties because of me.

80
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,276
From now on,

81
00:07:28,178 --> 00:07:30,703
I'll only live for my siblings' sake.

82
00:07:34,058 --> 00:07:36,171
I told you I know nothing!

83
00:07:36,276 --> 00:07:39,483
Young lady, isn't he your brother?

84
00:07:39,734 --> 00:07:42,283
I told you I haven't seen
him once after that day.

85
00:07:42,355 --> 00:07:44,135
We'll have to take
her down to the station.

86
00:07:44,219 --> 00:07:45,547
This won't do it.

87
00:07:45,654 --> 00:07:46,846
The station?!

88
00:07:46,918 --> 00:07:50,385
- Why would you take me...
- Detectives.

89
00:07:56,394 --> 00:07:58,310
Is she Lee Gangmo's sister?

90
00:07:58,403 --> 00:07:59,350
Yes, that's right.

91
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:01,564
And you are?

92
00:08:05,542 --> 00:08:07,419
We'll take care of investigating her.

93
00:08:07,539 --> 00:08:08,585
<i>What?</i>

94
00:08:09,538 --> 00:08:11,014
Yes... Yes, certainly.

95
00:08:11,122 --> 00:08:12,902
Let's go.

96
00:08:29,153 --> 00:08:31,297
How about Little Oppa?

97
00:08:32,392 --> 00:08:36,360
He's hiding in a safe place,
so you don't need to worry.

98
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:38,946
Big Oppa...

99
00:08:41,051 --> 00:08:42,999
Ahh... Miju.

100
00:08:44,017 --> 00:08:47,857
Detectives will start trailing you.

101
00:08:48,554 --> 00:08:52,663
Don't try looking for me 
before I get in contact first.

102
00:08:53,219 --> 00:08:55,372
All right, Oppa.

103
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:01,072
But, what will happen to
Gangmo Oppa from now on?

104
00:09:01,517 --> 00:09:04,042
First, he'll have to go overseas.

105
00:09:04,331 --> 00:09:09,193
After that, we'll catch the
culprit and prove his innocence.

106
00:09:15,674 --> 00:09:20,395
Then, when can we start
living all together again?

107
00:09:26,568 --> 00:09:28,808
Let's endure it a little longer.

108
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:31,561
There's nothing else we can do now.

109
00:09:32,247 --> 00:09:35,923
If Gangmo Oppa goes abroad, 
I'll follow him there.

110
00:09:36,092 --> 00:09:41,239
I'll cook for him, do his laundry,
and take care of him.

111
00:09:42,838 --> 00:09:44,678
Miju.

112
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:48,188
Leave Gangmo to me,

113
00:09:48,272 --> 00:09:51,591
and worry about having fun
doing what you really want.

114
00:09:51,711 --> 00:09:54,790
That's what Gangmo 
would like you to do.

115
00:09:57,171 --> 00:10:00,482
First, let's move to a nicer place.

116
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:03,500
Stop working as a bus conductor.

117
00:10:04,703 --> 00:10:09,753
From now on, I'll provide for you.

118
00:10:10,101 --> 00:10:12,074
No, Oppa.

119
00:10:12,438 --> 00:10:16,863
That would only make 
the police suspect us.

120
00:10:19,088 --> 00:10:24,042
As you say, all I need to do 
is to work hard and live happily.

121
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:27,888
Worry about Gangmo Oppa instead.

122
00:11:02,063 --> 00:11:04,312
Will you be staying for long?

123
00:11:04,727 --> 00:11:06,964
Just a few days.

124
00:11:07,168 --> 00:11:10,790
If you need anything,
feel free to call me, uh?

125
00:11:10,887 --> 00:11:12,258
Yes.

126
00:11:25,545 --> 00:11:27,421
Jeongyeon.

127
00:11:33,909 --> 00:11:36,975
When will we meet again?

128
00:11:44,345 --> 00:11:46,956
Will that day even come?

129
00:11:56,227 --> 00:12:00,053
Everything is in order,
including your heart.

130
00:12:00,427 --> 00:12:01,719
Really?

131
00:12:01,827 --> 00:12:05,627
There's nothing wrong with you,
but you feel chest pains all day long.

132
00:12:05,735 --> 00:12:10,281
What else... Insomnia, shortness
of breath, lack of appetite.

133
00:12:10,702 --> 00:12:13,684
Did you break up with your partner?

134
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,521
What?

135
00:12:15,641 --> 00:12:20,511
Those are the kind of symptoms
people who break up sometimes show.

136
00:12:22,413 --> 00:12:28,020
It must be because I'm concerned
about a friend, I suppose.

137
00:12:34,282 --> 00:12:38,121
<i>Sometimes your mind can be deceitful.</i>

138
00:12:38,229 --> 00:12:41,977
<i>But your body never lies.</i>

139
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:48,819
<i>The way I see it, I think you must be 
in love with that friend of yours?!</i>

140
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,213
<i>Hwang Jeongyeon.</i>

141
00:12:54,683 --> 00:12:56,181
Here.

142
00:12:56,398 --> 00:12:58,250
Write it from scratch.

143
00:13:08,937 --> 00:13:12,821
<i>Let's meet on Sunday at noon,
in front of the Hangang Hotel.</i>

144
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:15,558
<i>I'm asking you out on a date.</i>

145
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,860
<i>Don't worry about Gangmo.</i>

146
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,478
<i>I'm trying to help him 
one way or another.</i>

147
00:13:35,831 --> 00:13:37,320
Can't you look where you're going?

148
00:13:37,408 --> 00:13:39,823
Do you even know who I am?

149
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:51,490
Everything going well, I hope?

150
00:13:51,586 --> 00:13:53,560
What are you, out of your mind?

151
00:13:53,647 --> 00:13:54,713
How can you come here?

152
00:13:54,797 --> 00:13:58,083
Then, what else could I do?
I ran out of money.

153
00:13:58,842 --> 00:14:00,148
You really...

154
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,437
Here... In the car.

155
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:09,790
So you've already spent 
all that money I gave you?

156
00:14:09,874 --> 00:14:13,037
Think hiding is that easy?

157
00:14:13,897 --> 00:14:16,743
You could just get it over with 
and go for a big payoff.

158
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:19,087
I ought to just...

159
00:14:23,051 --> 00:14:26,169
Why, no money left to give me?

160
00:14:26,686 --> 00:14:30,728
If that's the case, someone will have
to hear a few words from me, I guess.

161
00:14:31,243 --> 00:14:35,682
Is there any position available here 
at Manbo Construction? I wonder...

162
00:14:55,011 --> 00:14:56,406
<i>You...</i>

163
00:14:56,611 --> 00:14:58,775
<i>This is the last time.</i>

164
00:14:59,136 --> 00:15:01,721
<i>Pop up before me 
without my consent again,</i>

165
00:15:01,974 --> 00:15:04,247
and they won't even find your 
dead body when I'm done with you.

166
00:15:04,427 --> 00:15:06,195
Is that clear?

167
00:15:12,082 --> 00:15:16,309
So who's blackmailing who?

168
00:15:24,372 --> 00:15:26,156
Hey... Hey...

169
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:29,331
Couldn't you add an egg yolk 
or two in this herbal tea?

170
00:15:29,451 --> 00:15:32,903
Aww... Oppa.
That's for morning coffee.

171
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:36,699
<i>Didn't seem that way to me...</i>

172
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,117
Hey... Hey!

173
00:15:38,189 --> 00:15:41,039
- Come on in...
- Come on in where...

174
00:15:41,454 --> 00:15:44,262
Park Sotae. Right?

175
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:47,076
And who do I have the pleasure
to meet, calling my name and all?

176
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,753
I'm Jeongyeon.

177
00:15:48,942 --> 00:15:50,424
Hwang Jeongyeon.

178
00:15:51,252 --> 00:15:53,310
<i>I'm sure that name should ring a bell?</i>

179
00:15:55,075 --> 00:15:57,014
Let's go together 
to the police station.

180
00:15:57,726 --> 00:15:59,022
What's wrong with you?

181
00:15:59,106 --> 00:16:03,359
You went to meet Chairman Hong 
with Jeongshik that day.

182
00:16:03,466 --> 00:16:05,597
Let's go to the station,
and confess the truth!

183
00:16:05,705 --> 00:16:09,132
Why, did... anyone witness us?

184
00:16:09,276 --> 00:16:12,944
Witness or not, 
let's go and confess everything.

185
00:16:13,052 --> 00:16:16,166
We never went there?!

186
00:16:16,293 --> 00:16:18,664
And what's with the attitude?

187
00:16:18,784 --> 00:16:21,117
- You didn't?
- That's right. We went back on the way, why?

188
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:23,234
And what are you 
meeting Jeongshik for?

189
00:16:23,486 --> 00:16:24,929
Why have you 
been hiding as of late?

190
00:16:24,977 --> 00:16:28,116
Ahh... You're driving me crazy.

191
00:16:28,284 --> 00:16:31,320
Let's go.
Go ahead, I have nothing to hide.

192
00:16:31,429 --> 00:16:33,641
Here... Let's go.

193
00:16:35,024 --> 00:16:38,050
- How much is it?
- 500 won.

194
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:41,810
What are you waiting for?
Bill is yours.

195
00:16:48,964 --> 00:16:51,093
Stop there!

196
00:17:19,156 --> 00:17:20,849
I have something to tell you.

197
00:17:20,933 --> 00:17:22,435
Is it urgent?

198
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:25,086
Yes. Very urgent.

199
00:17:25,382 --> 00:17:28,538
Head to the station alone.

200
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:32,375
Have them explain to you
what happened with Gangmo.

201
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:34,310
All right, Chairman.

202
00:17:36,629 --> 00:17:38,928
What else happened to Gangmo?

203
00:17:39,072 --> 00:17:42,848
I was told he escaped from prison.

204
00:17:43,374 --> 00:17:44,868
What?!

205
00:17:45,193 --> 00:17:47,622
<i>Here... Let's go up.</i>

206
00:17:51,542 --> 00:17:55,088
So, what was this 
urgent matter to discuss?

207
00:17:55,287 --> 00:17:58,804
I struggled long and hard 
on whether I should tell you.

208
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:02,159
But I just thought 
you had the right to know.

209
00:18:03,528 --> 00:18:05,522
Just say it.

210
00:18:06,089 --> 00:18:08,194
On the day Chairman Hong 
was murdered,

211
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:11,224
Jeongshik went to that cottage.

212
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,959
Wh...What did you just say?

213
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:18,098
Shideok gave the keys
of Gangmo's car to Jeongshik.

214
00:18:18,192 --> 00:18:21,974
And Gangmo's work uniform 
was inside the trunk.

215
00:18:22,238 --> 00:18:26,555
Jeongyeon... 
What are you trying to say?

216
00:18:26,699 --> 00:18:30,018
A man called Park Sotae
went there with Jeongshik.

217
00:18:30,122 --> 00:18:33,078
I just saw him meet with Jeongshik.

218
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:38,128
Nah... There must be
a misunderstanding of sorts.

219
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:43,400
Why would Jeongshik meet Hong Gipyo?

220
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:48,014
According to Shideok,
he was looking for an account.

221
00:18:48,733 --> 00:18:50,635
To win your praise.

222
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,547
What?!

223
00:18:54,965 --> 00:18:57,474
Dad... Are you all right?

224
00:18:57,714 --> 00:19:02,176
It's all right. I'm fine.

225
00:19:06,315 --> 00:19:07,888
Jeongyeon.

226
00:19:08,032 --> 00:19:14,114
You didn't tell this to anyone, did you?

227
00:19:14,235 --> 00:19:17,782
You're the first one I told this to.

228
00:19:19,562 --> 00:19:25,484
Gangmo would even pretend
to die if you asked him to.

229
00:19:26,278 --> 00:19:30,378
You're the only one
who can prove his innocence.

230
00:19:32,218 --> 00:19:34,347
It's not Jeongshik.

231
00:19:34,761 --> 00:19:35,735
Dad!

232
00:19:35,867 --> 00:19:39,246
Might be a wretched punk,
but he's still my son.

233
00:19:39,354 --> 00:19:41,483
Think I wouldn't know
my own flesh and blood?

234
00:19:41,663 --> 00:19:44,284
He's not the kind of man 
who can kill.

235
00:19:44,489 --> 00:19:47,170
Jeongyeon...
It wasn't Jeongshik.

236
00:19:47,267 --> 00:19:49,793
Then, how about Gangmo?

237
00:19:49,906 --> 00:19:53,091
Think he's the kind of man
who could commit murder?

238
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:59,009
I'm sure Jeongshik has that account.

239
00:19:59,202 --> 00:20:01,330
Verify that yourself.

240
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,127
There's no need.

241
00:20:03,259 --> 00:20:06,987
There is no way 
Jeongshik is responsible!

242
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,524
I believe in you.

243
00:20:10,582 --> 00:20:17,630
Believe that you're not the kind 
of coward who would ignore Gangmo.

244
00:20:20,455 --> 00:20:22,271
I do.

245
00:20:34,097 --> 00:20:35,812
Ahh... Really...

246
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:42,809
Jeongshik killed a man?!

247
00:20:43,446 --> 00:20:44,673
No way.

248
00:20:45,081 --> 00:20:48,160
Jeongshik would never do that!

249
00:20:48,292 --> 00:20:51,707
No.
He wouldn't be capable of that!

250
00:20:54,431 --> 00:20:57,104
Here... Let me pour you one.

251
00:20:57,248 --> 00:20:58,955
Yes, Dad.

252
00:20:59,088 --> 00:21:00,711
But, tell me.
What's the occasion?

253
00:21:00,807 --> 00:21:03,200
We generally don't get
to share these moments.

254
00:21:03,309 --> 00:21:07,707
Why, what's wrong with
father and son having a drink?

255
00:21:11,719 --> 00:21:13,776
Here, have one yourself.

256
00:21:13,945 --> 00:21:19,554
Fine, let's see if I still remember what
a drink poured by my son tastes like.

257
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,629
Things are hectic these days, I bet?

258
00:21:25,885 --> 00:21:29,016
I know how things 
are going in the company.

259
00:21:29,149 --> 00:21:32,023
We have the subway construction,
and with the upcoming by-elections,

260
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:34,271
there's Director Jo's campaign to fund.

261
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:37,323
Not to mention falling 
estate prices... Ehh...

262
00:21:37,455 --> 00:21:39,487
So I was wondering.

263
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,344
Jeongshik.

264
00:21:42,049 --> 00:21:43,299
Yes, Dad?

265
00:21:43,492 --> 00:21:45,512
By any chance,

266
00:21:45,945 --> 00:21:49,952
are you in possession of
Chairman Hong Gipyo's account?

267
00:21:50,968 --> 00:21:52,169
What?

268
00:21:53,022 --> 00:21:56,652
What is that supposed to mean?

269
00:21:58,222 --> 00:22:01,632
I mean... Why would I have it?

270
00:22:01,717 --> 00:22:03,316
Listen to you...

271
00:22:03,424 --> 00:22:07,111
Chairman Hong is dead, anyhow.

272
00:22:07,472 --> 00:22:11,440
And Gangmo is being 
accused of his murder.

273
00:22:13,015 --> 00:22:14,073
And?

274
00:22:14,206 --> 00:22:17,900
If you do have that account,

275
00:22:18,033 --> 00:22:20,257
give it to me.

276
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:25,308
With that in our hands, there's no
need to worry about campaign funding.

277
00:22:26,444 --> 00:22:27,701
Dad...

278
00:22:27,821 --> 00:22:31,350
What on earth are you talking about?

279
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:35,859
If you don't have it, then too bad.

280
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,829
But if you really do,

281
00:22:39,286 --> 00:22:41,775
we must make the best use of it.

282
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:46,573
Only then we can save our company.

283
00:22:49,465 --> 00:22:51,292
Jeongshik.

284
00:22:52,648 --> 00:22:55,773
Why do you think 
I would even ask you this?

285
00:23:04,022 --> 00:23:11,133
In due time, when you
find yourself in my shoes,

286
00:23:12,231 --> 00:23:15,377
you'll understand my concerns.

287
00:23:18,062 --> 00:23:23,230
I'll head home, so take
your time and enjoy the night.

288
00:23:52,276 --> 00:23:54,280
<i>Jeongshik...</i>

289
00:23:54,941 --> 00:23:56,673
<i>It's not you...</i>

290
00:23:56,925 --> 00:23:58,645
<i>Right?</i>

291
00:23:59,463 --> 00:24:02,229
<i>You didn't kill him, right?</i>

292
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,489
<i>You fool.</i>

293
00:24:04,838 --> 00:24:10,875
<i>Please... I beg you, 
don't ever bring me that account.</i>

294
00:24:11,187 --> 00:24:13,374
<i>Uh? Jeongshik.</i>

295
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:20,048
<i>{\a6}*archaic for partner, husband</i>

296
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:20,048
What's capturing 
your thoughts, Seobangnim*?

297
00:24:22,776 --> 00:24:26,158
Seeing how far Dad went with this,

298
00:24:26,483 --> 00:24:29,538
it really must be 
a golden opportunity.

299
00:24:29,682 --> 00:24:32,063
Opportunity? To do what?

300
00:24:32,195 --> 00:24:35,237
"Make a nice showing 
once and for all,"

301
00:24:35,466 --> 00:24:37,979
"and capture your place as my heir?"

302
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,301
Right... Oppa!

303
00:24:40,469 --> 00:24:45,488
Inherit the company, 
and get me out of here, will you?

304
00:24:45,732 --> 00:24:50,077
Do what? 
Aigoo... You sly fox!

305
00:24:50,246 --> 00:24:52,230
Come here!

306
00:24:56,471 --> 00:24:58,057
Smuggle me out?!

307
00:24:59,782 --> 00:25:01,593
What's the destination?

308
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:05,597
I'm looking into it, so hang in there.

309
00:25:05,994 --> 00:25:10,036
The moment I get you a spot there,
you'll be able to go abroad.

310
00:25:10,601 --> 00:25:12,597
<i>Miju is doing okay, I hope?</i>

311
00:25:13,439 --> 00:25:15,086
Yeah.

312
00:25:15,664 --> 00:25:18,153
Strong and cheerful as always.

313
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,774
But I worry about you as well.

314
00:25:20,931 --> 00:25:22,915
I fear something might
happen to you because of me.

315
00:25:23,011 --> 00:25:27,989
If anything happens to you,
I don't think I want to go on anymore.

316
00:25:28,146 --> 00:25:30,587
Don't even joke about that, Hyung.

317
00:25:30,707 --> 00:25:36,567
So you must keep yourself 
out of trouble.

318
00:25:36,904 --> 00:25:38,822
If you don't, I...

319
00:25:40,932 --> 00:25:43,963
I will never be able to face
our parents in the afterlife.

320
00:25:44,299 --> 00:25:46,283
I'm sorry, Hyung.

321
00:25:46,547 --> 00:25:48,447
I've put you through so much trouble...

322
00:25:48,844 --> 00:25:53,498
What happened to you is all my fault.

323
00:25:53,774 --> 00:25:55,169
<i>Hyung.</i>

324
00:25:55,879 --> 00:25:58,103
Let's talk again soon.

325
00:25:58,825 --> 00:26:00,576
Right.

326
00:26:08,193 --> 00:26:09,896
Seonbaenim.

327
00:26:10,161 --> 00:26:11,135
Did you look into it?

328
00:26:11,243 --> 00:26:14,196
There's a boat headed
for Hong Kong in Incheon.

329
00:26:14,292 --> 00:26:15,378
Do they allow smuggling?

330
00:26:15,487 --> 00:26:18,565
That's what they do for a living.

331
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,501
There's no time to waste.

332
00:26:20,681 --> 00:26:23,172
Get in contact with them,
and get a spot on that boat.

333
00:26:23,261 --> 00:26:24,337
Yes, Seonbaenim.

334
00:26:24,445 --> 00:26:28,863
You must never reveal our identities.

335
00:26:29,903 --> 00:26:31,887
Don't worry.

336
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,011
<i>If you don't have it, then too bad.</i>

337
00:26:43,155 --> 00:26:48,771
<i>But if you really do,
we must make the best use of it.</i>

338
00:26:49,048 --> 00:26:52,427
<i>Only then we can save our company.</i>

339
00:26:53,461 --> 00:26:55,251
Fine...

340
00:26:55,986 --> 00:26:58,846
I even killed someone for this.

341
00:27:00,049 --> 00:27:02,670
I can't just get rid of it.

342
00:27:20,644 --> 00:27:22,423
Come in.

343
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,511
Go ahead and open it.

344
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:48,578
What you were so anxiously
looking for is inside here.

345
00:27:55,547 --> 00:27:57,196
<i>Take a look.</i>

346
00:27:57,723 --> 00:27:59,889
It's Chairman Hong's account, right?

347
00:28:03,145 --> 00:28:07,210
And why do you have this?

348
00:28:08,184 --> 00:28:09,158
What?

349
00:28:09,404 --> 00:28:13,415
Did you kill Chairman Hong?

350
00:28:15,506 --> 00:28:18,067
Are you the one who killed him?

351
00:28:19,073 --> 00:28:22,096
And why would that matter now?

352
00:28:22,252 --> 00:28:23,515
You said that with this in our hands...

353
00:28:23,575 --> 00:28:25,619
You idiot!

354
00:28:27,605 --> 00:28:29,030
Dad...

355
00:28:30,522 --> 00:28:33,732
What... 
What the hell happened to you?

356
00:28:33,901 --> 00:28:36,185
My son kills a man?!

357
00:28:36,726 --> 00:28:39,636
You pathetic fool...

358
00:28:39,745 --> 00:28:45,012
I just wanted to make you happy, Dad.

359
00:28:45,168 --> 00:28:47,092
You useless fool...

360
00:28:47,862 --> 00:28:50,483
I wanted to make a good impression,

361
00:28:51,882 --> 00:28:55,294
and at least give you 
a little help, that's all.

362
00:28:58,582 --> 00:29:00,813
You're right...

363
00:29:03,717 --> 00:29:07,726
It's not your fault.

364
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:17,430
When someone ends in this state, 
his parents are always to blame.

365
00:29:19,487 --> 00:29:22,158
I didn't raise you properly.

366
00:29:22,747 --> 00:29:24,539
It's all my fault.

367
00:29:24,671 --> 00:29:28,327
Right... I'm the pathetic fool here.

368
00:29:29,061 --> 00:29:32,452
And what did I do wrong?

369
00:29:33,457 --> 00:29:36,541
I just was unlucky, that's all!

370
00:29:36,818 --> 00:29:40,750
All I wanted was to be 
acknowledged by you!

371
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:46,089
Yeah... I know.

372
00:29:46,901 --> 00:29:48,685
Of course I know, you silly.

373
00:29:48,793 --> 00:29:50,765
The hell do you know?

374
00:29:51,082 --> 00:29:53,410
Do you even realize how I feel?

375
00:29:53,843 --> 00:29:56,357
First Jeongyeon upstages me,
then Gangmo takes my place...

376
00:29:56,453 --> 00:30:00,638
Do you know how it really feels like to 
be considered a nuisance no matter what?

377
00:30:04,283 --> 00:30:05,545
Jeongshik...

378
00:30:05,725 --> 00:30:08,611
Stay away...

379
00:30:09,465 --> 00:30:11,822
If you could only accept me,

380
00:30:11,978 --> 00:30:14,963
I would enter a prison cell
right away with no regrets.

381
00:30:15,589 --> 00:30:17,621
But what is this?

382
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:21,072
What the hell is all this?

383
00:31:09,686 --> 00:31:12,211
Why don't you get up now?

384
00:31:15,241 --> 00:31:16,973
Jeongyeon.

385
00:31:17,847 --> 00:31:21,444
You... You...

386
00:31:21,841 --> 00:31:27,577
Can't you close an eye 
just this once?

387
00:31:29,212 --> 00:31:31,810
<i>For your father's sake,</i>

388
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:35,627
can't you feign ignorance 
just for once?

389
00:31:35,771 --> 00:31:38,032
And what about Gangmo?

390
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:42,782
He's like a son to you!

391
00:31:44,691 --> 00:31:49,818
I will do everything I can for him.

392
00:31:50,059 --> 00:31:52,007
Dad...

393
00:32:01,718 --> 00:32:03,070
Dad.

394
00:32:03,214 --> 00:32:04,718
You can't do this.

395
00:32:04,862 --> 00:32:06,233
Don't do it, Dad.

396
00:32:06,389 --> 00:32:08,085
Jeongyeon.

397
00:32:08,698 --> 00:32:11,897
You can't realize
what I'm going through.

398
00:32:12,537 --> 00:32:17,364
When you get children of your own, 
you'll understand.

399
00:32:18,831 --> 00:32:25,253
I can make it up for all 
Gangmo is going through anytime.

400
00:32:25,385 --> 00:32:30,637
But when a parent 
ruins his child's life,

401
00:32:31,755 --> 00:32:34,773
there's nothing 
that can make up for that.

402
00:32:35,663 --> 00:32:37,864
Dad...

403
00:32:39,684 --> 00:32:42,346
I'm sorry, Jeongyeon.

404
00:33:23,707 --> 00:33:25,257
Hello?

405
00:33:28,528 --> 00:33:29,814
Gangmo?

406
00:33:30,043 --> 00:33:31,546
<i>Shideok.</i>

407
00:33:31,786 --> 00:33:33,650
Where on earth are you?

408
00:33:33,771 --> 00:33:36,992
<i>It's an islet in the
outskirts of Incheon.</i>

409
00:33:37,185 --> 00:33:39,301
Incheon where?

410
00:33:40,005 --> 00:33:43,342
Shouldn't you at least
tell me where you are?

411
00:33:44,532 --> 00:33:46,552
Wait.

412
00:33:48,805 --> 00:33:50,328
Agasshi?

413
00:33:50,713 --> 00:33:52,637
Is she doing well?

414
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:55,860
<i>She's getting married soon.</i>

415
00:33:57,092 --> 00:33:58,580
<i>My mother told me.</i>

416
00:33:58,689 --> 00:34:02,140
<i>That Jo Minwoo's family seems to be 
rushing to get them married.</i>

417
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:07,202
<i>Gangmo.</i>

418
00:34:07,371 --> 00:34:09,283
<i>Are you listening?</i>

419
00:34:11,256 --> 00:34:17,441
Take good care of her.

420
00:34:17,792 --> 00:34:20,796
<i>Is Jeongyeon the problem now?</i>

421
00:34:23,382 --> 00:34:26,286
She can do nothing by herself.

422
00:34:28,197 --> 00:34:30,195
So you at least look after her.

423
00:34:30,363 --> 00:34:33,562
<i>Aigoo... You silly fool.</i>

424
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:41,227
Also, should she ever worry about me,

425
00:34:42,946 --> 00:34:45,315
tell her I'm all right,

426
00:34:49,103 --> 00:34:54,410
to live happily with Jo Minwoo.

427
00:34:56,034 --> 00:34:57,982
Just say that.

428
00:34:58,869 --> 00:35:01,192
<i>Hey... Lee Gangmo!</i>

429
00:35:10,521 --> 00:35:12,073
Shideok.

430
00:35:12,266 --> 00:35:14,598
Didn't Gangmo call you?

431
00:35:16,376 --> 00:35:19,044
You still haven't 
heard a thing from him?

432
00:35:20,054 --> 00:35:21,629
Nothing.

433
00:35:30,588 --> 00:35:33,061
<i>~ West Sea Lodge ~
Ganghwa-Gun, Gyeonggi Province</i>

434
00:35:39,651 --> 00:35:41,686
Looking for this?

435
00:35:43,484 --> 00:35:46,374
This is where Gangmo is staying, right?

436
00:35:47,047 --> 00:35:48,226
Give it back.

437
00:35:48,298 --> 00:35:51,184
Gangmo is hiding here, right?

438
00:35:51,352 --> 00:35:53,384
I said give it to me!

439
00:35:56,141 --> 00:35:58,255
For whose sake did Gangmo 
end up in this mess?

440
00:35:58,339 --> 00:36:01,026
It's all because of you!

441
00:36:01,592 --> 00:36:03,167
What are you trying to say?

442
00:36:03,552 --> 00:36:04,802
Because of me?!

443
00:36:04,911 --> 00:36:08,602
Why do you think he's always been 
so stupidly loyal to the chairman?

444
00:36:08,771 --> 00:36:11,645
So that one day, whenever
it might be, you'll be his,

445
00:36:11,717 --> 00:36:15,899
because of love or whatever that 
nonsense is called... That's what!

446
00:36:17,028 --> 00:36:21,106
You can just get married with
Jo Minwoo and it'll be all over,

447
00:36:22,044 --> 00:36:25,934
but what is going 
to happen to Gangmo?

448
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,358
Stop making that 
poor fool suffer so much.

449
00:36:43,475 --> 00:36:45,856
Gangmo...

450
00:37:23,136 --> 00:37:25,663
<i>If that's the kind of marriage
you'll get into, just don't!</i>

451
00:37:25,833 --> 00:37:29,100
I'll help the chairman get out.

452
00:37:29,285 --> 00:37:31,878
There's no need to bow down to people
like them, or let them trample on you!

453
00:37:31,926 --> 00:37:34,778
You just...
Just have faith in me.

454
00:37:34,946 --> 00:37:39,527
Aren't you tired of that?

455
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:42,834
All you ever do to me is giving.

456
00:37:42,931 --> 00:37:45,372
You never received anything in return.

457
00:37:46,045 --> 00:37:48,561
All I am to you is a burden.

458
00:37:48,646 --> 00:37:50,293
Haven't you had enough of that?

459
00:37:50,425 --> 00:37:51,760
I sure have.

460
00:37:51,892 --> 00:37:57,219
But marrying Jo Minwoo... No way.

461
00:37:57,818 --> 00:37:59,011
Why?

462
00:37:59,156 --> 00:38:01,455
Because I...

463
00:38:04,958 --> 00:38:07,023
don't want you to marry.

464
00:38:29,956 --> 00:38:32,962
If you do it this way it's 10, 35, 45.

465
00:38:33,046 --> 00:38:35,042
The answer is right there
under your eyes if you do.

466
00:38:35,115 --> 00:38:36,822
Got it?

467
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,459
Lee Gangmo.

468
00:38:48,969 --> 00:38:50,987
Do you like me or something?

469
00:38:53,916 --> 00:38:57,953
Hey...
Think you're that pretty?

470
00:38:59,982 --> 00:39:02,559
I only like girls with pretty faces.

471
00:39:09,038 --> 00:39:11,239
Gangmo...

472
00:39:14,594 --> 00:39:17,600
What can we do now?

473
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:24,302
What can I do?

474
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:06,236
The morning air sure
feels tense around here...

475
00:40:06,416 --> 00:40:10,565
Jeongshik. Did you do something
to upset your father again?

476
00:40:11,632 --> 00:40:12,669
Honey.

477
00:40:12,789 --> 00:40:15,020
What did he do this time?

478
00:40:15,785 --> 00:40:17,989
Just eat your breakfast.

479
00:40:19,996 --> 00:40:20,934
Chairman.

480
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:22,630
Chairman, this is serious.

481
00:40:22,726 --> 00:40:25,251
Your daughter...
Aigoo... What now...

482
00:40:25,336 --> 00:40:26,298
Jeongyeon what?

483
00:40:26,358 --> 00:40:29,026
She's not in her room.

484
00:40:29,122 --> 00:40:31,775
Did she ever have breakfast 
together with us?

485
00:40:31,901 --> 00:40:33,582
That's not what I mean.

486
00:40:33,694 --> 00:40:35,520
Go look for yourself.

487
00:40:35,613 --> 00:40:37,949
Her wardrobe is all over the place,

488
00:40:38,069 --> 00:40:40,623
so she... must have run away.

489
00:40:41,141 --> 00:40:42,295
What?

490
00:40:42,547 --> 00:40:44,916
Jeongyeon ran away?!

491
00:41:00,394 --> 00:41:03,003
<i>~ West Sea Lodge ~
Ganghwa-Gun, Gyeonggi Province</i>

492
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:08,213
It's pretty.

493
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:10,414
I like it.

494
00:42:11,099 --> 00:42:15,176
But didn't you already get engaged?

495
00:42:15,284 --> 00:42:18,671
One thing led to another, and I still 
didn't get the chance to propose properly.

496
00:42:18,876 --> 00:42:21,894
I'll make it official today.

497
00:42:46,921 --> 00:42:49,570
Hangang Hotel, come on out, quick!

498
00:42:49,666 --> 00:42:51,664
<i>Thank you. Quick.</i>

499
00:42:51,815 --> 00:42:53,363
<i>Hurry up.</i>

500
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:55,690
Quick.

501
00:43:00,581 --> 00:43:04,191
That guy... He looks familiar?!

502
00:43:07,017 --> 00:43:08,797
All right!

503
00:43:41,684 --> 00:43:45,169
<i>~ West Sea Lodge ~</i>

504
00:44:38,832 --> 00:44:41,717
The sea smells nice.

505
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:46,936
Hey... Did you want to
keep all this for yourself?

506
00:44:49,509 --> 00:44:51,433
What's with that look?

507
00:44:51,662 --> 00:44:54,752
Do you know how hard
finding you has been?

508
00:44:55,221 --> 00:44:56,542
Agasshi.

509
00:44:56,662 --> 00:44:58,682
Don't call me that.

510
00:44:59,163 --> 00:45:02,915
I don't ever want 
to hear you call me that.

511
00:45:05,946 --> 00:45:07,737
There still must be a bus going back.

512
00:45:07,918 --> 00:45:09,313
Let go!

513
00:45:09,649 --> 00:45:10,792
I'm not going back.

514
00:45:10,864 --> 00:45:12,704
Hey... Hwang Jeongyeon.

515
00:45:13,028 --> 00:45:15,566
The room is larger than I thought?!

516
00:45:15,698 --> 00:45:19,931
- And the owner seems really nice...
- Why are you so immature?

517
00:45:22,154 --> 00:45:24,193
I'm wanted by the police.

518
00:45:24,308 --> 00:45:26,642
Stay with me and you'll be 
in danger as well, can't you get it?

519
00:45:26,774 --> 00:45:28,751
And so what?

520
00:45:29,593 --> 00:45:31,837
As if you didn't go 
through hell because of me.

521
00:45:31,993 --> 00:45:34,338
Why can't I do the same?

522
00:45:35,569 --> 00:45:37,170
Just go back.

523
00:45:38,084 --> 00:45:39,551
Forget it.

524
00:45:40,252 --> 00:45:42,340
I expected you to react this way.

525
00:45:42,449 --> 00:45:43,411
You must go back.

526
00:45:43,495 --> 00:45:45,575
- I'm not going home!
- You really!

527
00:45:45,683 --> 00:45:47,968
I missed you, Gangmo.

528
00:45:53,026 --> 00:45:55,587
I missed you.

529
00:45:57,142 --> 00:45:59,543
So much I couldn't take it anymore.

530
00:46:00,999 --> 00:46:03,816
I really missed you.

531
00:46:44,631 --> 00:46:46,735
Ohh... You're back?

532
00:46:48,062 --> 00:46:50,234
Have a seat. You must be hungry.

533
00:46:52,218 --> 00:46:56,151
Must be because we're right next
to the sea, but fish is really cheap.

534
00:46:56,403 --> 00:46:58,831
Don't really know what it'll taste like.

535
00:47:02,775 --> 00:47:07,345
Take the first bus 
back to Seoul in the morning.

536
00:47:10,963 --> 00:47:13,750
The owner gave us some kimchi as well.

537
00:47:13,907 --> 00:47:16,240
Go ahead and taste it.

538
00:47:28,121 --> 00:47:29,434
How is it?

539
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:31,130
Any good?

540
00:47:32,813 --> 00:47:35,940
It is?! It's got to be.

541
00:47:36,084 --> 00:47:38,026
Might have only learned
over the maid's shoulders,

542
00:47:38,098 --> 00:47:40,022
but I've got an eye for this.

543
00:47:40,353 --> 00:47:45,614
Consider this an honor, it's the 
first time I personally cook something.

544
00:47:53,079 --> 00:47:56,510
Take it easy!
You'll get indigestion.

545
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:07,864
Aww... Salty...

546
00:48:08,225 --> 00:48:11,063
Stop eating it, it's too salty.

547
00:48:11,456 --> 00:48:13,155
I said stop it.

548
00:48:13,336 --> 00:48:14,899
Isn't it salty to you?

549
00:48:15,007 --> 00:48:17,863
Who made this for me?

550
00:48:19,186 --> 00:48:22,842
If I add some water and heat it again, 
will it get any better?

551
00:48:23,176 --> 00:48:24,730
It's fine.

552
00:48:24,958 --> 00:48:26,521
Aww... So annoying.

553
00:48:26,642 --> 00:48:29,383
Why is it so salty here?

554
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,409
<i>Take a look.</i>

555
00:48:45,216 --> 00:48:47,317
This way.

556
00:48:53,238 --> 00:48:55,398
Hey... Lee Gangmo!

557
00:49:09,715 --> 00:49:12,984
<i>He's still there?!</i>

558
00:49:13,863 --> 00:49:16,517
Who could he be waiting for,
for so long?

559
00:49:16,793 --> 00:49:18,982
That's so sad...

560
00:49:32,332 --> 00:49:34,246
<i>Wipe it.</i>

561
00:49:37,673 --> 00:49:39,086
Ehh... Really...

562
00:49:39,183 --> 00:49:41,104
You made it worse!

563
00:49:41,925 --> 00:49:43,932
Ahh... Right!

564
00:49:44,293 --> 00:49:46,337
The laundry bill.

565
00:49:54,784 --> 00:49:56,612
Excuse me.

566
00:50:02,348 --> 00:50:05,887
For the laundry bill.

567
00:50:06,759 --> 00:50:10,729
Don't you remember last time, 
at the police station?

568
00:50:12,822 --> 00:50:14,878
Will you get out of my sight?

569
00:50:16,706 --> 00:50:21,501
Don't be too angry if who
you're waiting for is not coming.

570
00:50:26,781 --> 00:50:28,139
What?

571
00:50:28,584 --> 00:50:31,530
I know from personal experience.

572
00:50:32,035 --> 00:50:38,239
Even those who can't come 
will feel anxious.

573
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:41,233
What are you, trying to rile me up?

574
00:50:42,175 --> 00:50:43,470
What?

575
00:51:11,562 --> 00:51:14,000
You've come...

576
00:51:15,634 --> 00:51:17,752
Let me do it.

577
00:51:24,301 --> 00:51:29,959
Hwang Taeseop, that fella
defied my expectations.

578
00:51:32,966 --> 00:51:35,118
Take good care of him.

579
00:51:35,262 --> 00:51:39,110
But you must never forget that,
the more important the customer,

580
00:51:39,314 --> 00:51:44,291
the more dangerous any
personal attachment will become.

581
00:51:45,674 --> 00:51:48,632
I feel no such sentiment for him.

582
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:53,098
Same goes for your daughter.

583
00:51:53,221 --> 00:51:59,935
If she will one day inherit the company,
she must remain nothing but a customer.

584
00:52:03,772 --> 00:52:06,415
I will keep it in mind.

585
00:52:22,803 --> 00:52:24,523
<i>Are you sleeping?</i>

586
00:52:24,799 --> 00:52:26,423
No.

587
00:52:28,659 --> 00:52:30,343
You don't have enough blankets, I bet?

588
00:52:30,511 --> 00:52:32,195
Use these.

589
00:52:32,652 --> 00:52:33,727
We were just fine...

590
00:52:33,799 --> 00:52:36,854
It will be too hard on your backs.

591
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:41,615
Aigoo... She sure is pretty.

592
00:52:43,033 --> 00:52:45,504
It's good to be young...

593
00:53:05,219 --> 00:53:06,780
Aren't you going to sleep?

594
00:53:07,622 --> 00:53:09,882
You go ahead.

595
00:53:24,717 --> 00:53:26,533
Gangmo.

596
00:53:27,824 --> 00:53:29,922
Hurry up and sleep.

597
00:53:30,991 --> 00:53:33,313
You need to catch 
the first bus tomorrow.

598
00:53:35,824 --> 00:53:40,408
I can't forgive my family
for what they did to you.

599
00:53:40,793 --> 00:53:43,306
So what are you going to do?

600
00:53:45,356 --> 00:53:48,236
I'll spend the 
rest of my life with you.

601
00:53:49,198 --> 00:53:51,110
Whichever path you take.

602
00:53:51,531 --> 00:53:52,998
Wake up, Hwang Jeongyeon!

603
00:53:53,094 --> 00:53:55,307
You're about to get married.

604
00:53:55,511 --> 00:53:59,816
No... I'm not marrying Jo Minwoo.

605
00:54:00,129 --> 00:54:02,702
I couldn't possibly do that now.

606
00:54:03,905 --> 00:54:06,701
And that's because of you, Gangmo.

607
00:54:11,017 --> 00:54:15,665
What are you, pitying me?

608
00:54:16,697 --> 00:54:20,405
Just because I was accused 
of murder instead of Jeongshik?

609
00:54:21,776 --> 00:54:27,548
I have no use for your compassion,
so take the first bus in the morning.

610
00:54:34,266 --> 00:54:37,193
Must have been when I was little.

611
00:54:39,794 --> 00:54:42,572
When I realized that 
everyone had a mother,

612
00:54:43,329 --> 00:54:45,987
except me.

613
00:54:49,069 --> 00:54:52,877
It was then that I started
looking over my shoulders.

614
00:54:53,803 --> 00:54:55,611
<i>Thinking that,</i>

615
00:54:56,801 --> 00:55:00,060
<i>if I did so, my mother 
could be looking at me.</i>

616
00:55:00,746 --> 00:55:02,453
But...

617
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:07,684
You know that I've picked up 
that habit once again?

618
00:55:08,863 --> 00:55:13,181
<i>When I turn back,
you should be there looking at me.</i>

619
00:55:14,131 --> 00:55:18,652
<i>When I call your name, 
you should appear right away.</i>

620
00:55:19,109 --> 00:55:24,462
But I can't find you 
no matter where I look.

621
00:55:31,473 --> 00:55:33,854
I just thought...

622
00:55:35,742 --> 00:55:41,541
I thought it was just making me
uncomfortable, or something.

623
00:55:43,128 --> 00:55:48,431
<i>But that wasn't the reason.</i>

624
00:55:50,184 --> 00:55:53,844
Just like when I realized
I didn't have a mother,

625
00:55:55,211 --> 00:55:57,464
it was as if...

626
00:55:59,725 --> 00:56:03,862
my entire heart was
suddenly taken away from me.

627
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:08,095
Hey... Hwang Jeongyeon...

628
00:56:13,563 --> 00:56:15,863
You like me, too.

629
00:56:16,527 --> 00:56:19,770
You're in love with me too, you silly!

630
00:56:22,187 --> 00:56:23,786
No.

631
00:56:24,950 --> 00:56:31,500
I have never been attracted
to you, not even once.

632
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:41,637
Gangmo...

633
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:52,196
I merely wanted to 
impress the chairman!

634
00:56:56,432 --> 00:56:59,107
Because you and I are just friends.

635
00:57:01,416 --> 00:57:04,350
This is the very first time...

636
00:57:06,383 --> 00:57:08,126
you lie to me.

637
00:57:08,751 --> 00:57:11,280
Stop fooling yourself!

638
00:57:11,545 --> 00:57:13,818
So you think I was in love with you?!

639
00:57:14,443 --> 00:57:19,914
Why, don't you know that such sentiments 
are nothing but a luxury to me?

640
00:57:20,552 --> 00:57:24,511
<i>I just wanted to succeed.</i>

641
00:57:26,208 --> 00:57:27,351
That is all.

642
00:57:27,495 --> 00:57:29,407
Are we clear?

643
00:57:37,755 --> 00:57:40,345
I will soon leave this country.

644
00:57:41,996 --> 00:57:43,856
So, from here on in,

645
00:57:44,830 --> 00:57:47,187
stop bothering me.

646
00:58:07,734 --> 00:58:09,562
You idiot!

647
00:58:09,923 --> 00:58:13,145
What am I supposed to do?

648
00:58:15,971 --> 00:58:19,573
Stop making me suffer so much!

649
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:22,206
It's driving me crazy...

650
00:58:22,327 --> 00:58:25,188
I can't take it anymore!

651
00:58:26,668 --> 00:58:29,155
You fool...

652
00:58:32,791 --> 00:58:35,605
Jeongyeon!

653
00:58:40,861 --> 00:58:44,284
Jeongyeon...

654
00:59:05,826 --> 00:59:07,943
I will get going.

655
00:59:08,349 --> 00:59:09,578
Listen.

656
00:59:10,018 --> 00:59:13,690
Tell Jeongyeon we need to meet today.

657
00:59:13,942 --> 00:59:17,069
There are so many
preparations for the wedding,

658
00:59:17,153 --> 00:59:21,025
how could she just ignore it all 
without showing up once?

659
00:59:22,011 --> 00:59:26,701
Think bringing in a working daughter-in-law
would be that easy to deal with?

660
00:59:27,038 --> 00:59:29,791
Don't get me started.
Jeongyeon...

661
00:59:29,912 --> 00:59:33,554
I just feel like she's looking
down on us, that's why I'm upset.

662
00:59:33,667 --> 00:59:35,083
It's not that.

663
00:59:35,215 --> 00:59:36,477
Look at him.

664
00:59:36,610 --> 00:59:40,204
Aigoo... Already taking her side...

665
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:42,882
Let me handle it.

666
01:00:00,911 --> 01:00:02,066
Did you find her?

667
01:00:02,174 --> 01:00:05,582
I even asked all her school friends,
but nobody had a clue.

668
01:00:05,773 --> 01:00:08,610
Even if you get your
entire team on it, find her,

669
01:00:08,779 --> 01:00:10,258
and file a missing report 
with the police.

670
01:00:10,354 --> 01:00:11,929
The police?!

671
01:00:12,483 --> 01:00:15,706
I get goosebumps 
just hearing that name,

672
01:00:15,789 --> 01:00:19,092
why would you bother with them?

673
01:00:19,590 --> 01:00:22,327
What if Jeongyeon went
looking for Lee Gangmo?

674
01:00:22,447 --> 01:00:23,638
What?

675
01:00:24,395 --> 01:00:25,381
Hey...

676
01:00:25,466 --> 01:00:27,690
Aren't we losing ourselves 
in wild conjecture?

677
01:00:27,799 --> 01:00:30,309
If my father learns of this, 
it's all over.

678
01:00:30,415 --> 01:00:32,612
Call them right now... Do it!

679
01:00:32,708 --> 01:00:35,365
Ehh... You really...
That temper...

680
01:00:35,657 --> 01:00:37,578
All right.

681
01:00:44,038 --> 01:00:51,370
Is it true you'll join the
by-election race as an independent?

682
01:00:51,634 --> 01:00:54,003
Is there anything wrong with that?

683
01:00:55,486 --> 01:00:57,996
The opposition candidate 
is no pushover.

684
01:00:58,176 --> 01:01:01,074
With majority in Congress
depending on a handful of votes,

685
01:01:01,218 --> 01:01:07,328
why would you enter the race and
hog votes, messing up the whole thing?

686
01:01:07,527 --> 01:01:12,153
I'm not merely joining this race
to disturb opponents, but to win it.

687
01:01:16,184 --> 01:01:17,907
Will you really keep this up?

688
01:01:18,088 --> 01:01:21,731
Didn't you hear me asking you for a little
patience until the next recommendation?

689
01:01:21,839 --> 01:01:24,377
You were the first not to live up 
to your end of the bargain.

690
01:01:24,473 --> 01:01:25,878
Look, Director Jo!

691
01:01:25,938 --> 01:01:30,399
Seems like you're banking
on Chairman Hwang Taeseop,

692
01:01:30,952 --> 01:01:34,596
but he can't go on much longer 
funding you every step of the way.

693
01:01:35,017 --> 01:01:39,190
As you're well aware, the estate 
market is scraping the bottom.

694
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:42,322
Not to mention the expenses
for their subway construction,

695
01:01:42,478 --> 01:01:44,487
so he'll soon run out of options.

696
01:01:44,655 --> 01:01:49,174
That's not for you to be worried about.

697
01:01:50,505 --> 01:01:52,287
I didn't say I'm worried,

698
01:01:52,431 --> 01:01:55,197
but merely pointing out 
how things really stand.

699
01:01:58,839 --> 01:02:00,981
If you'll excuse me, I'll get going.

700
01:02:01,149 --> 01:02:04,336
Director Min will soon be here.

701
01:02:04,529 --> 01:02:09,551
Let's deal with this here and now!

702
01:02:13,784 --> 01:02:15,732
That fella...

703
01:02:16,598 --> 01:02:18,945
He really refuses to listen.

704
01:02:19,029 --> 01:02:21,807
Don't tell me you're leaving already?

705
01:02:25,534 --> 01:02:28,916
Where are you hiding Lee Gangmo?

706
01:02:29,812 --> 01:02:32,748
Those who helped 
him escape were pros.

707
01:02:32,859 --> 01:02:34,780
Think I don't know 
you were behind this?

708
01:02:34,852 --> 01:02:36,211
Listen...

709
01:02:36,716 --> 01:02:41,634
Forget all the rest, how about letting 
fair play dominate these elections?

710
01:02:41,742 --> 01:02:46,065
Hearing that from you 
makes me even more suspicious.

711
01:02:55,745 --> 01:02:59,375
We must get our hands on
Lee Gangmo before the elections.

712
01:02:59,459 --> 01:03:02,165
We're using everything
at our disposal to find him.

713
01:03:02,237 --> 01:03:05,941
Look at every port in the country.

714
01:03:06,274 --> 01:03:06,843
What?

715
01:03:06,915 --> 01:03:08,911
If what I suspect is true,

716
01:03:09,079 --> 01:03:12,230
he will try to smuggle
himself out of the country.

717
01:03:12,374 --> 01:03:13,856
Sm...Smuggle?!

718
01:03:13,984 --> 01:03:17,866
Discreetly open a cooperative
investigation with the police.

719
01:03:18,262 --> 01:03:20,559
Once you find smuggling brokers,

720
01:03:20,631 --> 01:03:23,312
you will surely get
to the bottom of this.

721
01:03:23,995 --> 01:03:26,722
All right, Director.

722
01:03:34,130 --> 01:03:35,969
- Hello?
- It's me, Hyung.

723
01:03:36,030 --> 01:03:37,665
How did it go?

724
01:03:41,077 --> 01:03:42,640
Hong Kong?!

725
01:03:42,857 --> 01:03:45,009
There is a boat 
headed for Hong Kong.

726
01:03:45,117 --> 01:03:48,865
I'll soon get you 
a spot there, so get ready.

727
01:03:49,127 --> 01:03:50,967
All right, Hyung.

728
01:05:02,355 --> 01:05:06,490
<i>Will you marry me?</i>

729
01:05:31,342 --> 01:05:32,650
All right.

730
01:05:33,554 --> 01:05:35,526
Stop!

731
01:05:35,675 --> 01:05:39,146
Stop!

732
01:06:04,923 --> 01:06:07,421
Ehh... You silly fool.

733
01:06:09,108 --> 01:06:14,636
If we were going to break up anyway,
should at least have not hurt her.

734
01:06:15,141 --> 01:06:17,870
Ahh... You idiot.

On The Next Episode of
~ GIANT ~

742
01:06:53,418 --> 01:06:55,847
- Where is Seongmo?
- He went to Incheon Port.

743
01:06:55,943 --> 01:06:58,709
Jeongyeon can't come with you.

744
01:06:58,805 --> 01:07:02,223
<i>Hwang Taeseop and
Jo Pilyeon were responsible...</i>

745
01:07:02,391 --> 01:07:04,015
for our father's death.

746
01:07:04,099 --> 01:07:06,708
Find from which port a boat
headed for Hong Kong is leaving.

747
01:07:06,817 --> 01:07:08,392
<i>So you're suggesting
he's smuggling himself out?</i>

748
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:10,244
<i>It's foolproof evidence.</i>

749
01:07:10,304 --> 01:07:12,637
Did you know Lee Gangmo
had land in his name?

750
01:07:12,697 --> 01:07:14,705
We must get our hands on that land.

751
01:07:14,801 --> 01:07:16,761
Kill Lee Gangmo.

752
01:07:16,858 --> 01:07:18,637
<i>Leave revenge to me.</i>

753
01:07:18,721 --> 01:07:20,285
<i>There's no need 
for you to get involved.</i>

754
01:07:20,393 --> 01:07:22,582
<i>I'll avenge what they did my own way.</i>

755
01:07:22,678 --> 01:07:25,456
<i>By destroying Manbo Construction.</i>
