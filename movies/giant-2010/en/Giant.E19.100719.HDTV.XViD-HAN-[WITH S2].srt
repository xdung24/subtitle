5
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:40,262
You still haven't left?

6
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,815
I can't go home.

7
00:00:46,156 --> 00:00:48,696
I couldn't possibly face...

8
00:00:52,571 --> 00:00:58,735
my father and the rest of my family.

9
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:04,537
Dad!

10
00:01:04,622 --> 00:01:06,116
Dad, you can't do this.

11
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:07,951
Don't do it, Dad.

12
00:01:08,184 --> 00:01:10,665
I'm sorry, Jeongyeon.

13
00:01:27,496 --> 00:01:28,958
Jeongyeon.

14
00:01:29,056 --> 00:01:33,767
Did you really mean what
you told me yesterday?

15
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:36,515
Have you really...

16
00:01:38,312 --> 00:01:41,261
never been attracted to me?

17
00:01:45,008 --> 00:01:47,407
You've never been...

18
00:01:48,434 --> 00:01:51,188
in love with me?!

19
00:01:55,802 --> 00:01:57,381
Yeah.

20
00:02:03,577 --> 00:02:05,642
I meant it.

21
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:14,565
I see...

22
00:02:24,836 --> 00:02:26,990
Then...

23
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:32,571
Where can I go now?

24
00:02:33,994 --> 00:02:40,575
I have a hard time taking 
care of myself as it is.

25
00:02:42,633 --> 00:02:49,697
Go and worry about your own life now.

26
00:03:34,226 --> 00:03:37,306
Jeongyeon... Jeongyeon!!

27
00:03:49,753 --> 00:03:53,396
- Let go!
- Stop it!

28
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:15,209
- Hwang Jeongyeon!
- I love you.

29
00:04:17,765 --> 00:04:20,224
I said I love you!

30
00:04:22,709 --> 00:04:25,388
I love you, Gangmo!

31
00:04:36,152 --> 00:04:38,168
Follow me!

32
00:04:55,624 --> 00:04:57,913
I'm going to leave soon.

33
00:04:58,096 --> 00:05:03,473
Can you follow me, wherever I go?

34
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:07,132
It will be hard to bear.

35
00:05:11,679 --> 00:05:14,927
We can't possibly predict
what difficulties we'll be facing.

36
00:05:15,723 --> 00:05:17,387
But you still...

37
00:05:18,872 --> 00:05:21,304
You'll have to give everything up.

38
00:05:22,632 --> 00:05:24,192
Your dreams...

39
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:26,273
Your family.

40
00:05:26,986 --> 00:05:29,642
Maybe even the life you're living now.

41
00:05:29,887 --> 00:05:31,882
I'll come.

42
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,725
Together with you.

43
00:05:37,753 --> 00:05:40,437
Wherever it might be, 
it doesn't matter.

44
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:50,395
Have you seen?

45
00:05:54,352 --> 00:05:58,319
From here on in,
Hwang Jeongyeon is mine.

46
00:06:06,886 --> 00:06:08,819
I, Lee Gangmo,

47
00:06:09,027 --> 00:06:15,404
join Hwang Jeongyeon 
in marriage here and now.

48
00:06:16,714 --> 00:06:19,014
<i>I have nothing to give her,</i>

49
00:06:19,871 --> 00:06:23,457
but I'll love her more
than anyone in the world.

50
00:06:25,232 --> 00:06:31,376
May you watch over us, 
and help me give her happiness.

51
00:07:22,117 --> 00:07:33,951
<i>{\a6}~ Affection by Jeon Youngrok ~</i>

52
00:07:22,117 --> 00:07:33,951
You will leave my side
before the sun sets,

53
00:07:35,078 --> 00:07:45,602
For what will be our last farewell.

54
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,391
Ahh... I'll be damned.

55
00:08:36,693 --> 00:08:38,074
Jeongyeon.

56
00:08:40,523 --> 00:08:41,502
What?

57
00:08:41,649 --> 00:08:46,067
I brought some hot water...

58
00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:47,450
I'm fine.

59
00:08:47,573 --> 00:08:51,000
If I leave it here, it'll get cold.

60
00:08:51,428 --> 00:08:55,370
<i>It's all right with me,
so I'll just come in a second.</i>

61
00:08:55,542 --> 00:08:57,475
I'm fine... Don't.

62
00:08:58,024 --> 00:08:59,636
What?

63
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:07,695
- I'll leave it here.
- Th...anks.

64
00:09:13,435 --> 00:09:15,184
Ahh... It's hot!

65
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:18,440
- Are you all right?
- It's okay.

66
00:09:22,804 --> 00:09:24,428
Did he look?!

67
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:26,802
I'm sure he didn't...

68
00:09:28,222 --> 00:09:31,446
If I had known earlier,
I could have gone on a diet.

69
00:09:32,236 --> 00:09:35,424
Why is it so hot?

70
00:09:52,134 --> 00:09:55,231
This looks like fun?!

71
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:03,549
Aren't you washing up?

72
00:10:06,988 --> 00:10:09,216
Already did it earlier on?

73
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:17,710
Should I just do it again?

74
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:20,439
I kept sweating and stuff.

75
00:10:23,965 --> 00:10:28,285
It's all right.
Why bother doing it again?

76
00:10:31,467 --> 00:10:33,107
Really?

77
00:10:38,246 --> 00:10:40,106
Seems like you're done?

78
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,611
Uh?

79
00:10:42,613 --> 00:10:44,952
Your hair, it's dry already.

80
00:10:54,728 --> 00:10:56,283
Aren't you tired?

81
00:10:57,763 --> 00:10:59,771
Should I turn off the light?

82
00:11:00,848 --> 00:11:03,760
Yeah... Let's do that.

83
00:11:54,705 --> 00:11:56,507
What is it?

84
00:11:56,838 --> 00:11:58,699
Nothing.

85
00:12:05,614 --> 00:12:07,119
What?

86
00:12:12,353 --> 00:12:13,100
What?

87
00:12:13,198 --> 00:12:15,156
This is really awkward.

88
00:12:15,205 --> 00:12:16,612
Isn't it?

89
00:12:21,067 --> 00:12:23,136
Tell me about it.

90
00:12:27,185 --> 00:12:29,327
Can I hold your hand?

91
00:12:31,425 --> 00:12:33,011
Give me your hand.

92
00:12:41,502 --> 00:12:45,404
It feels good even to
only hold hands, doesn't it?

93
00:12:55,597 --> 00:12:57,677
And if I do this?

94
00:12:59,115 --> 00:13:01,667
If it feels good just by holding hands,

95
00:13:02,512 --> 00:13:04,911
how about now?

96
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,583
Clean this.

97
00:14:06,056 --> 00:14:07,928
Wipe the blood.

98
00:14:22,345 --> 00:14:24,196
You know Hwang Jeongyeon
of Manbo Construction, right?

99
00:14:24,294 --> 00:14:25,261
<i>Yes.</i>

100
00:14:25,408 --> 00:14:27,366
Find out what's going on with her.

101
00:14:27,476 --> 00:14:28,957
<i>All right.</i>

102
00:14:53,748 --> 00:14:55,376
<i>Anything new on 
Lee Gangmo's whereabouts?</i>

103
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:59,273
As you ordered, we're searching around
every port involved with smuggling.

104
00:14:59,383 --> 00:15:00,913
Where is Seongmo now?

105
00:15:01,023 --> 00:15:02,369
He went to Incheon Port.

106
00:15:02,479 --> 00:15:03,152
Incheon?!

107
00:15:03,263 --> 00:15:08,219
I'm taking care of Busan,
while Seongmo is dealing with Incheon.

108
00:15:33,264 --> 00:15:35,983
Yes... Jemul Port Coffeehouse.

109
00:15:36,142 --> 00:15:37,818
Just a moment.

110
00:15:37,941 --> 00:15:40,303
Mister Kwak? A call for you.

111
00:15:40,425 --> 00:15:42,028
Yes.

112
00:15:45,884 --> 00:15:47,622
Yes, who am I speaking to?

113
00:15:47,732 --> 00:15:49,849
<i>Did you get the goods?</i>

114
00:15:50,419 --> 00:15:52,401
Yes, I did.

115
00:15:53,307 --> 00:15:55,828
<i>They're leaving the day
after tomorrow at eight.</i>

116
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:59,010
He will be wearing
a green New Town cap.

117
00:15:59,806 --> 00:16:02,792
Let's use "lighthouse" as password.

118
00:16:05,412 --> 00:16:07,324
All right.

119
00:16:20,216 --> 00:16:22,355
Don't... Stop it!

120
00:16:22,798 --> 00:16:26,152
Look, isn't it fresh?

121
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:45,398
Gangmo. Just a moment.

122
00:17:01,509 --> 00:17:03,370
Do that again?

123
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,923
This just won't do it.

124
00:17:18,045 --> 00:17:21,362
I'll worry about groceries,
so you go back first.

125
00:17:21,635 --> 00:17:23,457
Will you be all right by yourself?

126
00:17:23,923 --> 00:17:27,105
Why? Afraid I'll get lost?

127
00:17:43,683 --> 00:17:45,042
Hyung.

128
00:17:45,372 --> 00:17:47,183
When did you get here?

129
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:48,897
Ohh... Just now.

130
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:54,758
But, tell me...
What's with those clothes?

131
00:17:57,968 --> 00:18:02,004
Actually, I was about to
call you because of that.

132
00:18:02,261 --> 00:18:05,968
Hyung, can you get me
another spot on that boat?

133
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:09,260
Were you seeing a woman?

134
00:18:10,606 --> 00:18:12,197
How much longer were you 
going to keep it secret?

135
00:18:12,283 --> 00:18:14,327
I know it won't be easy,
but help me out.

136
00:18:15,404 --> 00:18:18,463
I really want to go with her.

137
00:18:18,573 --> 00:18:20,494
What kind of woman are we dealing with?

138
00:18:21,582 --> 00:18:23,493
The one I love.

139
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:26,247
We'll soon get officially married.

140
00:18:26,479 --> 00:18:29,098
Must be really something, this lady?

141
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:33,610
Following you couldn't
have been an easy decision.

142
00:18:33,997 --> 00:18:36,001
You'll make it happen, won't you?

143
00:18:36,564 --> 00:18:39,538
I felt uncomfortable sending you alone,

144
00:18:39,672 --> 00:18:44,713
but with someone by your side,
a big weight is off my shoulders.

145
00:18:45,007 --> 00:18:46,378
Thanks, Hyung.

146
00:18:46,476 --> 00:18:48,960
But, where is she?

147
00:18:49,107 --> 00:18:52,387
She'll be back in a moment.
Why don't you meet her before you go?

148
00:18:54,638 --> 00:18:58,224
I certainly would like to,
but I need to go.

149
00:19:00,099 --> 00:19:04,564
You're leaving the day after tomorrow,
here's the password and instructions.

150
00:19:07,184 --> 00:19:09,521
I'll meet her then.

151
00:19:16,794 --> 00:19:20,062
What's wrong with your hand?

152
00:19:21,653 --> 00:19:23,011
It's nothing.

153
00:19:23,146 --> 00:19:25,423
I hurt myself at work.

154
00:19:25,692 --> 00:19:29,976
But, isn't Jeongyeon a little too late?

155
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:32,987
You know, about that...

156
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:35,912
I sent Jeongyeon on a business trip.

157
00:19:35,973 --> 00:19:37,797
What is that supposed to mean?

158
00:19:37,956 --> 00:19:41,959
You invite both families to lunch,
and the protagonist is missing?

159
00:19:42,093 --> 00:19:44,982
Something urgent came up at work, 
so it couldn't be helped.

160
00:19:45,312 --> 00:19:46,695
I apologize, Chairman.

161
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,800
I should have told you in advance.

162
00:19:49,143 --> 00:19:54,994
Considering how suddenly
things change at work these days...

163
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,568
Let's just finish lunch
and get up for today.

164
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:01,738
<i>When Jeongyeon is back from her trip, 
I'll bring her home myself.</i>

165
00:20:01,873 --> 00:20:05,704
Is there any other issue 
between you two?

166
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:14,079
The only issue is that we're busy.

167
00:20:14,205 --> 00:20:16,013
That is all.

168
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:18,742
All right, then.

169
00:20:18,889 --> 00:20:23,781
Since Jeongyeon is not here,
if you're done eating, shall we get up?

170
00:20:51,367 --> 00:20:52,713
What's wrong with you?

171
00:20:52,909 --> 00:20:54,145
Someone you know?

172
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:57,144
Uh? Nah... I don't.

173
00:20:57,315 --> 00:21:01,317
I'll deal with the bill,
so you go ahead first.

174
00:21:16,355 --> 00:21:20,638
- Your wife?
- She went ahead first.

175
00:21:21,568 --> 00:21:26,068
What do I owe this unexpected visit to?

176
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:32,697
Did you sell out your daughter?

177
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,440
What's that supposed to mean?

178
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:39,479
Was Jeongyeon's marriage
just a strategic pact?

179
00:21:40,398 --> 00:21:41,792
I didn't push for that.

180
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:44,068
Don't lie to me!

181
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:48,732
Don't you remember 
how you abandoned me,

182
00:21:48,793 --> 00:21:52,673
just because your wife's parents
funded your business venture?

183
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:57,581
You're the kind of man who would
do anything for the sake of success.

184
00:21:57,694 --> 00:21:58,658
Look, Gyeongok...

185
00:21:58,719 --> 00:22:01,253
I don't want to hear you call my name!

186
00:22:06,808 --> 00:22:08,746
I'm sorry.

187
00:22:10,019 --> 00:22:15,111
- Back then, I...
- All this time for me has felt like hell.

188
00:22:17,212 --> 00:22:22,208
But the reason I decided to endure it 
all was merely for my daughter's sake.

189
00:22:22,538 --> 00:22:26,271
To make sure she would never
have to go through the same thing!

190
00:22:26,968 --> 00:22:28,486
But...

191
00:22:29,834 --> 00:22:31,613
But now you...

192
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:33,909
Jeongyeon is my daughter.

193
00:22:34,129 --> 00:22:37,091
I want her to be happy just as you do.

194
00:22:37,152 --> 00:22:39,220
And you expect me to believe that?

195
00:22:39,404 --> 00:22:42,317
After forcing her into a
marriage she never wanted?

196
00:22:43,087 --> 00:22:47,199
I will not tolerate seeing her unhappy.

197
00:22:47,346 --> 00:22:50,663
- Gyeongok...
- I said don't call my name!

198
00:22:50,908 --> 00:22:54,702
Cancel her marriage and
let her do what she wants.

199
00:22:56,741 --> 00:22:59,186
It was Jeongyeon's decision.

200
00:23:00,035 --> 00:23:02,111
Don't look down on me.

201
00:23:03,401 --> 00:23:05,489
If anything ever happens to Jeongyeon,

202
00:23:05,844 --> 00:23:09,173
I'll put everything on the line
to destroy Manbo Construction.

203
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:17,910
I am powerful enough
to fight with you now.

204
00:23:18,611 --> 00:23:20,578
Think I wouldn't be able to?

205
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:25,037
Jeongyeon will soon be back.

206
00:23:25,514 --> 00:23:27,399
If you really don't want to believe me,

207
00:23:27,582 --> 00:23:32,245
go ask her what she really wants.

208
00:23:32,931 --> 00:23:37,631
I'll follow her wishes.

209
00:23:57,303 --> 00:23:58,095
Chief.

210
00:23:58,242 --> 00:24:02,061
We're in trouble because of the apartment
ads Hwang Jeongyeon was working on.

211
00:24:03,228 --> 00:24:04,239
What are you trying to say?

212
00:24:04,337 --> 00:24:07,928
The shoot is right behind the corner 
but she's nowhere to be found.

213
00:24:08,063 --> 00:24:11,257
We have a meeting with
the composer today for the song.

214
00:24:11,343 --> 00:24:14,746
Write a report on our current 
progress and bring it to me.

215
00:24:14,966 --> 00:24:16,594
Are you going to take
care of this yourself?

216
00:24:16,716 --> 00:24:19,739
Why don't you just assign
the project to someone else...

217
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:29,570
<i>Think about it.</i>

218
00:24:29,693 --> 00:24:34,028
How would Jeongyeon find Gangmo, 
when even the police can't?

219
00:24:34,648 --> 00:24:37,753
There is someone in the company 
who's in contact with him.

220
00:24:39,282 --> 00:24:40,792
And who's that?

221
00:24:41,727 --> 00:24:43,264
Yeom Shideok.

222
00:24:43,444 --> 00:24:45,149
Shideok?!

223
00:24:47,614 --> 00:24:49,389
I'm sure...

224
00:24:49,732 --> 00:24:52,130
that he'll call Shideok again.

225
00:24:53,275 --> 00:24:54,884
Jeongshik.

226
00:24:55,349 --> 00:24:57,063
You'll have to help me out.

227
00:24:57,376 --> 00:24:59,462
Should I just force it 
out of Shideok's mouth?

228
00:24:59,523 --> 00:25:02,118
No... Forget that.

229
00:25:02,657 --> 00:25:04,395
Just do as I say.

230
00:25:25,669 --> 00:25:28,027
Whenever a call is directed
to the Goods & Services office,

231
00:25:28,137 --> 00:25:30,879
this phone will ring as well.

232
00:25:32,861 --> 00:25:37,769
But you really think Jeongyeon
went looking for Gangmo?

233
00:25:37,892 --> 00:25:39,740
It's been two days already.

234
00:25:39,948 --> 00:25:44,642
That can only suggest
they spent the night toge...

235
00:25:44,716 --> 00:25:46,796
Hey... Hwang Jeongshik!

236
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:48,950
Ahh... What the hell...

237
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:50,542
Ohh... You little...

238
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:53,234
Just mention Jeongyeon,
and he catches fire.

239
00:25:53,332 --> 00:25:55,692
<i>Don't you worry.</i>

240
00:25:55,802 --> 00:25:59,975
Think there could be anything
between Jeongyeon and Gangmo?

241
00:26:02,817 --> 00:26:07,355
I'll be right back, so stick
to this phone all day. Got it?

242
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:11,156
Hey... Think I have nothing to do? 
I'm busy, man!

243
00:26:11,719 --> 00:26:14,583
Is it anything more important
than this, by any chance?

244
00:26:14,803 --> 00:26:17,740
What if Gangmo told her everything?

245
00:26:20,017 --> 00:26:23,724
All right... I get it.

But, did you come to the

252
00:26:57,846 --> 00:27:00,795
Must be really hard to get in.

253
00:27:00,893 --> 00:27:04,369
Haven't you heard about

Start.

I'll be singing
Yoon Sinae's "Passion."

Yes... Of course, sing...

like So Jiyoung will be hard.

So, what?
Want me to give up?

282

Still... A few of them 
seemed to show some potential?!

It was a silent, eerily silent night.

311
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:57,470
A young lady, standing
by the window in solitude.

312
00:30:58,541 --> 00:31:11,028
She looked at the evening sky,
a dark mantle where no star shone.

313
00:31:11,701 --> 00:31:23,267
Tears flowing down her face,
her cries vanishing in oblivion.

314
00:31:23,818 --> 00:31:37,079
Will the street lamps outside
the window see and hear her tears?

315
00:31:37,263 --> 00:31:51,233
Ghastly, feeble lights, the sole companion
giving her solace in this sad night.

The sole companion giving her 
solace in this sad night.

The only thing she could lean onto,

319
00:32:11,658 --> 00:32:18,052
Fatigued by that mantle of darkness.

I can do much better.

326
00:32:45,293 --> 00:32:47,949
So you're an amateur who never 
received any formal training.

327
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,307
Yes...

328
00:32:49,405 --> 00:32:51,400
What are you, singing at the
market downtown or something?

329
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:53,848
Going off-key and 
missing all the beats.

330
00:32:56,910 --> 00:33:00,283
Today's audition is over.
You can go.

331
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:04,371
Have a nice day.

332
00:33:04,579 --> 00:33:05,962
You...

333
00:33:07,738 --> 00:33:09,915
You're cleaning this place 
starting tomorrow.

334
00:33:10,098 --> 00:33:10,723
What?

335
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,975
Come and clean this place.

336
00:33:13,932 --> 00:33:15,582
Yes...

337
00:33:24,894 --> 00:33:26,377
Park Seonsaengnim.

338
00:33:26,707 --> 00:33:31,597
I thought I made it clear that I
wouldn't do any song for commercials?!

339
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:34,302
And I'm sure you know that
it would breach our contract?!

340
00:33:34,889 --> 00:33:36,881
Did we sign already?

341
00:33:37,154 --> 00:33:41,722
Because of next month's rent,
they were about to kick us out, so...

342
00:33:41,918 --> 00:33:46,177
It's for the advertising campaign of
Manbo Construction's new apartments.

343
00:33:46,398 --> 00:33:51,452
Would you be able to compensate us 
for the damages incurred?

344
00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:02,728
Is it going well?

345
00:34:03,242 --> 00:34:04,143
What?

346
00:34:04,302 --> 00:34:07,837
Seemed like my father was
searching for Lee Gangmo.

347
00:34:08,583 --> 00:34:09,954
It's not working.

348
00:34:10,223 --> 00:34:12,010
Why are you asking?

349
00:34:16,588 --> 00:34:18,730
What's the matter?

350
00:34:20,688 --> 00:34:22,503
Jeongyeon...

351
00:34:24,216 --> 00:34:27,252
might be with Lee Gangmo as we speak.

352
00:34:29,869 --> 00:34:31,413
What are you saying?

353
00:34:31,572 --> 00:34:34,889
Why would your fiancee
be with Lee Gangmo?

354
00:34:35,585 --> 00:34:37,579
Those two...

355
00:34:45,456 --> 00:34:49,211
You're not telling me they...

356
00:34:49,456 --> 00:34:51,059
Anyhow, Hyung.

357
00:34:51,304 --> 00:34:56,065
If Jeongyeon is found with Gangmo,

358
00:34:56,481 --> 00:34:59,198
you must never let my father know that.

359
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:03,445
You know what I mean, right?

360
00:35:04,881 --> 00:35:08,243
Yeah. Sure.

361
00:35:09,308 --> 00:35:11,829
I've never felt this way before.

362
00:35:12,808 --> 00:35:14,950
It feels as if...

363
00:35:17,117 --> 00:35:19,897
Gangmo completely beat me.

364
00:35:27,755 --> 00:35:30,290
<i>Push harder, will you?</i>

365
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:32,901
- Like this?
- Yeah.

366
00:35:35,661 --> 00:35:40,705
The weather's so nice, do we have
to waste all day doing the laundry?

367
00:35:40,974 --> 00:35:43,588
Then, are you going to wear that 
all the way to Hong Kong?

368
00:35:43,674 --> 00:35:46,082
It's still our honeymoon, after all.

369
00:35:47,128 --> 00:35:48,778
Honeymoon?!

370
00:35:50,434 --> 00:35:52,804
I just decided to consider it as that.

371
00:35:53,037 --> 00:35:55,215
As our honeymoon trip.

372
00:35:57,613 --> 00:36:00,930
- Ohh... Sorry.
- You did it on purpose...

373
00:36:05,239 --> 00:36:06,853
You really...

374
00:36:07,257 --> 00:36:10,291
So what? I kissed my wife.

375
00:36:20,505 --> 00:36:23,308
<i>All right, don't... Stop!</i>

376
00:36:23,406 --> 00:36:25,731
Enough with that, will you?

377
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,383
<i>Hyung!</i>

378
00:36:41,863 --> 00:36:43,927
You could have come in,
what are you doing here?

379
00:36:44,025 --> 00:36:45,444
Let's go.

380
00:36:49,618 --> 00:36:51,712
Jeongyeon...

381
00:36:53,514 --> 00:36:55,873
can't come with you.

382
00:36:57,012 --> 00:37:02,006
I could only find you 
a spot on that boat.

383
00:37:02,581 --> 00:37:05,066
How did you know it was Jeongyeon?

384
00:37:08,265 --> 00:37:09,863
Did you...

385
00:37:12,874 --> 00:37:17,622
tell her about me?

386
00:37:18,062 --> 00:37:19,482
No.

387
00:37:22,001 --> 00:37:24,157
Don't ever tell her about that.

388
00:37:24,292 --> 00:37:26,691
You're hiding something
from me, aren't you?

389
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:31,928
When you helped Chairman Hong, he said 
you had a grudge against Chairman Hwang.

390
00:37:32,039 --> 00:37:33,985
- Nothing of the sort.
- No.

391
00:37:34,131 --> 00:37:35,918
You're acting strange.

392
00:37:36,322 --> 00:37:39,553
Not to mention you're trying to betray 
Jo Pilyeon despite working under him.

393
00:37:39,663 --> 00:37:40,606
What is all this, Hyung?

394
00:37:40,704 --> 00:37:42,944
What are you hiding?

395
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:46,665
What is all this grudge about?
Don't hide it and just tell me!

396
00:37:46,812 --> 00:37:48,672
Gangmo...

397
00:37:58,158 --> 00:38:00,263
Hwang Taeseop and Jo Pilyeon...

398
00:38:00,423 --> 00:38:02,601
Those two men...

399
00:38:04,731 --> 00:38:07,019
killed our father.

400
00:38:08,929 --> 00:38:09,904
What?

401
00:38:10,051 --> 00:38:14,053
They conspired to get their hands
on those smuggled gold bars,

402
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,276
and killed our father.

403
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:39,605
You're lying, right?

404
00:38:39,838 --> 00:38:41,490
Gangmo...

405
00:38:41,723 --> 00:38:44,586
If you're lying,
I'll never see you again!

406
00:38:44,684 --> 00:38:47,499
I saw it with my own eyes!

407
00:38:48,283 --> 00:38:52,737
Our poor father shedding bitter tears,
as those two bastards killed him!

408
00:38:57,143 --> 00:39:04,461
The reason I couldn't die and
stuck to Jo Pilyeon all this time...

409
00:39:05,403 --> 00:39:07,521
is exactly that.

410
00:39:09,259 --> 00:39:16,223
Bringing their downfall
with my own hands.

411
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:35,146
I'm sorry.

412
00:39:37,965 --> 00:39:41,070
I didn't want you to know this...

413
00:39:43,395 --> 00:39:45,565
I'm sorry.

414
00:40:14,827 --> 00:40:16,981
Forget that woman.

415
00:40:20,173 --> 00:40:22,158
Forget her,

416
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,863
<i>give it all up,</i>

417
00:40:25,304 --> 00:40:27,416
<i>and just go.</i>

418
00:40:29,508 --> 00:40:32,960
I'll find the right opportunity
and send you to the States.

419
00:40:34,992 --> 00:40:37,684
You'll get your American citizenship,

420
00:40:39,104 --> 00:40:41,988
<i>and then you can succeed
the way you wanted.</i>

421
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:46,345
That'll do it.

422
00:40:55,393 --> 00:40:57,341
Hyung...

423
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,221
How can you be so late?

424
00:41:30,441 --> 00:41:33,256
I thought I'd die in here, 
waiting all day.

425
00:41:33,525 --> 00:41:35,280
Still no calls?

426
00:41:35,931 --> 00:41:38,905
I think we just wasted our time.

427
00:41:39,823 --> 00:41:44,450
Listen, let's just call it 
quits and go for a drink.

428
00:42:00,388 --> 00:42:01,971
Yes?

429
00:42:04,208 --> 00:42:05,606
Hello?

430
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:07,234
<i>It's me, Shideok.</i>

431
00:42:07,332 --> 00:42:09,180
Ga...Gangmo?!

432
00:42:11,774 --> 00:42:13,109
<i>Are you all right?</i>

433
00:42:13,206 --> 00:42:15,225
<i>You're doing okay, aren't you?</i>

434
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:16,608
<i>Yeah.</i>

435
00:42:17,721 --> 00:42:20,353
<i>I'm leaving for 
Hong Kong early tomorrow.</i>

436
00:42:21,521 --> 00:42:23,082
Hong Kong?!

437
00:42:24,318 --> 00:42:25,603
How about Jeongyeon?

438
00:42:26,032 --> 00:42:28,946
She's with you, right?

439
00:42:29,876 --> 00:42:32,703
<i>It's a mess here,
with everyone looking for her.</i>

440
00:42:32,813 --> 00:42:35,102
<i>Is Jeongyeon coming with you?</i>

441
00:42:36,338 --> 00:42:38,137
<i>Hey, Lee Gangmo!</i>

442
00:42:39,959 --> 00:42:45,861
Jeongyeon will soon go back home.

443
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:51,772
Take good care of her while I'm away.

444
00:42:54,196 --> 00:42:57,557
<i>Wait... Don't hang up! Gangmo!</i>

445
00:43:08,584 --> 00:43:09,556
What did he say?

446
00:43:09,679 --> 00:43:12,347
Did you find out where he is?

447
00:43:13,962 --> 00:43:15,676
Follow me.

448
00:43:24,642 --> 00:43:26,504
You're back?

449
00:43:29,502 --> 00:43:31,620
We should have 
brought some more money.

450
00:43:31,754 --> 00:43:34,608
They said Hong Kong 
is really expensive.

451
00:43:35,498 --> 00:43:38,830
We'll just tighten our belt.

452
00:43:39,821 --> 00:43:40,605
Look.

453
00:43:40,727 --> 00:43:43,248
This is all we have.

454
00:43:43,518 --> 00:43:46,785
When we get there, we'll have
to get ourselves a place to stay,

455
00:43:46,905 --> 00:43:49,708
<i>and as for our monthly
allowance, at least...</i>

456
00:43:52,009 --> 00:43:53,147
This won't do it.

457
00:43:53,232 --> 00:43:55,191
I'll have to start again from scratch.

458
00:43:55,399 --> 00:44:00,173
It would be much better to buy 
bare necessities here, and...

459
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:08,636
Did anything happen outside?

460
00:44:09,395 --> 00:44:10,950
No.

461
00:44:11,133 --> 00:44:12,945
Nothing.

462
00:44:18,066 --> 00:44:20,759
Don't worry, Gangmo.

463
00:44:20,955 --> 00:44:23,451
Everything will go well.

464
00:44:26,228 --> 00:44:28,090
Should we go out a while?

465
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:32,814
- We need to go before they close...
- There's no need to do it today.

466
00:44:33,236 --> 00:44:34,368
Uh?

467
00:44:35,556 --> 00:44:38,101
They postponed the date.

468
00:44:39,408 --> 00:44:42,602
Then, when are we leaving?

469
00:44:43,837 --> 00:44:46,556
We have to wait another few days.

470
00:44:47,290 --> 00:44:50,154
We'll have to save some money.

471
00:44:51,404 --> 00:44:54,523
It's ramen for lunch from today, got it?

472
00:44:56,088 --> 00:44:59,736
<i>We'll have to buy some, then.</i>

473
00:45:01,536 --> 00:45:03,348
Hong Kong?

474
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:09,279
Find out any port from which
boats headed there will leave tomorrow.

475
00:45:10,246 --> 00:45:13,391
So you're suggesting Lee Gangmo
will try to smuggle himself out?

476
00:45:13,489 --> 00:45:15,814
It's absolutely reliable information.

477
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:18,629
- Detective Kim.
- Yes, Chief.

478
00:45:18,691 --> 00:45:22,630
Find out all the boats leaving
for Hong Kong tomorrow, quick.

479
00:45:33,931 --> 00:45:35,547
Sleeping?

480
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:40,295
How nasty... Already?

481
00:46:17,266 --> 00:46:19,142
Gangmo.

482
00:46:20,529 --> 00:46:22,701
Thanks.

483
00:46:25,834 --> 00:46:28,331
If it weren't for you,

484
00:46:28,967 --> 00:46:35,540
I probably would have never
learned what love means.

485
00:46:38,451 --> 00:46:45,321
Thank you for loving
someone like me, Gangmo.

486
00:47:33,647 --> 00:47:35,347
<i>I know...</i>

487
00:47:36,864 --> 00:47:40,764
<i>You did nothing wrong.</i>

488
00:47:42,702 --> 00:47:48,359
<i>I shouldn't have fallen in love 
with you to begin with.</i>

489
00:47:49,754 --> 00:47:53,279
<i>I won't look for you again.</i>

490
00:47:55,064 --> 00:47:57,465
<i>Live happily, Jeongyeon.</i>

491
00:48:54,147 --> 00:48:56,359
Gangmo...

492
00:49:02,173 --> 00:49:04,437
Gangmo.

493
00:49:12,176 --> 00:49:14,295
Gangmo...

494
00:49:31,209 --> 00:49:33,546
Seonbaenim, look.

495
00:49:47,698 --> 00:49:52,756
Do you know where the... lighthouse is?

496
00:49:53,404 --> 00:49:55,044
Follow me.

497
00:50:02,395 --> 00:50:04,520
Let's go.

498
00:50:19,324 --> 00:50:21,798
Seems like the police 
got a hold of this?

499
00:50:21,947 --> 00:50:22,751
Turn around!

500
00:50:22,849 --> 00:50:25,597
- What?
- Take a bypath and let's go get Gangmo!

501
00:50:36,190 --> 00:50:37,867
<i>This is a forged passport.</i>

502
00:50:37,964 --> 00:50:42,689
I only got it for you because
he insisted, so don't ever lose it.

503
00:50:45,076 --> 00:50:47,413
Hyungnim! The pigs are coming.

504
00:50:47,536 --> 00:50:49,254
Run!

505
00:50:58,261 --> 00:50:59,803
Hurry up!

506
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:04,625
<i>Come in, Gangmo!</i>

507
00:51:06,179 --> 00:51:09,606
Hurry up and come in! Gangmo!

508
00:51:10,218 --> 00:51:13,119
Seonbaenim! Seonbaenim!

509
00:51:16,166 --> 00:51:17,586
Gangmo!

510
00:51:17,684 --> 00:51:19,434
Gangmo!

511
00:51:19,752 --> 00:51:21,196
Go back, Hyung!

512
00:51:21,319 --> 00:51:23,694
It's still not too late, come!

513
00:51:23,828 --> 00:51:25,859
If we leave here together,
they'll catch you too!

514
00:51:25,957 --> 00:51:27,781
So what, should I just save myself?

515
00:51:27,928 --> 00:51:30,500
- Hyung!!
- Do what I say!

516
00:51:35,957 --> 00:51:37,625
Arrest me.

517
00:51:38,168 --> 00:51:38,743
What?!

518
00:51:38,817 --> 00:51:39,955
Do it!

519
00:51:40,065 --> 00:51:41,118
No way.

520
00:51:41,277 --> 00:51:42,084
I can't.

521
00:51:42,219 --> 00:51:43,480
Wake up, Hyung!

522
00:51:43,553 --> 00:51:45,646
If they catch us here, it's over!

523
00:51:45,719 --> 00:51:48,106
Gangmo!

524
00:52:00,494 --> 00:52:02,844
I beg you, Hyung...

525
00:52:27,618 --> 00:52:30,274
<i>We've located Lee Gangmo.</i>

526
00:52:47,850 --> 00:52:49,105
Gangmo...

527
00:52:49,397 --> 00:52:50,784
Do it, Hyung.

528
00:52:53,903 --> 00:52:55,227
Hyung...

529
00:52:55,727 --> 00:52:57,835
<i>I beg you.</i>

530
00:52:59,137 --> 00:53:00,788
<i>Hyung...</i>

531
00:53:29,319 --> 00:53:31,149
Don't shoot! Don't!

532
00:53:31,205 --> 00:53:32,668
Don't shoot.

533
00:53:33,658 --> 00:53:36,620
We're from the Inspection Department.

534
00:53:48,003 --> 00:53:49,295
What happened here?

535
00:53:50,264 --> 00:53:54,544
We had long been 
investigating Lee Gangmo.

536
00:53:55,128 --> 00:53:57,091
<i>I see we were one step too late.</i>

537
00:53:58,081 --> 00:54:01,689
Let's go.
Director Jo is waiting.

538
00:54:16,169 --> 00:54:17,594
<i>Gangmo!</i>

539
00:54:18,389 --> 00:54:19,829
Gangmo... Wait...

540
00:54:19,895 --> 00:54:22,818
Wait... Gangmo! Gangmo...

541
00:54:23,048 --> 00:54:26,265
<i>Move... Out of the way...
Gangmo...</i>

542
00:54:28,322 --> 00:54:30,973
Let go. Let go!

543
00:54:31,264 --> 00:54:33,000
Gangmo... Gangmo!

544
00:54:33,094 --> 00:54:35,075
No...

545
00:54:36,104 --> 00:54:37,802
<i>Gangmo...</i>

546
00:54:39,736 --> 00:54:41,519
Let go!

547
00:54:41,915 --> 00:54:44,057
Gangmo!

548
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:46,784
<i>Gangmo!</i>

549
00:54:46,906 --> 00:54:49,538
Move! Gangmo...

550
00:54:53,048 --> 00:54:54,096
<i>Gangmo.</i>

551
00:54:54,143 --> 00:54:57,228
Gangmo! Gangmo...

552
00:54:57,936 --> 00:54:58,860
Gangmo...

553
00:54:58,888 --> 00:55:00,926
Ajeosshi. Wait a moment.

554
00:55:00,973 --> 00:55:02,973
<i>Gangmo...</i>

555
00:55:03,228 --> 00:55:05,162
Gangmo...

556
00:55:05,794 --> 00:55:07,181
Gangmo...

557
00:55:07,247 --> 00:55:09,549
Gangmo, look at me!

558
00:55:09,662 --> 00:55:10,926
Gangmo!

559
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:12,860
Gangmo!

560
00:55:27,681 --> 00:55:29,360
Gangmo...

561
00:55:32,934 --> 00:55:35,512
Gangmo...

562
00:55:39,495 --> 00:55:41,248
Gangmo...

563
00:56:40,090 --> 00:56:41,675
Follow after Gangmo.

564
00:56:41,797 --> 00:56:43,014
I'm taking you home.

565
00:56:43,137 --> 00:56:44,250
Follow him!

566
00:56:44,297 --> 00:56:46,184
Let's go after Gangmo right now!

567
00:56:46,297 --> 00:56:47,175
Hwang Jeongyeon!

568
00:56:47,269 --> 00:56:49,024
<i>Hurry up.</i>

569
00:56:49,307 --> 00:56:50,875
Let's go to Gangmo.

570
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:53,951
I must go and prove he's innocent.

571
00:56:54,102 --> 00:56:56,988
<i>Let's hurry up...</i>

572
00:57:01,187 --> 00:57:03,800
<i>What now...</i>

573
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:21,751
Come out.

574
00:57:21,921 --> 00:57:23,732
Let go... What are you doing?

575
00:57:23,836 --> 00:57:26,958
- I must go to...
- Wake up, Hwang Jeongyeon!

576
00:57:27,166 --> 00:57:32,520
Because of one man, you want to 
betray your father and brother?

577
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:40,143
Did you already know Gangmo
wasn't responsible for this?

578
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:44,643
If people learn that the chairman
was involved in this murder,

579
00:57:44,983 --> 00:57:47,068
Manbo Construction
will be ruined, you get it?

580
00:57:47,172 --> 00:57:51,492
So you knew all along, and you've
been deceiving me all this time?

581
00:57:52,281 --> 00:57:53,280
Follow me.

582
00:57:53,827 --> 00:57:54,789
Let go.

583
00:57:54,902 --> 00:57:55,751
Let go!

584
00:57:55,846 --> 00:57:58,553
Let go... Let me go!

585
00:57:58,638 --> 00:58:00,430
I must go to...

586
00:58:00,544 --> 00:58:02,496
I'm your fiance.

587
00:58:02,610 --> 00:58:04,943
I'm the man you will soon marry.

588
00:58:05,754 --> 00:58:10,169
Do you even realize
what you're doing to me?

589
00:58:11,263 --> 00:58:13,777
Shouldn't you first apologize to me?

590
00:58:13,909 --> 00:58:21,164
Is this how you treat
the man who loves you?

591
00:58:35,214 --> 00:58:37,868
Just let go of me, Minwoo.

592
00:58:38,217 --> 00:58:40,566
Let me go to Gangmo.

593
00:58:40,991 --> 00:58:42,821
<i>I'm sorry, Minwoo.</i>

594
00:58:42,963 --> 00:58:44,836
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

595
00:58:44,996 --> 00:58:46,751
I'm begging you.

596
00:58:47,024 --> 00:58:49,128
Let go of me.

597
00:58:49,430 --> 00:58:51,468
Uh? Minwoo.

598
00:58:52,204 --> 00:58:53,666
Get up.

599
00:58:54,751 --> 00:58:57,114
I don't want to see you 
kneel before me.

600
00:58:58,038 --> 00:58:59,152
<i>Get up.</i>

601
00:58:59,519 --> 00:59:01,152
I said get up!

602
00:59:01,246 --> 00:59:05,642
Wasn't leading Manbo Construction 
what you were after?

603
00:59:06,048 --> 00:59:07,899
Where did all those ambitions go?

604
00:59:08,003 --> 00:59:10,456
All that spite and fervor, 
where did it go?

605
00:59:10,729 --> 00:59:13,041
You will never understand me.

606
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:16,041
I never imagined I could love Gangmo
so much to put everything at stake.

607
00:59:16,107 --> 00:59:17,460
Shut your mouth.

608
00:59:17,555 --> 00:59:18,828
You must listen.

609
00:59:18,923 --> 00:59:21,677
Only if you do you'll
be able to give up on me.

610
00:59:21,762 --> 00:59:24,913
Shut up, don't say another word!

611
00:59:25,026 --> 00:59:26,803
We...

612
00:59:29,105 --> 00:59:31,218
got married.

613
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:37,859
Gangmo and I.

614
00:59:40,387 --> 00:59:42,708
We got married.

615
00:59:51,031 --> 00:59:53,542
What's wrong with you, Minwoo?

616
00:59:54,579 --> 00:59:57,692
I'll never give you up.

617
01:00:05,622 --> 01:00:08,414
Take just another step.

618
01:00:08,962 --> 01:00:11,751
And I'll die right under your eyes.

619
01:00:14,034 --> 01:00:16,761
Think I wouldn't have the guts?

620
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:23,449
Am I...

621
01:00:26,147 --> 01:00:28,176
Am I really...

622
01:00:29,581 --> 01:00:31,636
nothing to you?

623
01:00:34,410 --> 01:00:37,136
Do I mean so little to you...

624
01:00:37,881 --> 01:00:43,369
that you'd rather die?

625
01:00:44,146 --> 01:00:48,825
It's not because I dislike you.

626
01:00:50,359 --> 01:00:53,012
It's because I love Gangmo.

627
01:00:59,644 --> 01:01:01,889
Put it down.

628
01:01:03,402 --> 01:01:06,011
I'll do nothing to you.

629
01:02:11,121 --> 01:02:13,896
What's with that arrogant stare?

630
01:02:22,711 --> 01:02:25,041
Find out who instigated him at all cost.

631
01:02:25,145 --> 01:02:26,758
Yes, Sir.

632
01:02:27,984 --> 01:02:31,183
If you keep refusing any confession,

633
01:02:31,296 --> 01:02:33,975
then I'll gladly introduce you
to our Namsan questioning room.

634
01:02:34,088 --> 01:02:36,145
<i>- Take him away.
- Yes.</i>

635
01:02:44,775 --> 01:02:46,114
Well done.

636
01:02:46,322 --> 01:02:51,884
If it weren't for you,
we would have lost him for good.

637
01:02:59,742 --> 01:03:02,204
Aigoo... Come on in, Director Min.

638
01:03:02,931 --> 01:03:07,233
No, wait... Should I
make that "Candidate Min?"

639
01:03:07,299 --> 01:03:08,874
Have a seat.

640
01:03:10,689 --> 01:03:12,765
I've just heard the news,

641
01:03:12,849 --> 01:03:14,736
about your resignation from the KCIA.

642
01:03:14,812 --> 01:03:16,925
I feel both relieved 
and sad at the same time.

643
01:03:17,010 --> 01:03:20,888
I just felt that it would help my
preparations for the by-elections.

644
01:03:20,982 --> 01:03:22,454
It was a smart move.

645
01:03:23,004 --> 01:03:26,220
Is Director Jo aware of 
your resignation?

646
01:03:27,061 --> 01:03:29,011
He probably doesn't know yet.

647
01:03:29,115 --> 01:03:31,073
By now he'll be focused on
that Chairman Hong case,

648
01:03:31,139 --> 01:03:33,309
since they caught the culprit.

649
01:03:33,404 --> 01:03:36,205
So how did it really go with that case?

650
01:03:36,894 --> 01:03:42,770
Seems like Director Jo was convinced
the Intelligence Department was involved?

651
01:03:42,968 --> 01:03:45,864
I would never do something so rash.

652
01:03:45,958 --> 01:03:49,515
Anyhow, Jo Pilyeon will soon 
hand in his resignation, too.

653
01:03:49,666 --> 01:03:53,670
Bear in mind that this will mean 
the beginning of your battle.

654
01:03:53,839 --> 01:03:55,556
Don't you worry, Congressman.

655
01:03:55,849 --> 01:04:00,321
I'm confident I can beat
Jo Pilyeon no matter what.

656
01:04:00,405 --> 01:04:01,575
Here... Here...

657
01:04:01,643 --> 01:04:03,586
<i>Let's have a drink.</i>

658
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:12,039
<i>Hwang Taeseop and Jo Pilyeon 
killed our father.</i>

659
01:04:12,530 --> 01:04:17,236
<i>They conspired to get their hands on those 
smuggled gold bars, and killed our father.</i>

660
01:04:17,406 --> 01:04:20,255
I saw it with my own eyes!

661
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:25,365
Our poor father shedding bitter tears,
as those two bastards killed him!

662
01:04:41,614 --> 01:04:45,062
You will assign a
lawyer to Lee Gangmo?!

663
01:04:45,199 --> 01:04:46,502
Yes.

664
01:04:47,058 --> 01:04:50,313
There's no doubt that Min Honggi
is behind Lee Gangmo's actions.

665
01:04:50,473 --> 01:04:55,662
We must get him to confess 
before the elections.

666
01:04:55,803 --> 01:05:01,473
Lee Gangmo has nothing to do 
with Director Min Honggi.

667
01:05:01,974 --> 01:05:05,093
And how can you be so sure of that?

668
01:05:07,486 --> 01:05:09,873
By any chance, that account...

669
01:05:11,418 --> 01:05:15,467
I burned it to shreds.

670
01:05:18,469 --> 01:05:19,939
Look, Chairman Hwang.

671
01:05:20,033 --> 01:05:27,152
There is no more account
belonging to Hong Gipyo now.

672
01:05:27,265 --> 01:05:29,782
Don't you realize how
important that account was?

673
01:05:29,925 --> 01:05:31,520
With that in our hands,
winning the elections...

674
01:05:31,576 --> 01:05:36,114
I'll generously fund
your election campaign.

675
01:05:36,529 --> 01:05:41,936
Isn't campaign funding 
what you were after, anyway?

676
01:05:45,352 --> 01:05:49,758
Leave Gangmo alone.

677
01:05:50,249 --> 01:05:55,362
He's like a son to me.

678
01:05:56,897 --> 01:05:58,600
Fine.

679
01:05:59,562 --> 01:06:04,515
You yourself want to take the harder path
when an easier way was available,

680
01:06:04,996 --> 01:06:06,874
so be my guest.

681
01:06:27,485 --> 01:06:29,296
<i>There's nothing to worry about.</i>

682
01:06:29,523 --> 01:06:32,183
They'll think I'm questioning you.

683
01:06:34,230 --> 01:06:35,447
And Miju?

684
01:06:35,683 --> 01:06:37,975
She still doesn't know about you.

685
01:06:39,703 --> 01:06:42,962
She's in a frenzy these days,
wanting to become a singer.

686
01:06:44,339 --> 01:06:47,170
You must take good care of her.

687
01:06:48,003 --> 01:06:50,717
You worry me the most.

688
01:06:51,246 --> 01:06:56,001
I'll try to get you out 
as soon as possible.

689
01:06:56,086 --> 01:06:58,010
Don't worry about me, Hyung.

690
01:06:58,630 --> 01:07:02,733
On the contrary,
this solved a lot of headaches.

691
01:07:03,073 --> 01:07:05,950
Because now my goals
are clear and definite.

692
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:08,318
Leave revenge to me.

693
01:07:08,452 --> 01:07:10,829
There's no need
for you to get involved.

694
01:07:12,497 --> 01:07:14,433
You still don't realize.

695
01:07:15,659 --> 01:07:17,923
How our mother died,

696
01:07:18,329 --> 01:07:21,033
<i>what kind of struggles
Miju and I had to go through,</i>

697
01:07:21,395 --> 01:07:23,301
what forced me to
send away our youngest...

698
01:07:23,357 --> 01:07:25,216
You can't realize that.

699
01:07:25,631 --> 01:07:26,706
Gangmo.

700
01:07:26,801 --> 01:07:29,463
Who destroyed our family?

701
01:07:30,683 --> 01:07:33,671
Who turned me into a murderer, Hyung?

702
01:07:34,869 --> 01:07:39,564
What do you want me to do,
just sit and stare like a retard?

703
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:43,470
I just want you to live a
normal life like everyone else.

704
01:07:45,130 --> 01:07:47,329
I can't live like that.

705
01:07:48,667 --> 01:07:51,074
I'll get revenge my own way.

706
01:07:51,981 --> 01:07:53,935
And what's your way?

707
01:07:56,361 --> 01:07:58,981
Destroying Manbo Construction.

708
01:08:02,213 --> 01:08:04,287
When I'm done with them,

709
01:08:05,297 --> 01:08:07,665
they'll face a miserable,

710
01:08:08,231 --> 01:08:10,195
pitiful downfall.

711
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:21,474
