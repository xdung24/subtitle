- Episode 42 -

4
00:00:27,387 --> 00:00:29,383
Go ahead.

5
00:00:31,106 --> 00:00:35,094
Tell us what this solution of yours is.

6
00:00:39,354 --> 00:00:41,049
First,

7
00:00:42,499 --> 00:00:46,701
to welcome this tax investigation
with the utmost transparency.

8
00:00:47,008 --> 00:00:49,938
<i>We will be hit with significant taxes.</i>

9
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:53,543
However, the moment we pay them,

10
00:00:53,665 --> 00:00:56,310
we will automatically leave our
shady underworld and gain legitimacy.

11
00:00:56,468 --> 00:00:59,599
It's easy to make such careless statements 
when it's not your money, isn't it?

12
00:00:59,714 --> 00:01:05,027
The share of the GDP controlled by our 
sector is on a continued downward spiral.

13
00:01:05,174 --> 00:01:09,422
<i>Not to mention all the changes the 
market economy will soon go through.</i>

14
00:01:09,495 --> 00:01:11,774
If we don't take urgent steps
to cope with these changes,

15
00:01:11,904 --> 00:01:15,996
our sphere of influence
will continue to shrink.

16
00:01:16,097 --> 00:01:21,410
So what you're suggesting
is to turn our business legal?

17
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:25,034
Japan is already moving in this direction.

18
00:01:25,111 --> 00:01:27,142
I believe the only way we can survive...

19
00:01:27,257 --> 00:01:34,300
is by paying taxes and creating a new
business model within the law's boundaries.

20
00:01:34,426 --> 00:01:36,275
And how do you plan to
deal with all the repercussions?

21
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,512
Do you know how many
organizations are failing that way?

22
00:01:38,641 --> 00:01:42,145
Sir... There's no need
to listen to that brat.

23
00:01:42,216 --> 00:01:47,573
What this lady said is exactly
what I wanted to tell you all along.

24
00:01:50,201 --> 00:01:51,288
Sir...

25
00:01:51,367 --> 00:01:54,293
Hesitate before a grove 
filled with thorns,

26
00:01:54,451 --> 00:01:56,819
and the sun will set on you!

27
00:01:57,327 --> 00:02:00,035
Prepare to pay those taxes.

28
00:02:00,437 --> 00:02:02,692
- Sir...
- Sir!

29
00:02:19,322 --> 00:02:20,653
<i>Sir!</i>

30
00:02:20,797 --> 00:02:21,945
Sir!

31
00:02:22,046 --> 00:02:23,654
Let's escort him inside.

32
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:25,047
- Sir!
- Please, don't do this.

33
00:02:25,133 --> 00:02:28,017
Sir... Please.

34
00:02:28,184 --> 00:02:30,573
Sir... How can you just leave?

35
00:02:34,048 --> 00:02:35,657
Sir! Sir!

36
00:02:35,757 --> 00:02:37,093
<i>Please overturn your ruling.</i>

37
00:02:37,179 --> 00:02:39,046
<i>The future of our entire
organization is at stake, Sir!</i>

38
00:02:39,132 --> 00:02:40,913
Try to endure it, Sir.

39
00:02:41,157 --> 00:02:43,627
You can't show them any weakness.

40
00:02:44,844 --> 00:02:46,372
Sir!

41
00:02:47,484 --> 00:02:49,980
<i>How can you suddenly do this to us?</i>

42
00:02:54,661 --> 00:02:57,826
What?! Turn legal?

43
00:02:58,685 --> 00:03:01,070
So you want us to pay all those taxes?

44
00:03:01,156 --> 00:03:04,651
What the hell is wrong with him?

45
00:03:04,723 --> 00:03:06,349
Don't ask me...

46
00:03:06,498 --> 00:03:08,925
Ahh... Really...

47
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:32,301
You really don't want
to go to the hospital?

48
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:34,326
I'm fine.

49
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:36,839
You can go now.

50
00:03:56,905 --> 00:03:59,188
I'll prepare your bed.

51
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:01,296
Gyeongok...

52
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:06,889
About Jeongyeon.

53
00:04:07,246 --> 00:04:13,567
She has shown much more disposition 
than I ever believed.

54
00:04:16,094 --> 00:04:21,661
Turning this business into a
legitimate credit institution...

55
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:25,150
was also my longtime dream.

56
00:04:27,054 --> 00:04:33,881
Now that my time has come, I thought 
I finally had to give that dream up,

57
00:04:33,991 --> 00:04:36,949
but hearing Jeongyeon say those words,

58
00:04:37,064 --> 00:04:41,314
you can't imagine how happy I felt.

59
00:04:49,902 --> 00:04:52,713
<i>That kiddo, really...</i>

60
00:04:54,062 --> 00:04:57,429
<i>And whose idea was that?</i>

61
00:04:57,753 --> 00:04:59,189
Was it Baekpa's?

62
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,243
It was Hwang Jeongyeon who suggested it.

63
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:03,196
Hwang Jeongyeon?!

64
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:06,068
Sure sounds like her.

65
00:05:06,484 --> 00:05:10,327
So, what, did all the members agree 
to take her up on those suggestions?

66
00:05:10,442 --> 00:05:13,052
It looks like Baekpa
made the final decision for them.

67
00:05:13,904 --> 00:05:16,542
Taxes is not what I was going after.

68
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:20,433
How could we let Hwang Jeongyeon 
hold us back this way?

69
00:05:20,909 --> 00:05:24,542
If you want me to,
I could get rid of her.

70
00:05:27,316 --> 00:05:29,501
Get rid of Hwang Jeongyeon?

71
00:05:29,719 --> 00:05:31,066
Look...

72
00:05:31,347 --> 00:05:34,556
Think everyone uses your seedy methods?

73
00:05:35,151 --> 00:05:37,801
If the need should arise, 
I certainly wouldn't refuse your help.

74
00:05:38,282 --> 00:05:39,438
Dad...

75
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:43,185
However, that is not the issue now.

76
00:05:43,717 --> 00:05:45,414
How did the members react?

77
00:05:45,518 --> 00:05:47,436
It felt like stirring 
a hornet's nest, as you can imagine.

78
00:05:47,623 --> 00:05:49,461
A hornet's nest?

79
00:05:49,886 --> 00:05:54,056
Maybe that could be the very
solution to all our problems.

80
00:06:03,993 --> 00:06:10,269
Thank you... It's Cha Soojeong, 
give this a listen.

81
00:06:10,355 --> 00:06:14,864
Thank you... Eonni, spread the word.
Thank you! Cha Soojeong!

82
00:06:22,502 --> 00:06:24,670
Thank you... Thank you.

83
00:06:36,971 --> 00:06:38,637
Here you are.

84
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,270
You bought another?!

85
00:06:44,008 --> 00:06:46,453
I lost the other one.

86
00:06:46,841 --> 00:06:48,478
I see...

87
00:06:48,823 --> 00:06:53,880
I hear that people are requesting
her song on the radio all the time.

88
00:06:53,972 --> 00:06:55,443
Really?

89
00:06:55,888 --> 00:06:59,033
<i>She's determined, like few others.</i>

90
00:06:59,234 --> 00:07:01,061
<i>Let's get going.</i>

91
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:10,666
We're back.

92
00:07:10,776 --> 00:07:12,662
We're back...

93
00:07:12,754 --> 00:07:14,439
What's that?

94
00:07:14,533 --> 00:07:15,292
Open it.

95
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:16,735
It's for you, Soojeong.

96
00:07:16,881 --> 00:07:18,690
For me?!

97
00:07:21,806 --> 00:07:23,707
What is this?

98
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,529
Wow... Supplements?!

99
00:07:26,674 --> 00:07:28,455
American-made.

100
00:07:29,891 --> 00:07:31,523
There's even a card.

101
00:07:31,672 --> 00:07:33,643
Read it.

102
00:07:35,854 --> 00:07:38,948
"You always have my support."

103
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:40,679
Who could have sent it?

104
00:07:40,804 --> 00:07:43,862
Why, isn't it written there?

105
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,323
No.

106
00:07:46,825 --> 00:07:50,398
I don't know who it is, 
but looks like we have your first fan.

107
00:07:50,485 --> 00:07:53,184
Aigoo... Feels so good, Cha Soojeong!

108
00:07:53,768 --> 00:07:55,611
Soojeong, congrats.

109
00:07:55,884 --> 00:07:58,089
How nice...

110
00:08:00,163 --> 00:08:02,565
You're back, Director?

111
00:08:03,782 --> 00:08:05,209
What's that?

112
00:08:05,798 --> 00:08:09,848
Yes... A fan sent them, Director.

113
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:12,031
These days, her popularity is just...

114
00:08:12,102 --> 00:08:14,055
No need to get excited.

115
00:08:15,075 --> 00:08:17,272
She still has a long way to go.

116
00:08:18,745 --> 00:08:23,017
Stop everything else starting today, 
and focus on practicing.

117
00:08:23,266 --> 00:08:26,153
You want me to stop 
selling albums on the street?

118
00:08:26,282 --> 00:08:28,531
The month is still not up...

119
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:30,858
You have a few TV appearances.

120
00:08:31,097 --> 00:08:32,409
What?

121
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:35,209
There isn't much time left.

122
00:08:35,482 --> 00:08:39,055
It's live, so you need to be prepared.

123
00:08:44,297 --> 00:08:47,427
Think of this as your best, 
and very last chance.

124
00:08:48,413 --> 00:08:51,333
It's not only live, but also your debut.

125
00:08:51,706 --> 00:08:56,372
Bear in mind that it could make
but also break any newcomer.

126
00:09:03,983 --> 00:09:06,229
Soojeong, congrats!

127
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:08,946
Congratulations!

128
00:09:09,038 --> 00:09:10,896
Thank you...

129
00:10:22,693 --> 00:10:25,008
Go inside and meet her.

130
00:10:26,872 --> 00:10:28,611
Let's just go.

131
00:10:28,796 --> 00:10:30,282
Why, what's wrong?

132
00:10:30,462 --> 00:10:32,846
You wanted to meet her so bad.

133
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:35,532
Miju...

134
00:10:37,284 --> 00:10:39,912
had been avoiding us all this time.

135
00:10:40,922 --> 00:10:47,509
I tried to deny 
any worst-case scenarios...

136
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:54,086
But I'll have to check first.

137
00:11:05,546 --> 00:11:07,973
- Thank you for today.
- Ohh... Good night.

138
00:11:08,045 --> 00:11:10,989
- Yes.
- Good job today.

139
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:36,441
Wooju, Mommy said 
she'd be late tonight.

140
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,943
Let's just go to sleep.

141
00:11:38,032 --> 00:11:38,664
Uh?

142
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:40,560
I'm not sleepy.

143
00:11:40,656 --> 00:11:42,479
Yeah, right.

144
00:11:42,642 --> 00:11:45,333
You can barely keep your eyes open.

145
00:11:47,036 --> 00:11:49,332
Looks like Mommy is here!

146
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:51,459
<i>I'm back.</i>

147
00:11:51,605 --> 00:11:54,995
Wooju, you're still up?

148
00:11:55,856 --> 00:11:59,625
G... N... D...

149
00:11:59,722 --> 00:12:03,180
L... M...

150
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:06,119
Are you studying?

151
00:12:06,222 --> 00:12:07,991
He said he learned
those at the kindergarten.

152
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,296
He stayed up this late
to brag about it with you.

153
00:12:11,469 --> 00:12:14,987
Aigoo, what a good boy.

154
00:12:17,572 --> 00:12:18,477
What is it?

155
00:12:18,592 --> 00:12:20,717
Did Mommy do anything wrong?

156
00:12:20,856 --> 00:12:22,067
Miju...

157
00:12:22,244 --> 00:12:23,905
This.

158
00:12:24,853 --> 00:12:25,686
You're the best!

159
00:12:25,847 --> 00:12:27,440
My Wooju is the best.

160
00:12:27,552 --> 00:12:29,329
Mommy is the best, too.

161
00:12:29,473 --> 00:12:31,914
Aww... My pretty boy.

162
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,996
How cute can my baby be?

163
00:12:34,312 --> 00:12:36,409
I'm not a baby.

164
00:12:36,567 --> 00:12:38,146
I'm all grown up now.

165
00:12:38,296 --> 00:12:38,979
What?

166
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,903
All grown up?

167
00:12:41,478 --> 00:12:43,398
Where did he learn that?

168
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:44,937
Tell me about it?!

169
00:12:45,009 --> 00:12:47,077
So cute...

170
00:12:57,186 --> 00:12:59,279
Let's just call it a night.

171
00:12:59,762 --> 00:13:03,415
I'll have to come alone 
early in the morning.

172
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:19,105
That's great.

173
00:13:19,406 --> 00:13:20,455
You'll come, right?

174
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,695
Of course I will.

175
00:13:23,442 --> 00:13:27,077
But why three tickets?

176
00:13:27,247 --> 00:13:29,775
Who are the other two for?

177
00:13:32,598 --> 00:13:34,893
Want to invite your brothers?

178
00:13:35,226 --> 00:13:37,523
Yes... I'd like to.

179
00:13:37,748 --> 00:13:38,902
Right.

180
00:13:39,029 --> 00:13:41,846
It's a good idea, Miju.

181
00:13:48,975 --> 00:13:51,263
Don't you worry about Wooju.

182
00:13:51,355 --> 00:13:53,504
I'll raise him as my grandson.

183
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:59,085
That's the reason I insisted on
adding him to my family registry.

184
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:03,488
Sometimes I get scary feelings.

185
00:14:04,048 --> 00:14:06,389
If Wooju finds out later on in life,

186
00:14:06,561 --> 00:14:11,544
what will he tell me?

187
00:14:13,598 --> 00:14:17,751
He's just as kind and 
warm-hearted as you are.

188
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:26,143
So he'll realize that you sacrificed
everything you had to protect your child.

189
00:14:31,068 --> 00:14:33,021
So...

190
00:14:33,252 --> 00:14:36,767
Don't even think about that,
and hang in there.

191
00:14:36,999 --> 00:14:39,079
Are we clear?

192
00:15:10,224 --> 00:15:13,795
Let's hurry up.

193
00:15:14,786 --> 00:15:22,124
"Rabbit, rabbit, where are you going?"
Careful.

194
00:15:22,224 --> 00:15:29,062
"Jumping here and there,
where are you going?"

195
00:15:29,292 --> 00:15:30,828
Aigoo!

196
00:15:44,614 --> 00:15:55,240
"Jumping here and there,
where are you going?"

197
00:15:55,513 --> 00:15:57,992
I love you, Mommy.

198
00:15:58,088 --> 00:16:00,242
See you later.

199
00:16:00,349 --> 00:16:02,380
I love you, Wooju.

200
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,654
See you later.

201
00:16:05,324 --> 00:16:08,120
Aww... My boy.

202
00:16:19,725 --> 00:16:21,688
Bye.

203
00:16:33,184 --> 00:16:34,886
<i>Give that baby up.</i>

204
00:16:34,965 --> 00:16:36,853
Give what up?

205
00:16:36,949 --> 00:16:38,505
Please, Miju...

206
00:16:38,601 --> 00:16:39,675
I trust Minwoo.

207
00:16:39,776 --> 00:16:42,191
He will solve everything...
He's more than capable of that!

208
00:16:42,281 --> 00:16:44,717
It's nothing that Minwoo can solve!

209
00:16:44,808 --> 00:16:46,512
If he learns I'm pregnant, Father...

210
00:16:46,587 --> 00:16:48,449
<i>Don't ever call him that!</i>

211
00:16:49,129 --> 00:16:51,062
Never, ever call that
bastard "Father" again.

212
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,702
What's wrong with you two?

213
00:16:52,795 --> 00:16:54,405
Why can't we be together?

214
00:16:54,512 --> 00:16:56,347
Because our father!

215
00:16:57,697 --> 00:16:59,991
Was killed by Jo Pilyeon.

216
00:17:00,813 --> 00:17:02,232
What?

217
00:17:04,228 --> 00:17:06,799
What did you just say?

218
00:17:42,684 --> 00:17:44,839
Miju...

219
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:20,323
<i>President.</i>

220
00:18:21,328 --> 00:18:22,646
This is serious.

221
00:18:22,739 --> 00:18:24,157
There was another boiler accident.

222
00:18:24,237 --> 00:18:25,129
Again?!

223
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,885
Were there any casualties?

224
00:18:27,345 --> 00:18:29,614
I... guess it was casual, yeah.

225
00:18:29,743 --> 00:18:32,785
Anyhow, Directors Park and Nam 
are at the hospital,

226
00:18:32,864 --> 00:18:34,353
so get going.

227
00:18:34,482 --> 00:18:36,191
The... hospital?!

228
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:38,610
Someone got hurt, all right.

229
00:18:42,432 --> 00:18:46,262
It's a ventilation problem,
what's with all the damned cameras?

230
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:47,999
<i>There have been a few cases 
already this month.</i>

231
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:49,874
We examined those cases personally,

232
00:18:49,967 --> 00:18:51,824
and there were no defects!

233
00:18:51,917 --> 00:18:53,742
<i>So let us meet the victim, at least!</i>

234
00:18:53,835 --> 00:18:57,074
Haven't you heard what the doctor said?

235
00:18:58,927 --> 00:19:01,870
I told you to get 
that camera out of the way...

236
00:19:01,985 --> 00:19:04,714
<i>Hello, everyone.</i>

237
00:19:06,595 --> 00:19:08,304
I just acquired Beaute Boilers.

238
00:19:08,457 --> 00:19:10,829
I'm President Lee Gangmo
of Hangang Construction.

239
00:19:10,973 --> 00:19:12,338
Ahh, is that so?

240
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:14,052
Then, let me just ask you this.

241
00:19:14,145 --> 00:19:16,162
There are no problems whatsoever in Europe,

242
00:19:16,252 --> 00:19:18,426
so why are Beaute boilers
in Korea going through so many..

243
00:19:18,498 --> 00:19:19,876
We're dealing with the same components,

244
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,039
and the same assemblage as well.

245
00:19:22,135 --> 00:19:24,915
So are you blaming the
customers for their negligence?

246
00:19:25,003 --> 00:19:27,002
We're currently examining the causes.

247
00:19:27,098 --> 00:19:28,541
Should it not turn out
to be a product defect,

248
00:19:28,641 --> 00:19:32,569
I'm sure that hurriedly reporting such
groundless accusations would hurt us both?!

249
00:19:38,188 --> 00:19:39,463
How are you?

250
00:19:39,558 --> 00:19:42,555
We brought you the president.

251
00:19:42,644 --> 00:19:44,182
Ahh... Is that so?

252
00:19:44,267 --> 00:19:45,953
How do you do?

253
00:19:46,836 --> 00:19:49,510
How is your father?

254
00:19:49,601 --> 00:19:51,755
Thankfully, he's all right.

255
00:19:52,048 --> 00:19:54,772
We'd like to examine
your apartment's boiler.

256
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,213
Should it be a product defect,

257
00:19:56,371 --> 00:19:58,460
we will generously compensate you.

258
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:09,115
Reporter Park, right?

259
00:20:09,216 --> 00:20:11,212
Did your interview go well?

260
00:20:11,327 --> 00:20:13,021
Since there were no serious injuries...

261
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:16,058
But, who are you again?

262
00:20:34,652 --> 00:20:38,145
It will air on tonight's prime-time news.

263
00:20:39,723 --> 00:20:41,206
How about the victim's side?

264
00:20:41,303 --> 00:20:46,184
We paved the way 
for their full cooperation.

265
00:20:46,414 --> 00:20:49,373
Just in case, keep in 
constant touch with that reporter.

266
00:20:49,478 --> 00:20:54,480
I've already taken care of him, 
so you needn't worry.

267
00:20:54,780 --> 00:21:00,152
We must make Lee Gangmo
dearly regret his acquisition.

268
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:03,909
Just in case he started believing 
he truly could defeat me.

269
00:21:07,398 --> 00:21:10,371
So you're suggesting that it only
comes down to customer negligence?

270
00:21:10,501 --> 00:21:12,296
That's the point, President.

271
00:21:12,546 --> 00:21:14,777
But we can't be 100 percent sure.

272
00:21:14,886 --> 00:21:16,159
Then,

273
00:21:16,415 --> 00:21:18,911
is there any possibility it might
actually be a technical defect?

274
00:21:19,023 --> 00:21:22,787
I couldn't find any defects
with the equipment at my disposal.

275
00:21:23,879 --> 00:21:26,140
If it's neither customer
negligence nor a product defect,

276
00:21:26,229 --> 00:21:27,670
what the hell is it?

277
00:21:27,773 --> 00:21:29,292
I've had it with this
already, so stop asking.

278
00:21:29,407 --> 00:21:30,771
You really...

279
00:21:30,929 --> 00:21:33,270
Who else should I ask that to,
the damned janitor?

280
00:21:33,328 --> 00:21:35,680
Hey... Why are you always
trying to stir up trouble?

281
00:21:35,809 --> 00:21:38,306
Sit... Sit. In other words,

282
00:21:38,399 --> 00:21:41,783
we don't know the cause, that's all.

283
00:21:42,386 --> 00:21:43,406
<i>Fine.</i>

284
00:21:43,516 --> 00:21:45,243
I will give you all the funding you need,

285
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:49,004
so find that cause before this
issue becomes too big to handle.

286
00:21:49,113 --> 00:21:50,140
All right, President.

287
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:53,117
Aww... After a meeting
this long, I'm starving.

288
00:21:53,246 --> 00:21:55,616
Shall we all go out for lunch?

289
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:58,459
We're going back to the factory.

290
00:22:02,051 --> 00:22:03,816
That Technical Director or whatever,

291
00:22:03,945 --> 00:22:05,611
the more we meet, the less I like him.

292
00:22:05,725 --> 00:22:10,203
Still, when it comes to the
boiler sector, he's got credibility.

293
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:12,515
But Oppa said he was so hungry...
Where did he go?

294
00:22:12,616 --> 00:22:13,693
<i>Gangmo!</i>

295
00:22:13,836 --> 00:22:15,057
Gangmo.

296
00:22:15,258 --> 00:22:16,981
Quick... Turn on the TV.

297
00:22:17,197 --> 00:22:18,762
Hangang Construction
is being mentioned on TV.

298
00:22:18,906 --> 00:22:21,878
Really?! Looks like the president
did something great again?!

299
00:22:21,993 --> 00:22:24,603
- Turn it on.
- Quick.

300
00:22:27,633 --> 00:22:29,629
<i>Just like briquette gas leaks 
so common in the 1970s,</i>

301
00:22:29,729 --> 00:22:33,183
<i>quickly dealing with these
accidents is an urgent concern.</i>

302
00:22:33,294 --> 00:22:36,849
<i>Only this month, there have already been
three accidents dealing with gas boilers,</i>

303
00:22:36,947 --> 00:22:38,911
but Hangang Construction,
which recently acquired Beaute Boilers...

304
00:22:38,997 --> 00:22:44,171
- Isn't that the reporter from earlier today?
- And when did he shoot this?!

305
00:22:44,498 --> 00:22:45,820
<i>An even bigger cause for concern...</i>

306
00:22:45,892 --> 00:22:49,898
<i>is that these boilers will be installed
in all Hangang Construction apartments...</i>

307
00:22:50,027 --> 00:22:52,928
<i>built in the Suseo area.</i>

308
00:22:56,202 --> 00:22:58,190
That felt just great!

309
00:22:58,299 --> 00:23:03,738
Facing such accidents the very
moment they acquire that company...

310
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:05,757
Aigoo... Really.

311
00:23:05,866 --> 00:23:07,535
Are you that happy?

312
00:23:07,644 --> 00:23:11,851
This is all part of the game,
you wouldn't understand the feeling.

313
00:23:12,356 --> 00:23:14,795
And while this holds Lee Gangmo back,

314
00:23:15,068 --> 00:23:18,310
we will develop a 
superior gas boiler in-house.

315
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:21,527
But wouldn't it be hard
to develop such technology?

316
00:23:21,719 --> 00:23:24,356
We're working behind the scenes to 
secretly acquire Beaute's boiler technology.

317
00:23:24,485 --> 00:23:28,090
It's only a matter of time before
their core technology is in our hands.

318
00:23:28,348 --> 00:23:33,986
So the factory Lee Gangmo acquired 
will become completely useless.

319
00:23:44,483 --> 00:23:48,145
How can a patient who looked
perfectly fine suddenly turn moribund?

320
00:23:48,259 --> 00:23:52,446
Shideok, you go meet the victim's
family and find out what happened.

321
00:23:52,618 --> 00:23:53,438
All right.

322
00:23:53,527 --> 00:23:56,639
There's a good possibility that 
all the data leaked to the press...

323
00:23:57,055 --> 00:23:59,654
about the boiler accidents
came from within the factory.

324
00:24:00,932 --> 00:24:03,902
Since there might be a mole
conspiring against us from within.

325
00:24:03,995 --> 00:24:06,163
Sotae, you discreetly dig into it.

326
00:24:06,294 --> 00:24:07,771
All right.

327
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:09,642
Then, what?

328
00:24:09,751 --> 00:24:11,491
Are you suggesting that we might be 
dealing with industrial espionage?

329
00:24:11,563 --> 00:24:15,928
That Technical Director
sure looks suspicious?!

330
00:24:16,072 --> 00:24:17,178
Hey... Hey.

331
00:24:17,293 --> 00:24:20,811
Forget about his personality,

332
00:24:21,012 --> 00:24:23,094
but he really doesn't look
like he'd be capable of that?

333
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:26,641
Anyhow, I'll find out what sorry-ass
son of a cunt was behind this.

334
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:28,508
Don't you worry.

335
00:24:43,689 --> 00:24:45,812
He's been looking for you all morning.

336
00:24:45,916 --> 00:24:48,184
Try to convince him.

337
00:24:49,203 --> 00:24:53,759
He refuses to go to the hospital.

338
00:24:54,549 --> 00:24:56,919
<i>Gangmo, is that you?</i>

339
00:25:13,241 --> 00:25:18,152
I plan to retire 
to the temple, from now on.

340
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:23,235
I called you as I wished
you'd bring me there.

341
00:25:23,457 --> 00:25:25,976
If you prefer that over the
hospital, of course I will.

342
00:25:26,514 --> 00:25:29,537
It'll be my pleasure.

343
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:39,564
President Noh, what do you plan to do?

344
00:25:42,192 --> 00:25:46,377
Will you just pay up 
like Baekpa suggested?

345
00:25:46,549 --> 00:25:48,502
I'm not giving them a penny.

346
00:25:48,631 --> 00:25:52,781
This is all because of that brat,
Hwang Jeongyeon or whatever her name is.

347
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:58,580
What the hell is she all about,
to enjoy all that confidence?

348
00:25:59,499 --> 00:26:02,472
<i>I have very surprising news to convey.</i>

349
00:26:13,256 --> 00:26:15,783
Surprising news?

350
00:26:17,248 --> 00:26:20,795
Baekpa will soon pass away.

351
00:26:23,174 --> 00:26:25,462
What's that supposed to mean?

352
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:29,595
Is he suffering from
some kind of mortal disease?

353
00:26:29,724 --> 00:26:32,697
I will tell you 
all the details on our way.

354
00:26:32,855 --> 00:26:33,917
On our way?

355
00:26:34,127 --> 00:26:35,885
Where?

356
00:26:37,321 --> 00:26:40,135
There is someone I'd like you to meet.

357
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:54,364
I saw on the news that
there was a boiler accident?

358
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,949
It was nothing serious.

359
00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:05,797
When machines break,
they can always be fixed.

360
00:27:06,044 --> 00:27:10,105
They never betray you like people.

361
00:27:10,966 --> 00:27:17,683
If they learn of my condition,
many of those people will betray me.

362
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:22,776
It actually might have all started already.

363
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:35,072
So from what I hear, 
you are in love with Jeongyeon?

364
00:27:38,332 --> 00:27:40,127
Is it not the case?

365
00:27:40,385 --> 00:27:42,755
I was in love with her.

366
00:27:44,334 --> 00:27:47,436
There's not much difference, is there?!

367
00:27:51,133 --> 00:27:54,766
I made a very important decision.

368
00:27:55,283 --> 00:27:58,112
Is it anything you can tell me about?

369
00:27:58,241 --> 00:28:00,711
You will soon find out.

370
00:28:01,587 --> 00:28:03,669
Gangmo.

371
00:28:04,789 --> 00:28:10,126
Did you know that Gyeongok
is Jeongyeon's mother?

372
00:28:10,327 --> 00:28:12,884
Yes, I know.

373
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:21,236
The dreams I could never fulfill
are now on their shoulders.

374
00:28:21,346 --> 00:28:24,473
A huge storm is about to hit these shores.

375
00:28:24,732 --> 00:28:34,554
But leaving two women alone to tame 
this hell on earth makes me feel uneasy.

376
00:28:35,373 --> 00:28:38,272
Can you protect them for me?

377
00:28:39,332 --> 00:28:46,917
As someone who spent his life
answering favors for other people,

378
00:28:47,176 --> 00:28:50,550
this is the first and very
last favor I'll ever ask.

379
00:28:51,215 --> 00:28:52,676
Please, protect them.

380
00:28:52,776 --> 00:28:57,752
I will give my all to fulfill
your wishes to the very end.

381
00:28:58,729 --> 00:29:01,285
Thanks, Gangmo.

382
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:09,590
He's my lawyer.

383
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:16,268
You said you wanted to
hear about my decision?

384
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:34,972
They're here.

385
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,546
Let me introduce Congressman Jo Pilyeon.

386
00:29:43,712 --> 00:29:46,251
It's a pleasure to meet you,
I'm Noh Gapsoo.

387
00:29:46,344 --> 00:29:49,386
Pleasure is mine.
I'm Jo Pilyeon.

388
00:29:49,869 --> 00:29:52,786
I've heard a lot about you.
I'm Bang Jushik.

389
00:29:52,884 --> 00:29:54,489
Nice to meet you.

390
00:29:54,586 --> 00:29:56,188
I'm Jang Hopyeong.

391
00:29:56,297 --> 00:29:57,748
I'm Won Gushik.

392
00:29:57,842 --> 00:29:59,403
Nice to meet you.

393
00:30:07,893 --> 00:30:10,278
I'll start recording, Sir.

394
00:30:13,615 --> 00:30:17,858
I, Baekpa Choi Yeol,

395
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:24,730
will convey my testament through this tape.

396
00:30:24,945 --> 00:30:33,547
First, all the rights concerning the
business ventures I've been involved with...

397
00:30:57,384 --> 00:30:59,696
What I want to know...

398
00:31:00,277 --> 00:31:02,655
is an accurate estimate
of Baekpa's entire assets.

399
00:31:02,841 --> 00:31:06,123
That is something we are not aware of.

400
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:08,650
I'm sure that's the case.

401
00:31:30,656 --> 00:31:37,126
I've been told your combined assets
make up over half the group's total.

402
00:31:37,392 --> 00:31:39,381
<i>So all I need you to do is write
the portion of your assets...</i>

403
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:42,081
dealing with the principal
Baekpa invested in you,

404
00:31:42,239 --> 00:31:46,776
and the amount of interests
you've been paying him all this time.

405
00:31:51,099 --> 00:31:52,820
I'm sure...

406
00:31:53,366 --> 00:31:55,146
you are at least aware of that?!

407
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:57,229
However,

408
00:31:59,097 --> 00:32:01,795
our unwritten laws state that
we are not at liberty to disclose that.

409
00:32:01,924 --> 00:32:04,997
Try to understand our position.

410
00:32:05,127 --> 00:32:07,338
If you refuse to cooperate,

411
00:32:08,571 --> 00:32:13,267
my target will instantly
move from Baekpa to you.

412
00:32:13,506 --> 00:32:15,035
<i>Is that what you want?</i>

413
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:18,123
What is the reason you're doing this?

414
00:32:18,247 --> 00:32:20,318
To be perfectly honest,

415
00:32:21,352 --> 00:32:26,172
I can't allow Yoo Gyeongok 
to inherit Baekpa's fortune.

416
00:32:27,063 --> 00:32:29,543
So the figures you
will write down today...

417
00:32:29,729 --> 00:32:36,363
will become a huge tax bomb
hitting her, after Baekpa's death.

418
00:32:37,656 --> 00:32:43,072
Are you telling us that
we will face no repercussions?

419
00:32:43,198 --> 00:32:46,947
If you need a pledge,
I could write it for you.

420
00:32:58,778 --> 00:33:01,332
Once he finds out in what
ballpark Baekpa's total assets are,

421
00:33:01,432 --> 00:33:06,200
Jo Pilyeon will add
a huge figure on top of it.

422
00:33:06,655 --> 00:33:11,434
So the declared figure will be 
a lot higher than it actually is.

423
00:33:12,231 --> 00:33:14,661
That's what this 
"underground economy" is all about.

424
00:33:14,819 --> 00:33:17,217
When you know neither
the source nor its flow,

425
00:33:17,404 --> 00:33:20,291
money just ends up becoming 
a succession of numbers.

426
00:33:21,781 --> 00:33:25,848
Then, disguising astronomical figures 
as a simple inheritance tax...

427
00:33:25,948 --> 00:33:27,126
will be a piece of cake.

428
00:33:27,198 --> 00:33:32,131
I'm sure he's not going to devote
all that money to the National Treasury.

429
00:33:32,548 --> 00:33:35,520
Once all the paperwork for
the revenue office is complete,

430
00:33:35,701 --> 00:33:37,976
he will start negotiations 
with Director Yoo.

431
00:33:38,148 --> 00:33:43,840
In the end, what Jo Pilyeon 
is aiming for is Baekpa's money.

432
00:33:44,424 --> 00:33:50,613
Seems like he's banking on getting at least 
half the money she'll inherit from him.

433
00:33:52,408 --> 00:33:55,581
And if things go according to his plans,

434
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:01,109
we will find even 
more obstacles in our way.

435
00:34:01,623 --> 00:34:03,461
You just wait, Hyung.

436
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:05,902
Because until the very end,

437
00:34:06,802 --> 00:34:10,411
nobody will be able to predict
who will be the last man standing.

438
00:34:31,642 --> 00:34:35,057
He's even refusing to drink now.

439
00:34:59,497 --> 00:35:02,570
Noh Gapsoo, Bang Jushik,

440
00:35:02,742 --> 00:35:04,451
Jang Hopyeong,

441
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:06,548
Won Gushik.

442
00:35:08,674 --> 00:35:10,699
Just as you expected,

443
00:35:10,971 --> 00:35:13,944
the group's top brass
has met with Jo Pilyeon.

444
00:35:21,196 --> 00:35:29,719
Seems like it's time 
for me to throw my last card.

445
00:35:39,042 --> 00:35:40,335
<i>How about it?</i>

446
00:35:40,507 --> 00:35:43,321
Might only be the estimates we made,

447
00:35:43,479 --> 00:35:46,782
but isn't Baekpa's fortune 
truly impressive?

448
00:35:46,955 --> 00:35:51,265
If she really inherits all this much,
taxes alone will be immense.

449
00:35:52,325 --> 00:35:56,038
Once Yoo Gyeongok sees that,
she'll be shocked.

450
00:35:56,162 --> 00:35:59,190
She'll feel like the
tail is wagging the dog.

451
00:35:59,295 --> 00:36:01,857
How much were you
looking for, out of this?

452
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:05,322
Half the inheritance tax.

453
00:36:05,724 --> 00:36:08,223
I wonder if Director Yoo
will comply with your requests.

454
00:36:08,352 --> 00:36:10,058
She'll be forced to,

455
00:36:10,176 --> 00:36:15,512
since sharing the pie is always better
than letting the National Treasury get it all.

456
00:36:16,603 --> 00:36:20,681
She's Baekpa's heir after all,
think she wouldn't see that far?

457
00:36:21,168 --> 00:36:22,878
It's certainly a brilliant idea,

458
00:36:23,051 --> 00:36:25,177
but I can't really say I like it.

459
00:36:25,377 --> 00:36:26,179
What?!

460
00:36:26,283 --> 00:36:29,299
At the end, isn't it just 
fraud and blackmail?

461
00:36:30,004 --> 00:36:32,306
Minwoo, you little...

462
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:36,803
Baekpa said he will reveal
his testament this evening.

463
00:36:51,087 --> 00:36:53,643
We'll get going, Sir.

464
00:37:12,793 --> 00:37:16,880
Goddess of Mercy.

465
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:41,879
All the members are starting to arrive.

466
00:37:42,612 --> 00:37:45,115
We can just relax
and wait for it to happen.

467
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:47,835
Here... Let's all have a drink.

468
00:37:55,963 --> 00:37:59,754
The moment Yoo Gyeongok
inherits all that fortune,

469
00:37:59,926 --> 00:38:03,368
Baekpa's money becomes mine.

470
00:38:10,462 --> 00:38:16,207
We will now reveal
Baekpa's recorded testament.

471
00:38:21,164 --> 00:38:24,084
<i>I, Baekpa Choi Yeol,</i>

472
00:38:24,188 --> 00:38:29,349
<i>will convey my testament 
through this tape.</i>

473
00:38:29,608 --> 00:38:35,421
<i>First, all the rights concerning the
business ventures I've been involved with...</i>

474
00:38:35,694 --> 00:38:38,939
<i>will be transferred to Yoo Gyeongok.</i>

475
00:38:39,962 --> 00:38:43,061
<i>The moment this testament is revealed,</i>

476
00:38:43,276 --> 00:38:47,196
<i>all the principal I invested 
in the organization...</i>

477
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,905
<i>will be retrieved.</i>

478
00:38:58,881 --> 00:39:00,857
Why is it taking so damn long?

479
00:39:01,001 --> 00:39:02,393
Is it still not over?

480
00:39:02,551 --> 00:39:04,605
I'll go find out.

481
00:39:12,768 --> 00:39:15,307
What are you doing here?

482
00:39:22,028 --> 00:39:25,729
Just thought you'd be curious
about Baekpa's testament.

483
00:39:25,838 --> 00:39:28,690
I see that nothing escapes you.

484
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,681
You're right.
Honestly, I am curious.

485
00:39:30,839 --> 00:39:36,482
Because of all his money. If he wasn't
so rich, I would have never cared.

486
00:39:40,641 --> 00:39:43,743
So Yoo Gyeongok will become his heir?!

487
00:39:45,854 --> 00:39:47,477
That woman's been blessed by good luck.

488
00:39:47,649 --> 00:39:52,029
Serve an old fart for a few years, 
and look what you gain.

489
00:39:52,201 --> 00:39:57,007
Baekpa's fortune will be
inherited by someone else.

490
00:40:00,037 --> 00:40:01,817
Someone else?!

491
00:40:02,104 --> 00:40:04,732
Are you telling me 
it's not Director Yoo?

492
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:07,560
And who is it?

493
00:40:07,668 --> 00:40:09,227
Is it you?

494
00:40:09,428 --> 00:40:12,065
<i>Or maybe Hwang Jeongyeon?</i>

495
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:15,938
Nah... Whomever it is,
it doesn't really matter.

496
00:40:16,043 --> 00:40:18,592
The important thing is
that inheritance anyhow.

That much money?!

How does it sound, from a
politician's point of view?

512
00:41:57,824 --> 00:42:00,571
Is it not a very respectable decision?

513
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:07,727
Sure... Remarkable.

514
00:42:07,985 --> 00:42:10,871
A remarkable decision, all right.

to convey you these words.

That he's very grateful to you for
helping him make such a good decision.

<i>Did I make myself clear?</i>

You will never take away

520

Baekpa!!

522
00:46:09,188 --> 00:46:14,975
Congressman Oh Byeongtak is quite
curious about this "secret weapon" of mine.

523
00:46:15,552 --> 00:46:19,890
It's not something that
can be revealed so carelessly.

524
00:46:21,642 --> 00:46:26,409
Congressman Oh might claim
to bear ill-will against Jo Pilyeon...

525
00:46:26,481 --> 00:46:28,908
because of what happened with Baekpa,

526
00:46:29,009 --> 00:46:34,020
but you shouldn't so easily trust
anyone in the political arena.

527
00:46:36,184 --> 00:46:40,190
<i>Not to mention this will completely 
turn the balance of power upside down.</i>

528
00:46:40,368 --> 00:46:43,106
It will amount to treason in their eyes.

529
00:46:44,972 --> 00:46:46,954
It's pretty obvious they'll
try to protect themselves.

530
00:46:47,141 --> 00:46:51,435
So you're saying that it
won't be easy to convince them.

531
00:46:51,868 --> 00:46:57,232
Build even stronger ties
with Congressman Oh.

532
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:01,741
All right, I'll do that.

533
00:47:02,803 --> 00:47:09,082
But, isn't it time you tell me, now?

534

What on earth happened
between you and Jo Pilyeon...

535
00:47:16,284 --> 00:47:17,835
As for that,

537

00:47:48,038 --> 00:47:52,325
with people asking to return
even boilers that are perfectly fine.

542
00:47:52,605 --> 00:47:54,981
Do you have any guess who it could be?

543
00:47:55,072 --> 00:47:56,975
Ahhh... After what happened,

544
00:47:57,071 --> 00:48:00,360
a single stare and 
I start suspecting people.

545
00:48:00,575 --> 00:48:04,775
Starting now, inspect every
apartment using our boilers.

546
00:48:04,868 --> 00:48:07,038
At the first sign of anything even 
remotely suspicious, bring them in.

547
00:48:07,138 --> 00:48:09,120
But that'll be no laughing matter?!

548
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:12,761
We need to prevent
any more articles like this.

549

Let's just go meet her, Hyung.

570

She even sent us invites...

You know Miju.

It's just that I'm worried!

If by any chance...

577
00:50:03,935 --> 00:50:05,047
she gave birth to Jo Minwoo's...

578
00:50:05,133 --> 00:50:07,330
I already looked into it.

579
00:50:08,206 --> 00:50:12,615
Actually, I found her a few days ago.

580
00:50:13,448 --> 00:50:15,300
I saw how busy you were with everything,

581
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:17,383
so I didn't tell you on purpose.

582
00:50:17,541 --> 00:50:19,178
So what happened to her?

583
00:50:21,915 --> 00:50:23,308
Miju...

584
00:50:24,988 --> 00:50:26,941
didn't give birth, right?

585
00:50:27,645 --> 00:50:33,518
And if she did, think I'd be here 
drinking with you now?

586
00:50:37,675 --> 00:50:40,530
Since our youngest 
is debuting as a singer,

587
00:50:40,947 --> 00:50:45,255
we must give her our blessing.

588
00:50:46,863 --> 00:50:48,428
That's right, Hyung.

589
00:50:49,736 --> 00:50:51,257
Our Miju...

590
00:50:51,329 --> 00:50:53,514
is really something.

591
00:50:53,686 --> 00:50:56,156
She fulfilled her dream all on her own.

592
00:50:56,343 --> 00:50:59,402

This is a list of the

595
00:51:20,779 --> 00:51:23,867
- Director Yoo.
- We need to pay taxes right away,

596
00:51:23,976 --> 00:51:26,769
and if you ask us to give back
the principal now, it'll only kill us.

00:51:26,863 --> 00:51:28,723
You know who asked for this.

598
00:51:28,814 --> 00:51:33,044
Anyhow, now the decision 
solely depends on you.

599
00:51:34,451 --> 00:51:36,806
I will give you a fortnight to settle this.

600
00:51:37,018 --> 00:51:40,411
After which I will begin legal litigation.

<i>Director Yoo...</i>

It's money to be spent for a noble cause,

so don't act as if you were wronged.

- Director Yoo...
- Director Yoo!

606
00:51:57,318 --> 00:52:01,789
This decision will strongly
impact their influence.

607
00:52:02,206 --> 00:52:06,094
I'd been feeling we needed to
restructure our organization for a while, too.

608
00:52:08,596 --> 00:52:12,947
Inheriting control of Baekpa's
business might increase your status,

609
00:52:13,229 --> 00:52:16,063
but it'll also bring along
plenty of newfound difficulties.

610
00:52:16,541 --> 00:52:17,604
I know.

611
00:52:17,718 --> 00:52:21,990
Your area of influence will 
also be significantly extended.

612
00:52:22,084 --> 00:52:24,410
I'm confident I can do well.

613
00:52:38,093 --> 00:52:42,210
It's as if they're hell-bent on
destroying this organization from within.

614
00:52:42,317 --> 00:52:43,664
We can't just sit
and stare while it happens.

615
00:52:43,779 --> 00:52:46,394
How about we discuss it 
with Congressman Jo?

616
00:52:46,482 --> 00:52:48,303
And how could we possibly
trust someone like him?

00:52:53,602 --> 00:52:55,124
Enter.

620
00:53:09,870 --> 00:53:14,465
I know a way to avoid
giving back Baekpa's principal.

621
00:53:16,518 --> 00:53:17,949
Let's hear it.

622
00:53:18,041 --> 00:53:20,444
Before I tell you that,

623
00:53:20,961 --> 00:53:25,082
I'd like to know, what will you give
me in return if I solve your problems?

624
00:53:25,498 --> 00:53:27,624
You set the conditions.

625
00:53:29,893 --> 00:53:33,799
I will take ten percent of the
amount each of you was supposed to pay.

626
00:53:36,029 --> 00:53:36,939
Hey...

627
00:53:37,121 --> 00:53:39,295
Do you even realize
how much that would be?

628
00:53:39,389 --> 00:53:40,682
Why?

629
00:53:41,107 --> 00:53:43,616
Are you telling me it's way
too much money for someone like me?

630
00:53:43,714 --> 00:53:46,254
- Honestly, with that much money...
- Then!

631
00:53:46,751 --> 00:53:48,701
I'll let you solve it by yourselves.

632
00:53:48,939 --> 00:53:50,340
Hey... Wait.

633
00:53:50,433 --> 00:53:52,559
Speak, what's the plan?

634
00:53:52,789 --> 00:53:56,594
Will you give me that money, or not?

635
00:53:58,519 --> 00:54:00,098
Fine.

636
00:54:00,443 --> 00:54:03,114
If you solve our problems, it's yours.

637
00:54:07,976 --> 00:54:12,428
Couldn't you just get rid of that
IOU list in Yoo Gyeongok's possession?

638
00:54:12,543 --> 00:54:14,596
Hey... Think we never thought of that?

639
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:17,296
And how do you suppose we do that?

640
00:54:17,391 --> 00:54:19,034
Hwang Jeongyeon...

641
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:22,649
is Director Yoo's daughter.

642
00:54:27,928 --> 00:54:30,125
If her daughter's life is on the line,

643
00:54:30,254 --> 00:54:35,036
it'll be convincing enough a reason
to part with that list once and for all.

644
00:54:54,476 --> 00:54:56,142
<i>All in.</i>

645
00:54:56,501 --> 00:54:58,109
Call.

646
00:54:58,626 --> 00:55:00,367
May I?

647
00:55:00,492 --> 00:55:02,816
Wait... Wait a moment.

648
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:06,725
It's a full house.

649
00:55:09,253 --> 00:55:11,168
He's out of the game.

650
00:55:11,255 --> 00:55:14,096
What's wrong with you?
Now that it was starting to get fun...

651
00:55:14,174 --> 00:55:16,763
- Come!
- Hey... Hey! Wait!

652
00:55:16,856 --> 00:55:18,190
Wait...

653
00:55:18,291 --> 00:55:19,727
- Wait... Just a moment...
- I said come!

654
00:55:19,799 --> 00:55:22,527
Don't touch that!

655
00:55:29,061 --> 00:55:31,129
You can do it, right?

656
00:55:34,016 --> 00:55:36,270
If you handle this,

657
00:55:36,530 --> 00:55:38,826
I'll give you more gambling money.

658
00:55:41,368 --> 00:55:42,999
Just do as I told you.

659
00:55:43,114 --> 00:55:44,866
Are we clear?

660
00:56:10,638 --> 00:56:13,136
<i>We have a customer, Director.</i>

661
00:56:14,817 --> 00:56:17,542
<i>Could have called me when
you had your opening party...</i>

662
00:56:17,634 --> 00:56:20,115
I at least would
have sent you a garland.

663
00:56:23,059 --> 00:56:25,629
Look at how she treats customers...

664
00:56:25,981 --> 00:56:27,545
Lend me some money, will you?

665
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:29,772
I don't deal with gamblers.

666
00:56:30,163 --> 00:56:33,139
But I have quite the collateral...

667
00:56:34,575 --> 00:56:36,931
I can help you meet your birth mother,

668
00:56:37,025 --> 00:56:38,983
how much is that worth?

669
00:56:42,875 --> 00:56:46,572
I know where your mother is.

670
00:56:46,978 --> 00:56:48,715
Want me to help you meet her?

671
00:56:49,117 --> 00:56:50,898
Get out.

672
00:56:51,343 --> 00:56:52,955
I don't believe you.

673
00:56:53,048 --> 00:56:54,434
Really?

674
00:56:54,528 --> 00:56:55,917
Too bad, then.

675
00:56:56,014 --> 00:57:01,539
You're the one who refused,
so don't regret it later.

676
00:57:02,113 --> 00:57:05,138
Didn't look like she'll last too long...

677
00:57:05,910 --> 00:57:08,107
Hey... Hwang Jeongshik...

678
00:57:11,884 --> 00:57:15,704
What is that supposed to mean?

679
00:57:17,082 --> 00:57:19,099
She won't last long?!

680
00:57:19,192 --> 00:57:20,908
Your mother...

681
00:57:21,005 --> 00:57:23,357
is at a hospital.

682
00:57:23,545 --> 00:57:26,181
Wh...What did they
say it was called again?

683
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:30,966
Anyhow, she's bad enough that
doctors can't help her anymore.

684
00:57:32,919 --> 00:57:34,542
You...

685
00:57:35,167 --> 00:57:37,409
are not just lying to me, are you?

686
00:57:37,639 --> 00:57:40,366
First, you can check for yourself.

687
00:57:40,486 --> 00:57:43,240
Then, if what I said
turns out to be right,

688
00:57:43,341 --> 00:57:45,119
lend me thirty million.

689
00:57:45,214 --> 00:57:46,873
How about it?

690
00:57:49,874 --> 00:57:52,251
I can't wait for long,

691
00:57:52,374 --> 00:57:55,119
so make up your mind.

692
00:58:01,799 --> 00:58:03,049
Eonni...

693
00:58:03,231 --> 00:58:05,447
Are you all right?

694
00:58:09,193 --> 00:58:10,727
Jina...

695
00:58:10,939 --> 00:58:13,355
Bring me a mirror.

696
00:58:38,579 --> 00:58:40,084
What's with them?

697
00:58:40,328 --> 00:58:41,877
Hey...

698
00:58:42,013 --> 00:58:46,719
You're going to meet your mother,
and still bring the stiffs along?

699
00:58:50,682 --> 00:58:51,716
Stay here.

700
00:58:51,831 --> 00:58:52,750
Director.

701
00:58:52,836 --> 00:58:55,534
I'll be right back, so just go back in.

702
00:58:55,644 --> 00:58:56,871
<i>Still...</i>

703
00:58:57,015 --> 00:58:59,427
Haven't you heard me?

704
00:59:41,174 --> 00:59:51,314
<i>But leaving two women alone to tame 
this hell on earth makes me feel uneasy.</i>

705
00:59:52,197 --> 00:59:55,033
Can you protect them for me?

706
00:59:56,187 --> 01:00:03,786
As someone who spent his life
answering favors for other people,

707
01:00:04,035 --> 01:00:07,060
this is the first and very
last favor I'll ever ask.

708
01:00:07,872 --> 01:00:10,621
Please, protect them.

709
01:00:27,322 --> 01:00:28,902
<i>Hello?</i>

710
01:00:29,246 --> 01:00:30,654
Yes... It's me.

711
01:00:30,944 --> 01:00:32,520
Is the director in?

712
01:00:32,693 --> 01:00:34,269
<i>Is it President Lee?</i>

713
01:00:34,427 --> 01:00:36,188
<i>Eonni left?!</i>

714
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:37,153
Really?

715
01:00:37,263 --> 01:00:38,525
Where did she go?

716
01:00:39,194 --> 01:00:42,526
<i>She said she was going 
to meet her birth mother.</i>

717
01:00:45,441 --> 01:00:46,949
Her birth mother?!

718
01:00:47,379 --> 01:00:48,830
When?

719
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:52,179
All right.

720
01:00:58,653 --> 01:00:59,431
<i>Yes?</i>

721
01:00:59,546 --> 01:01:00,293
Director Yoo.

722
01:01:00,350 --> 01:01:01,685
It's me, Lee Gangmo.

723
01:01:01,987 --> 01:01:04,227
Are you meeting with Jeongyeon now?

724
01:01:04,385 --> 01:01:05,923
<i>No.</i>

725
01:01:06,755 --> 01:01:09,211
<i>But, why are you asking?</i>

726
01:01:32,805 --> 01:01:33,738
So it was you?

727
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:35,344
I'm sure they treated you well enough?!

728
01:01:35,422 --> 01:01:37,466
Who did you do this for?

729
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:39,981
That's none of your business.

730
01:01:40,075 --> 01:01:44,113
Just stay here quietly, and be glad 
if you're sold to a brothel...

731
01:01:48,723 --> 01:01:51,810
I knew it the moment I saw
you punch that sandbag,

732
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:53,706
but you sure can hit?

733
01:01:53,806 --> 01:01:56,777
If you don't set me free 
right this moment,

734
01:01:57,579 --> 01:01:59,663
you will all...

735
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:04,819
You insolent little bitch...

736
01:02:11,223 --> 01:02:13,654
What are you trying to say?

737
01:02:13,764 --> 01:02:15,940
Jeongyeon went to
meet her birth mother?!

738
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:18,223
She was abducted.

739
01:02:18,439 --> 01:02:20,406
That's the only...

740
01:02:39,993 --> 01:02:41,702
Hello?

741
01:02:42,076 --> 01:02:44,143
<i>Director Yoo Gyeongok?</i>

742
01:02:45,436 --> 01:02:47,182
That'd be me.

743
01:02:47,871 --> 01:02:51,576
We have your daughter.

744
01:02:53,325 --> 01:02:55,339
Who are you people?

745
01:02:59,675 --> 01:03:01,700
<i>I asked you a question!</i>

746
01:03:02,501 --> 01:03:04,630
<i>What are you asking?</i>

747
01:03:06,741 --> 01:03:07,991
Hello?

748
01:03:08,149 --> 01:03:09,699
Hello?!

749
01:03:18,244 --> 01:03:20,375
<i>Listen well.</i>

750
01:03:26,277 --> 01:03:28,431
Whomever you are,

751
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:31,706
and whatever you're asking,

752
01:03:32,553 --> 01:03:34,763
it doesn't matter.

753
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:38,712
Because I...

754
01:03:39,516 --> 01:03:41,813
will kill you all.

755
01:03:44,039 --> 01:03:46,366
<i>You will regret abducting Jeongyeon...</i>

756
01:03:47,115 --> 01:03:49,798
even from six feet under.

757
01:03:51,770 --> 01:03:54,699
Because I'll follow you into
the pits of hell if I have to,

758
01:03:56,287 --> 01:04:01,003
and tear you apart limb from limb!
