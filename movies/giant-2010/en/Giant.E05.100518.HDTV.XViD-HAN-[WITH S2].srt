00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:20,664
If this collapses, it's all over!

6
00:00:20,958 --> 00:00:27,842
I even had to kill to get to this point!

7
00:00:28,238 --> 00:00:32,597
I'm not going to let
a natural disaster ruin me! I won't!

8
00:00:32,725 --> 00:00:36,094
I'm Hwang Taeseop!

9
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:39,621
I'm afraid of nothing!

10
00:00:40,324 --> 00:00:43,084
Ajeosshi! It's dangerous!

11
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,903
Ajeosshi!

12
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:52,713
Director!

13
00:00:53,026 --> 00:00:54,629
Ajeosshi!

14
00:00:54,998 --> 00:00:56,532
Ajeosshi!

15
00:00:57,403 --> 00:00:58,734
Ajeosshi!

16
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:02,439
Help me! Ajeosshi!

17
00:01:09,712 --> 00:01:12,476
What on earth is going on?

18
00:01:13,294 --> 00:01:15,554
What happened?!
Honey!

19
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:17,991
Dear!

20
00:01:33,629 --> 00:01:35,500
Dear. 
How are you feeling?

21
00:01:35,647 --> 00:01:38,715
- Director Hwang.
- Director.

22
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:43,434
Where am I? Uh?

23
00:01:43,596 --> 00:01:45,562
Don't you remember?

24
00:01:46,545 --> 00:01:50,509
If it weren't for him,
you would have died in that mudslide.

25
00:01:50,682 --> 00:01:53,286
And... the sand?

26
00:01:53,456 --> 00:01:55,391
What happened to all that sand?

27
00:01:55,705 --> 00:01:57,178
Uh?

28
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,185
Aigoo... Our sand!

29
00:02:01,405 --> 00:02:06,733
Honey... The doctor said that
you still haven't fully recovered.

30
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:11,665
How much is left?
Was it all wasted, and nothing is left?

31
00:02:11,856 --> 00:02:13,935
I'm sorry, Director.

32
00:02:14,282 --> 00:02:15,935
You bastards!

33
00:02:16,029 --> 00:02:17,502
- Honey...
- Dig it all back up!

34
00:02:17,634 --> 00:02:20,041
Find all the sand we lost!

35
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:24,473
- Honey, please calm down.
- Director, you must relax.

36
00:02:24,679 --> 00:02:26,813
<i>We must get that sand back!</i>

37
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:30,497
<i>We can't go on without it!</i>

38
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:38,819
<i>~ Daeryuk (Continental) Construction ~</i>

39
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:42,581
What? Hwang Taeseop was hospitalized?!

40
00:02:42,713 --> 00:02:47,674
Yes, and all the construction sand
they stocked was washed away by the rain.

41
00:02:49,662 --> 00:02:52,591
And I thought they were holding just fine...

42
00:02:53,369 --> 00:02:56,026
Block all of Manbo
Construction's cash flow,

43
00:02:56,202 --> 00:02:58,957
and also buy all their bonds and
the private loans they signed up for.

44
00:02:59,118 --> 00:03:01,487
I will, Director.

45
00:03:05,679 --> 00:03:08,057
There isn't much time left.

46
00:03:08,852 --> 00:03:12,026
Until our Daeryuk Construction
will use Gangnam as a launchpad...

47
00:03:12,188 --> 00:03:14,683
to reach the top of our trade.

48
00:03:21,596 --> 00:03:23,387
They are refusing any loans?!

49
00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:26,572
All the banks who were on amicable terms
with us and even all private lenders...

50
00:03:26,733 --> 00:03:28,436
are refusing to do any
further business with us.

51
00:03:28,553 --> 00:03:31,236
What is wrong with them?

52
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:32,396
My head...

53
00:03:32,513 --> 00:03:35,097
I really can't figure out why myself.

54
00:03:35,229 --> 00:03:37,710
I ought to...

55
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:40,254
Listen, worst comes to worst...

56
00:03:40,363 --> 00:03:42,993
Put the house and the office up for sale,

57
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:46,929
along with all the land we bought
in Gangnam under the company's name.

58
00:03:47,105 --> 00:03:50,877
Whatever it takes, you must
fill that water surface in Banpo.

59
00:03:51,068 --> 00:03:53,959
That's our only lifeline!

60
00:03:58,181 --> 00:04:01,137
Director Hong of Daeryuk
Construction is waiting outside.

61
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,413
Director Hong?!

62
00:04:03,923 --> 00:04:05,365
Wait... Wait.

63
00:04:05,658 --> 00:04:08,315
Tell him to wait just a moment.

64
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:16,285
My clothes... 
Quick, bring me my clothes. Now.

65
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:22,597
He said you may come in.

66
00:04:31,082 --> 00:04:32,406
Aigoo...

67
00:04:33,285 --> 00:04:34,518
Aigoo...

68
00:04:34,723 --> 00:04:38,760
You must be busy, what brings you here?

69
00:04:38,965 --> 00:04:41,314
The moment I heard you collapsed,

70
00:04:41,446 --> 00:04:43,589
I had to spare a moment and
visit you, no matter how busy.

71
00:04:43,765 --> 00:04:45,494
Collapsed?!

72
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:48,154
And who said I did?

73
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,777
My head...

74
00:04:49,894 --> 00:04:52,310
Why does my heart hurt so much?

75
00:04:53,021 --> 00:04:54,033
Because of the storm,

76
00:04:54,121 --> 00:04:56,426
I merely was caught by a little mudslide.

77
00:04:56,558 --> 00:05:00,235
You don't know how glad I am 
to hear it's nothing serious.

78
00:05:01,235 --> 00:05:06,085
But it seems that as a result of this
calamity, you're facing sand shortage.

79
00:05:06,822 --> 00:05:08,555
Will Manbo Construction
be able to cope with it?

80
00:05:08,687 --> 00:05:12,181
Ahh... Well, we did incur some losses,

81
00:05:12,372 --> 00:05:14,733
but it's nothing to be worried about.

82
00:05:15,929 --> 00:05:20,686
Hearing about this accident 
truly saddened me.

83
00:05:21,174 --> 00:05:23,721
Think of the kind of fierce
struggle construction companies...

84
00:05:23,882 --> 00:05:27,243
have been going through to secure sand.

85
00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:32,909
What difficulties could a major
company like yours possibly face?

86
00:05:33,114 --> 00:05:38,283
It's only the trifling little fish
like us that are bearing the grunt.

87
00:05:38,862 --> 00:05:44,137
Are we not all peers fighting
together for the same goals?

88
00:05:44,554 --> 00:05:49,662
If you're facing any difficulties,
don't hesitate to ask for help.

89
00:05:49,941 --> 00:05:51,614
I will be more than happy 
to lend you a helping hand.

90
00:05:51,746 --> 00:05:55,961
Should you need my help,
feel free to ask.

91
00:05:56,118 --> 00:06:00,394
I am more than capable of that.

92
00:06:06,525 --> 00:06:09,744
Then, take good care of yourself.

93
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,626
Aigoo... Thank you.

94
00:06:12,738 --> 00:06:15,746
I can't see you out, regrettably.

95
00:06:24,356 --> 00:06:25,655
That prick...

96
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:28,230
There must be a snake inside
that insidious prick's belly.

97
00:06:28,377 --> 00:06:32,619
He was spotted at the construction
site in Banpo, this morning.

98
00:06:32,971 --> 00:06:34,102
What?

99
00:06:34,267 --> 00:06:37,110
And why are you only telling me now?

100
00:06:37,331 --> 00:06:38,938
Shoe shine!

101
00:06:39,889 --> 00:06:41,604
Shoe shine!

102
00:06:42,499 --> 00:06:44,257
Shoe sh...

103
00:06:44,507 --> 00:06:45,809
Ajeosshi.
Let me shine your shoes.

104
00:06:45,956 --> 00:06:47,969
- No need.
- I even have socks.

105
00:06:48,145 --> 00:06:51,270
- Next time.
- See you again, then.

106
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:54,469
Shoe shine.

107
00:06:55,188 --> 00:06:57,405
Shoe shine.

108
00:07:43,401 --> 00:07:44,735
I finally caught you!

109
00:07:44,882 --> 00:07:46,188
<i>I've been noticing books
were suddenly disappearing,</i>

110
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:46,952
<i>but it was you, wasn't it?</i>

111
00:07:47,054 --> 00:07:48,640
That has nothing to do with me!

112
00:07:48,742 --> 00:07:50,276
Don't even think that excuses will work.

113
00:07:50,394 --> 00:07:51,245
Let's head to the police station.

114
00:07:51,363 --> 00:07:53,447
Thieving little scoundrels like you 
need to be taught a lesson.

115
00:07:53,535 --> 00:07:55,471
I said it wasn't me!

116
00:07:55,569 --> 00:07:58,467
I don't even go to school,
so I would have no use for this anyway.

117
00:07:58,599 --> 00:08:01,446
Would a thief study with this? 
He'd just sell it.

118
00:08:09,214 --> 00:08:10,322
Let's go to the station, then.

119
00:08:10,454 --> 00:08:12,113
<i>Let's just go, 
and if I turn out to be innocent,</i>

120
00:08:12,216 --> 00:08:15,724
you'll pay me all the money
I lost today because of you.

121
00:08:16,311 --> 00:08:17,391
What are you waiting for?

122
00:08:17,505 --> 00:08:19,232
Go ahead and let's head
to the station right now.

123
00:08:19,349 --> 00:08:21,888
You little runt...
Look at how feisty he is...

124
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:25,721
Forget it and just go, then.

125
00:08:57,107 --> 00:08:58,623
<i>Keep it.</i>

126
00:09:08,398 --> 00:09:10,145
You said you wanted this.

127
00:09:10,307 --> 00:09:11,910
<i>Here.</i>

128
00:09:13,035 --> 00:09:15,645
What are you,
boasting about being rich?

129
00:09:16,694 --> 00:09:20,173
I can feed all the guys working at 
the tent here for days with that money.

130
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:22,052
You saved my father.

131
00:09:22,213 --> 00:09:23,828
Just think of it as a
reward for your help.

132
00:09:23,945 --> 00:09:25,398
I don't need that.

133
00:09:25,604 --> 00:09:29,622
I'm too busy making money
to worry about studying.

134
00:09:29,731 --> 00:09:31,012
Really?

135
00:09:31,205 --> 00:09:33,237
Not only you're an orphan
and a shoeshine boy,

136
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:35,139
<i>but also fight every chance you get.</i>

137
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:38,969
You'll become a gangster
before you make any money.

138
00:09:39,175 --> 00:09:41,494
I only speak the truth.
Wanna bet?

139
00:09:41,641 --> 00:09:43,211
Whether you'll become a gangster or not.

140
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:45,748
You little brat...

141
00:09:46,937 --> 00:09:48,713
<i>Gangmo!</i>

142
00:09:49,513 --> 00:09:51,293
Hurry up and come.
There's a fight.

143
00:09:51,387 --> 00:09:55,112
The rags boys started asking
for protection money, and beat up...

144
00:09:56,756 --> 00:09:58,400
<i>Wait for me.</i>

145
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:16,034
There, that one is their boss.

146
00:11:14,286 --> 00:11:15,785
Good job.

147
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:17,987
Hungry, aren't you?

148
00:11:18,148 --> 00:11:19,895
<i>Let's go eat something.</i>

149
00:11:20,544 --> 00:11:23,009
<i>They'll be quiet at
least a month, after this.</i>

150
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:26,135
We made decent money by selling socks,

151
00:11:26,315 --> 00:11:28,645
so the rags boys were envious of that.

152
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,977
Go ahead first.

153
00:11:32,226 --> 00:11:33,841
We'll be waiting.

154
00:11:34,816 --> 00:11:37,085
I'll treat you to roasted buns.

155
00:12:25,904 --> 00:12:27,712
Corporal.

156
00:12:42,404 --> 00:12:43,817
How did it go?

157
00:12:43,913 --> 00:12:45,971
It was a total failure.

158
00:12:46,066 --> 00:12:48,137
They didn't show up.

159
00:12:48,742 --> 00:12:51,307
There's a spy among us.

160
00:12:51,566 --> 00:12:55,579
That's the only explanation for
everything that's been happening.

161
00:13:01,672 --> 00:13:05,375
Hampton is suspecting they
might be dealing with a spy.

162
00:13:08,174 --> 00:13:10,185
Michael just came back.

163
00:13:11,471 --> 00:13:14,426
I suspected him for his
involvement with Hampton,

164
00:13:14,603 --> 00:13:19,429
but as the kid said,
this was all a trap to lure us.

165
00:13:21,942 --> 00:13:24,525
Stop with the wiretapping
and get our bug back.

166
00:13:24,686 --> 00:13:25,670
What?

167
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:29,956
Be it Hampton or us,
all our cards are on the table now.

168
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:32,287
Now the real fight begins.

169
00:13:33,064 --> 00:13:34,988
Bring that kid who alerted us.

170
00:13:35,164 --> 00:13:36,896
Make sure nobody spots you.

171
00:13:37,101 --> 00:13:38,773
Yes, Sir.

172
00:13:55,988 --> 00:14:00,156
How did you find out
Hampton's plans were a trap?

173
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,997
I can understand a little English.

174
00:14:08,213 --> 00:14:13,259
But both the General and
Captain Michael don't know that.

175
00:14:13,434 --> 00:14:15,813
I hear you'd lost your memory,

176
00:14:16,268 --> 00:14:18,484
but it seems you 
were quite well educated.

177
00:14:18,748 --> 00:14:21,712
Do we have a name now?

178
00:14:26,928 --> 00:14:28,974
Your name.

179
00:14:30,409 --> 00:14:32,515
I don't remember.

180
00:14:33,173 --> 00:14:34,927
<i>Don't you want to find out?</i>

181
00:14:35,088 --> 00:14:39,064
There must be a family
waiting for you somewhere.

182
00:14:39,226 --> 00:14:43,321
Think of how strenuously
they must be looking for you.

183
00:14:43,996 --> 00:14:48,194
I want to find them as well.

184
00:14:48,443 --> 00:14:53,610
We're after a secret document 
about the Vietnam War.

185
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,727
Just find out where that document is.

186
00:14:56,912 --> 00:15:00,843
I'll take care of 
finding your family for you.

187
00:15:03,346 --> 00:15:05,358
All right.

188
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:11,748
Feeling this chill...
Might be a cold on the way.

189
00:15:25,516 --> 00:15:28,862
You'll soon be discharged, right?

190
00:15:30,398 --> 00:15:32,429
I'll be out in the summer.

191
00:15:32,936 --> 00:15:36,275
Then, will you become a doctor?

192
00:15:36,744 --> 00:15:38,350
Yes.

193
00:15:39,621 --> 00:15:42,043
Your future is guaranteed, then.

194
00:15:42,395 --> 00:15:47,756
So I've heard your father passed away
while rescuing fellow troops during the war?

195
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:49,990
How did you...

196
00:15:50,809 --> 00:15:52,482
He was truly a remarkable man.

197
00:15:52,714 --> 00:15:55,667
It was thanks to the sacrifice 
of men like your father...

198
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:58,338
that we can live in the Korea 
of today, don't you think?

199
00:15:59,248 --> 00:16:02,121
Your pulse and temperature 
are both normal.

200
00:16:06,506 --> 00:16:11,124
There is something you must do
for this country, like your father did.

201
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,218
What?

202
00:16:12,308 --> 00:16:16,801
I was appointed here to
fulfill a very important task.

203
00:16:16,899 --> 00:16:19,174
You'll have to help me out.

204
00:16:19,282 --> 00:16:20,832
And how can I...

205
00:16:20,979 --> 00:16:22,960
That boy Hampton brought in.

206
00:16:23,122 --> 00:16:26,744
Watch his every move
and report back to me.

207
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:30,784
If you really want to find
success after you're discharged,

208
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:34,086
you must succeed at all cost.

209
00:16:34,366 --> 00:16:36,207
Is that clear?

210
00:16:42,787 --> 00:16:47,278
All we need to do now is to record
Jo's order to steal the document.

211
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:49,222
Once we have that,

212
00:16:49,405 --> 00:16:51,973
we can arrest him immediately.

213
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:10,560
Are you back?

214
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:12,938
Yeah...

215
00:17:13,128 --> 00:17:17,502
By the way, gum is all over these...

216
00:17:19,513 --> 00:17:22,882
American-made gum
doesn't come off easily?

217
00:17:39,532 --> 00:17:41,998
It's... It's me.

218
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:43,947
Speak.

219
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,344
Good job.

220
00:17:50,443 --> 00:17:52,278
What is the matter?

221
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:54,652
The kid is carrying a recorder.

222
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,179
What?

223
00:17:56,705 --> 00:17:58,307
Right as I expected.

224
00:17:58,439 --> 00:18:00,582
He's Hampton's double agent.

225
00:18:00,773 --> 00:18:02,255
How are we going to deal with him now?

226
00:18:02,402 --> 00:18:06,776
We must catch him, and find out
where that document is being kept.

227
00:18:06,967 --> 00:18:08,229
Yes, Sir.

228
00:18:08,376 --> 00:18:15,158
So General Hampton thought that
I would fall for such a pathetic trick?

229
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:20,019
Where did all the strategic marvels 
of his Vietnam War tenure go?

230
00:18:29,995 --> 00:18:32,568
Just wait a little longer.

231
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,369
I'll avenge those who killed our father,

232
00:18:37,507 --> 00:18:41,373
and then I'll come back for you.

233
00:18:49,401 --> 00:18:52,777
<i>Think of how long we've
done business together.</i>

234
00:18:52,989 --> 00:18:54,861
<i>Help us out just this once.</i>

235
00:18:55,047 --> 00:18:57,912
<i>I'll head there myself.</i>

236
00:18:57,998 --> 00:18:58,953
President...

237
00:18:59,099 --> 00:18:59,804
Hello?

238
00:18:59,951 --> 00:19:01,404
Hel... Pres...

239
00:19:01,624 --> 00:19:06,345
What's wrong with them all?

240
00:19:06,468 --> 00:19:11,796
It's as if they all got together,
wishing for our company to go belly up.

241
00:19:12,926 --> 00:19:15,828
Hello?
Hwang Taeseop speaking.

242
00:19:16,574 --> 00:19:18,085
Yes.

243
00:19:18,995 --> 00:19:20,439
Sure.

244
00:19:20,698 --> 00:19:22,350
All right.

245
00:19:23,164 --> 00:19:25,028
Go start the car.

246
00:19:25,267 --> 00:19:26,085
Where are you going?

247
00:19:26,217 --> 00:19:30,369
There's this urgent meeting of the 
construction committee at City Hall.

248
00:19:30,516 --> 00:19:35,873
I'd need at least something
in my hands to show up and say anything.

249
00:19:37,018 --> 00:19:38,658
Hey, bring me my shoes.

250
00:19:38,769 --> 00:19:40,203
Yes.

251
00:19:41,656 --> 00:19:44,092
Here you go.

252
00:19:47,198 --> 00:19:49,077
There's a hole in your sock?

253
00:19:49,223 --> 00:19:50,427
What?

254
00:19:51,095 --> 00:19:53,406
<i>Ahh... Always this...</i>

255
00:19:53,568 --> 00:19:56,415
They still can't make decent socks?

256
00:19:56,591 --> 00:19:59,470
<i>It's not like they're free...</i>

257
00:19:59,674 --> 00:20:02,176
How can they be so weak?

258
00:20:02,323 --> 00:20:05,185
Ehh... It's so annoying.

259
00:20:05,588 --> 00:20:07,592
Director, here's a pair of new socks.

260
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:10,073
Give them to me.
I'll go change them in the car.

261
00:20:10,249 --> 00:20:11,889
It's 100 won.

262
00:20:12,019 --> 00:20:15,122
You fool. And how much were
the shoes you ruined worth?

263
00:20:15,328 --> 00:20:18,368
Still, I saved you...

264
00:20:20,273 --> 00:20:24,367
Director! Pay me for the socks!

265
00:20:29,944 --> 00:20:34,333
Even the car is trying to rile me up now?

266
00:20:34,729 --> 00:20:36,206
Director...

267
00:20:36,324 --> 00:20:38,789
If I don't get paid for the socks,
I'll lose a day's worth.

268
00:20:38,892 --> 00:20:40,521
Get out of the way, will you?

269
00:20:40,686 --> 00:20:43,178
Let's just grab a taxi.

270
00:20:43,369 --> 00:20:44,939
Director, just a moment.

271
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,361
If I help you get this out,
you'll pay for the socks.

272
00:20:47,518 --> 00:20:49,284
What are you, kidding with me?

273
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,416
You little...
I just ought to...

274
00:20:51,548 --> 00:20:54,521
I'll get your car out of there, 
so you must pay me.

275
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,602
Like that's going to work...

276
00:21:16,398 --> 00:21:19,124
Here. Give it a try.

277
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,092
It's out, it's out indeed.

278
00:21:28,268 --> 00:21:31,174
Director, you have to pay me now.

279
00:21:31,468 --> 00:21:33,640
<i>You have to pay me, Director.</i>

280
00:21:33,881 --> 00:21:35,401
What are you waiting for? Let's go.

281
00:21:35,533 --> 00:21:37,074
Director, my money.

282
00:21:37,207 --> 00:21:40,355
The money for the socks, Director! 
My money!

283
00:21:43,349 --> 00:21:47,312
If this keeps up, 
isn't Manbo Construction going bankrupt?

284
00:21:51,884 --> 00:21:53,194
Nuna.

285
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:57,062
If you fill all that land, 
will you be able to save the company?

286
00:21:57,224 --> 00:22:01,554
Why? Want to fill it yourself
so they'll pay you for the socks?

287
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:18,261
Here's a cadastral map of the lot
we recently bought in Maljukgeori.

288
00:22:21,108 --> 00:22:26,686
<i>You lead Seoul's Construction Bureau, 
so I trust you can spot a gem when you see it.</i>

289
00:22:26,832 --> 00:22:32,575
And the cream of the crop was
bought under namesake by Park Hwasang.

290
00:22:33,575 --> 00:22:37,383
You can keep that cadaster.

291
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:48,555
I must make this 
landfill construction succeed.

292
00:22:48,783 --> 00:22:53,179
And I need the help of talented
businessmen such as yourself.

293
00:22:53,369 --> 00:22:56,320
Thank you, Commissioner Han.

294
00:22:56,554 --> 00:22:59,387
- The meeting is starting.
- Yes.

295
00:23:09,224 --> 00:23:13,261
<i>{\a6}~ South Seoul Surface Water Reclamation
Construction Committee Meeting ~</i>

296
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,554
<i>We're facing great difficulties
in this landfill construction.</i>

297
00:23:13,746 --> 00:23:18,571
So, considering the situation,
the Seoul City Construction Bureau...

298
00:23:18,707 --> 00:23:24,816
decided to withdraw all companies
unable to complete their assignment.

299
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:29,675
All lots from the companies
which will be withdrawn...

300
00:23:29,879 --> 00:23:35,618
will be reassigned to other
selected companies at our discretion.

301
00:23:35,931 --> 00:23:39,209
The two companies not
present at today's meeting...

302
00:23:39,332 --> 00:23:42,017
have already notified us
of their wish to withdraw.

303
00:23:42,237 --> 00:23:48,534
The companies whose construction
rights will be withdrawn...

304
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,965
are four in total, including them.

305
00:23:51,108 --> 00:23:52,814
Shincheonji Construction.

306
00:23:52,984 --> 00:23:57,129
Your lots in Apgujeong will be
reassigned to Daeryuk Construction.

307
00:23:57,411 --> 00:23:59,669
<i>Do you have any objections?</i>

308
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:02,457
The last of the four...

309
00:24:02,689 --> 00:24:04,652
is Manbo Construction.

310
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:10,846
Daeryuk Construction will be
assigned all your lots in Banpo as well.

311
00:24:11,007 --> 00:24:14,926
I can't give my assent.

312
00:24:15,073 --> 00:24:19,726
More construction sand is
coming from Taean as we speak.

313
00:24:19,922 --> 00:24:24,850
Once that arrives, 
filling that land will be a non-issue.

314
00:24:24,999 --> 00:24:27,418
<i>Don't you all know?</i>

315
00:24:27,828 --> 00:24:34,097
But what led you to believe that we don't 
have what it takes to complete our task?

316
00:24:34,243 --> 00:24:37,282
Are you positive that
you secured enough sand?

317
00:24:37,487 --> 00:24:41,271
If you could only wait a little longer,
you'd find out by yourself!

318
00:24:41,693 --> 00:24:45,410
I'm well aware of the situation in Taean.

319
00:24:46,329 --> 00:24:48,434
There is no way there'd be any sand left.

320
00:24:48,711 --> 00:24:50,303
Look, Director Hong.

321
00:24:50,503 --> 00:24:55,732
I'm saying I can do it right now,
why do you keep arguing otherwise?

322
00:24:56,219 --> 00:25:00,365
All it would take me to find out
is a single phone call.

323
00:25:00,497 --> 00:25:02,963
A... Call?!
And who would you call?

324
00:25:03,109 --> 00:25:05,091
<i>Do it... Go ahead.</i>

325
00:25:05,311 --> 00:25:08,349
<i>{\a6}*in Chinese mythology, 
one of the divine rulers of the sea</i>

326
00:25:05,311 --> 00:25:08,349
Who are you going to call,
the Dragon King of the West Sea*?

327
00:25:08,496 --> 00:25:09,817
<i>Do it!</i>

328
00:25:09,979 --> 00:25:12,034
<i>Here... Let's all calm down.</i>

329
00:25:12,242 --> 00:25:13,987
I will give you four days.

330
00:25:14,609 --> 00:25:18,654
If you can secure enough
sand to fill the Banpo lot,

331
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:20,841
then you can continue the construction.

332
00:25:21,612 --> 00:25:24,364
If there is no progress 
after such deadline,

333
00:25:24,997 --> 00:25:28,136
we will forcibly proceed 
in accordance with our decision.

334
00:25:28,327 --> 00:25:31,819
Yes, fine with me.
I will do it.

335
00:25:32,069 --> 00:25:35,591
Even if I have to stake my life to do it,

336
00:25:35,797 --> 00:25:40,156
I will fill all that land whatever it takes!

337
00:25:47,845 --> 00:25:49,328
Listen.

338
00:25:49,969 --> 00:25:52,435
Will you keep this up?

339
00:25:52,824 --> 00:25:54,754
My dealings were done in all fairness.

340
00:25:54,915 --> 00:25:58,828
Fairness, my ass.
What are you yapping about?

341
00:25:58,952 --> 00:26:04,978
Think I don't know you brown-nosed
your way to that decision?

342
00:26:05,375 --> 00:26:06,563
Director Hwang.

343
00:26:06,681 --> 00:26:10,688
This water surface reclamation project
is a crucial stepping stone...

344
00:26:10,805 --> 00:26:13,961
which will decide our
country's future fortunes.

345
00:26:14,146 --> 00:26:16,838
If people use this great enterprise for 
their personal gains like you're doing...

346
00:26:17,029 --> 00:26:19,642
and end up compromising the entire 
project at our country's expense,

347
00:26:19,877 --> 00:26:22,739
will you be able to bear the consequences?

348
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,515
Great enterprise?!

349
00:26:24,691 --> 00:26:27,289
You bastard, I just ought to...

350
00:26:27,392 --> 00:26:31,428
If I broke a single law,
go ahead and hit me.

351
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:34,232
Aigoo...

352
00:26:34,665 --> 00:26:37,626
I'm only letting it go because of the law.

353
00:26:39,384 --> 00:26:41,540
Ever heard of business ethics?

354
00:26:41,821 --> 00:26:46,092
Being able to sacrifice
oneself for the greater good.

355
00:26:46,356 --> 00:26:50,089
That's exactly the kind of business ethics 
people in our trade should follow.

356
00:26:56,005 --> 00:26:57,675
You!

357
00:26:58,626 --> 00:27:01,550
You barked up the wrong tree!

358
00:27:01,843 --> 00:27:03,693
Remember this!

359
00:27:03,927 --> 00:27:05,718
One day you'll be on
your knees before me,

360
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,510
imploring me to save you.

361
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:17,451
Before that, 
worry about finding that sand.

362
00:27:35,265 --> 00:27:37,530
You got hold of all the loan 
certificates Manbo Construction...

363
00:27:37,732 --> 00:27:38,748
signed with private lenders, right?

364
00:27:38,895 --> 00:27:39,783
Yes, Director.

365
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:42,763
- And the drafts?
- All in our hands, as ordered.

366
00:27:42,974 --> 00:27:45,904
Act on both immediately.

367
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:48,061
Understood, Director.

368
00:27:56,425 --> 00:27:58,481
Did Manbo Construction's
director come back?

369
00:27:58,596 --> 00:28:00,675
I've heard that's gone belly up?

370
00:28:00,792 --> 00:28:02,961
Did they owe you any money?

371
00:28:03,927 --> 00:28:06,282
What are you doing?

372
00:28:06,414 --> 00:28:08,557
It's worthless anyway,
what do you think?

373
00:28:08,762 --> 00:28:10,259
- Look, the fire's dying down. Hand it to me.
- You...

374
00:28:10,435 --> 00:28:12,551
Don't even think about it.

375
00:28:12,988 --> 00:28:15,718
You better tell everyone.

376
00:28:15,924 --> 00:28:18,404
That if they lay their hands
on this book, they're dead.

377
00:28:18,537 --> 00:28:19,745
You prick...

378
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:22,045
Did she give it to you?

379
00:28:22,309 --> 00:28:25,142
The daughter of Manbo
Construction's director?

380
00:28:26,965 --> 00:28:31,911
My late mother always told me that pine
caterpillars can only eat pine needles.

381
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:36,344
<i>Think that those rich kids
consider people like us human beings?</i>

382
00:28:41,908 --> 00:28:43,483
Nuna.

383
00:28:45,152 --> 00:28:47,388
Did the director come as well?

384
00:28:47,549 --> 00:28:49,868
He asked for drinks
the moment he arrived.

385
00:28:50,132 --> 00:28:54,125
<i>I need to go to the post office 
before they close.</i>

386
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:25,969
Director.

387
00:29:26,195 --> 00:29:28,785
There is something I need to tell you.

388
00:29:30,387 --> 00:29:32,310
About that landfill by the Han River.

389
00:29:32,483 --> 00:29:34,622
I know how to fill it.

390
00:29:35,806 --> 00:29:37,278
What are you talking about?

391
00:29:37,427 --> 00:29:41,007
Aren't you having problems
because you don't have sand?

392
00:29:41,203 --> 00:29:43,267
Right...

393
00:29:44,187 --> 00:29:47,876
So what else am I going to use?

394
00:29:49,388 --> 00:29:51,207
Briquette ash.

395
00:29:52,594 --> 00:29:53,210
What?

396
00:29:53,387 --> 00:29:57,364
If you go out, you'll see it 
piled up on every alley.

397
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,769
You can use that.

398
00:29:58,878 --> 00:30:02,457
You want me to use
briquette ash to fill that land?

399
00:30:02,619 --> 00:30:05,199
Yes... Do you know how
useful briquette ash is?

400
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:06,351
You've seen it yourself, earlier on.

401
00:30:06,483 --> 00:30:09,815
After we used it,
the car got out right away.

402
00:30:09,991 --> 00:30:11,664
Get out of my face!

403
00:30:12,192 --> 00:30:13,029
You fool.

404
00:30:13,176 --> 00:30:16,684
You want to fill a place where people 
will build their houses with trash?

405
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:20,720
What's next, sticking out
your tongue at a funeral?

406
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:24,626
I... I was just trying to help you.

407
00:30:24,773 --> 00:30:27,151
Will you get the hell out or what?

408
00:30:37,013 --> 00:30:39,682
So when will you pay me for the socks?

409
00:30:40,093 --> 00:30:43,058
You little twat, bring it up again...

410
00:30:56,584 --> 00:30:58,524
Who are you?

411
00:30:58,621 --> 00:31:00,606
- Proceed.
- Yes.

412
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:05,141
<i>Look...</i>

413
00:31:05,288 --> 00:31:06,844
I asked who are you.

414
00:31:07,056 --> 00:31:08,517
We're acting on behalf of the court.

415
00:31:08,635 --> 00:31:12,554
<i>Following court orders, we will now 
seize this house and all its valuables.</i>

416
00:31:15,263 --> 00:31:17,281
What is this supposed to mean?

417
00:31:17,555 --> 00:31:19,247
- You're seizing what?!
- Mom!

418
00:31:19,394 --> 00:31:23,753
Aigoo, Honey...
What is all this about?

419
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:25,926
That is my room, don't go up.

420
00:31:26,073 --> 00:31:27,423
Move.

421
00:31:27,584 --> 00:31:28,627
Who are you people?

422
00:31:28,744 --> 00:31:31,571
Get out of my house immediately, 
or I'll call the police.

423
00:31:31,749 --> 00:31:33,500
I said move out of the way.

424
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:41,294
Director Hwang.

425
00:31:41,573 --> 00:31:42,776
It's trouble.

426
00:31:42,894 --> 00:31:45,200
Checks are starting to bounce.

427
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,505
What are you talking about?

428
00:31:47,652 --> 00:31:48,928
Checks are bouncing?!

429
00:31:49,031 --> 00:31:52,935
I'm on my way back from the bank. 
It's a total mess.

430
00:31:53,321 --> 00:31:54,775
Hello?

431
00:31:54,883 --> 00:31:55,651
Yes.

432
00:31:55,768 --> 00:31:58,410
Director, it's your wife.

433
00:32:01,603 --> 00:32:03,397
What's the matter?

434
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:08,419
Stop weeping and just talk, will you?

435
00:32:12,391 --> 00:32:14,739
Seizure?!

436
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,558
All right.

437
00:32:19,218 --> 00:32:22,146
I said I got it!

438
00:32:23,706 --> 00:32:25,310
<i>{\a6}*employee</i>

439
00:32:23,706 --> 00:32:25,310
Where did Moon Daeri* go?

440
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,086
He's at the site.

441
00:32:27,247 --> 00:32:29,610
And what did he go there for?

442
00:32:29,816 --> 00:32:33,927
Workers are protesting,
asking for their wages.

443
00:33:01,528 --> 00:33:04,642
<i>~ Go Jaechun ~</i>

444
00:33:08,812 --> 00:33:13,204
<i>Come to the Korean
support warehouse tonight.</i>

445
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:29,409
Did you find out where
they're keeping that document?

446
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,411
Yes.

447
00:34:32,095 --> 00:34:33,593
You did?!

448
00:34:33,826 --> 00:34:35,392
I did.

449
00:34:35,874 --> 00:34:37,306
I bet.

450
00:34:40,177 --> 00:34:41,753
What are you doing?

451
00:34:41,908 --> 00:34:43,733
Search him.

452
00:34:51,858 --> 00:34:57,186
Did Hampton order this? To record me 
as I order them to steal that document?

453
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:58,712
I'm not on Hampton's side!

454
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,951
What did Hampton promise you,
in exchange for betraying your country?

455
00:35:03,054 --> 00:35:06,048
Did he promise he would take you to 
the States, where you'd live in luxury?

456
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:08,676
- You can't trust me?
- Shut your mouth!

457
00:35:08,881 --> 00:35:11,907
I know what that look 
in your eyes means.

458
00:35:12,154 --> 00:35:16,537
You'd be ready to abandon your people
and this country like a worn-out shoe.

459
00:35:16,786 --> 00:35:23,685
Tossing your dead body in the
ditch would be a piece of cake.

460
00:35:27,207 --> 00:35:33,242
Your only chance to survive is
telling us where that document is.

461
00:35:37,675 --> 00:35:40,743
If you don't confess
by the count of three,

462
00:35:41,192 --> 00:35:45,939
I'll shoot each and every single one 
of your fingers right in your face.

463
00:35:49,369 --> 00:35:52,466
<i>Once I'm done with all ten fingers,</i>

464
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:58,102
then your throat will be next.

465
00:36:07,257 --> 00:36:08,504
One.

466
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:10,500
Press the button!

467
00:36:10,706 --> 00:36:12,247
Two...

468
00:36:14,434 --> 00:36:16,132
Three.

469
00:36:16,357 --> 00:36:18,956
Press that recorder's button!

470
00:36:21,164 --> 00:36:22,508
Do it.

471
00:36:22,845 --> 00:36:25,297
Press play on that recorder.

472
00:36:37,178 --> 00:36:39,334
<i>Did you keep the
document in a safe place?</i>

473
00:36:39,539 --> 00:36:40,800
<i>Don't worry, Sir.</i>

474
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:43,635
<i>He would never suspect we'd
keep such sensitive material...</i>

475
00:36:43,811 --> 00:36:46,776
<i>in the document storage
section of the war library.</i>

476
00:36:46,937 --> 00:36:51,267
<i>As the Korean proverb says, 
the darkest place is under the candlestick.</i>

477
00:36:51,399 --> 00:36:55,399
<i>Keep it there for a few days,
until we move it to the States.</i>

478
00:37:04,911 --> 00:37:06,786
Let him up.

479
00:37:24,496 --> 00:37:26,883
Don't expect any apology from me.

480
00:37:28,335 --> 00:37:33,444
Still, you've gained my trust with this.

481
00:37:33,738 --> 00:37:35,088
You have my word.

482
00:37:35,235 --> 00:37:37,980
I won't have second
thoughts about you again.

483
00:37:41,829 --> 00:37:45,740
Find a way to steal that
document from the library.

484
00:37:45,941 --> 00:37:47,941
I will not accept failure, this time.

485
00:37:48,132 --> 00:37:49,879
Yes, Sir.

486
00:38:48,937 --> 00:38:52,751
Find a way to steal that
document from the library.

487
00:38:52,883 --> 00:38:56,068
I will not accept failure, this time.

488
00:39:01,645 --> 00:39:03,602
Well done.

489
00:39:04,464 --> 00:39:06,420
What will happen now?

490
00:39:06,581 --> 00:39:10,309
Jo Pilyeon will send in his
men to steal the document.

491
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:14,894
But what we'll have there is not
the Vietnam document that they want.

492
00:39:15,116 --> 00:39:16,210
Then?!

493
00:39:16,377 --> 00:39:20,261
It's a classified blueprint 
of an American fighter plane.

494
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:22,907
Now that we have this recording,

495
00:39:23,024 --> 00:39:26,738
we can charge him for espionage.

496
00:39:47,074 --> 00:39:49,782
Keep this up and they'll kill you.

497
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:54,061
<i>Think Hampton is even
going to blink once if you die?</i>

498
00:39:54,193 --> 00:39:56,630
You'll die a miserable death.

499
00:39:56,949 --> 00:40:00,880
Why would you waste your life 
that way, at your age?

500
00:40:01,285 --> 00:40:02,882
Hyung...

501
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:06,845
From the very first moment I came here,

502
00:40:07,051 --> 00:40:11,414
I always felt as if you were 
a real brother to me.

503
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:15,040
I'm scared.

504
00:40:16,834 --> 00:40:19,336
Everything that's been happening here...

505
00:40:19,556 --> 00:40:22,918
Be it Hampton or Jo Pilyeon,
they all scare me.

506
00:40:24,136 --> 00:40:25,983
But...

507
00:40:26,702 --> 00:40:28,992
Who scares me the most...

508
00:40:30,489 --> 00:40:32,514
is you.

509
00:40:35,996 --> 00:40:38,459
You're not suffering from amnesia, are you?

510
00:40:39,486 --> 00:40:42,495
Did you pretend from the very beginning?

511
00:40:46,773 --> 00:40:48,681
What's your name?

512
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:53,891
Lee Seongmo.

513
00:40:54,537 --> 00:40:56,665
Seongmo.

514
00:40:56,974 --> 00:40:59,679
What on earth is your history with them?

515
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,086
What could have possibly 
led someone like you...

516
00:41:02,218 --> 00:41:03,862
I'm sorry, Hyung.

517
00:41:04,435 --> 00:41:06,710
I can't tell you anything right now.

518
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:08,897
Later...

519
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:11,348
One day, I'll tell you...

520
00:41:11,539 --> 00:41:13,777
all the things that I'm keeping inside.

521
00:41:14,841 --> 00:41:18,703
What did I do to grow fondness
for someone like you?

522
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:22,329
I'm sorry, Hyung.

523
00:41:23,791 --> 00:41:26,747
I hate this place.

524
00:41:26,952 --> 00:41:28,728
It makes me sick to my stomach.

525
00:41:28,875 --> 00:41:31,775
I wish I could just 
get out of here right away.

526
00:41:32,083 --> 00:41:34,211
I don't like it, either.

527
00:41:34,417 --> 00:41:36,251
Later, when you're discharged,

528
00:41:36,442 --> 00:41:37,675
let's leave together.

529
00:41:37,822 --> 00:41:39,979
Forget it, you fool!

530
00:41:45,777 --> 00:41:48,589
About what I found in my uniform...

531
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:51,348
Thank you.

532
00:41:56,221 --> 00:41:59,832
<i>~ Jo Pilyeon is suspecting you ~</i>

533
00:42:15,075 --> 00:42:16,880
That's my son.

534
00:42:18,216 --> 00:42:20,571
So you're Daesoo's eldest?!

535
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:23,257
- Look at him!
- Seongmo.

536
00:42:23,429 --> 00:42:25,811
This is Dad's friend,
who runs a business in Seoul.

537
00:42:25,928 --> 00:42:28,497
- That's me!
- How are you?

538
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:32,504
Daesoo's son can only be 
like a son to me.

539
00:42:32,688 --> 00:42:33,238
Uh?!

540
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:35,087
He sure is handsome.

541
00:42:35,248 --> 00:42:38,450
Come here. Here...

542
00:42:39,886 --> 00:42:41,612
Here you go.

543
00:42:41,753 --> 00:42:43,690
Go ahead and spend it.

544
00:42:44,888 --> 00:42:47,462
Quite a son you have!

545
00:43:12,752 --> 00:43:14,855
Dad's friend...

546
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:50,715
<i>Aigoo... My wretched luck!</i>

547
00:43:50,877 --> 00:43:57,496
<i>Meet the wrong husband
and you end up on the street!</i>

548
00:44:13,216 --> 00:44:17,102
Think of how hard it was 
to buy this house and enjoy this life!

549
00:44:17,234 --> 00:44:18,922
<i>How about my gems and mink coat...</i>

550
00:44:19,025 --> 00:44:21,358
If he only had called us a little earlier,
we would at least have been prepared.

551
00:44:21,461 --> 00:44:23,061
That rotten jerk!

552
00:44:23,149 --> 00:44:25,884
Is that the issue now?

553
00:44:30,161 --> 00:44:31,451
You dreadful little brat.

554
00:44:31,568 --> 00:44:33,417
Leave this house immediately!

555
00:44:33,564 --> 00:44:36,053
<i>The fortune-teller was right about you!</i>

556
00:44:36,177 --> 00:44:39,362
He said you would only
bring bad luck to our family,

557
00:44:39,538 --> 00:44:41,593
but despite raising you
with all our care and affection,

558
00:44:41,725 --> 00:44:44,500
<i>all you do to repay us
is steal and run away?!</i>

559
00:44:45,028 --> 00:44:46,756
Who did you raise with affection?!

560
00:44:46,906 --> 00:44:48,315
Don't you even have a conscience?

561
00:44:48,410 --> 00:44:49,148
What?

562
00:44:49,251 --> 00:44:52,186
Have you ever thought of me as
your real daughter for a single moment?

563
00:44:52,333 --> 00:44:53,669
You... You... Leave!

564
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:55,225
Go back to your mother!

565
00:44:55,313 --> 00:44:56,883
Leave, get out of my face!

566
00:44:57,059 --> 00:44:59,320
I'd love to do that right away.

567
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:01,536
But you can forget about me leaving.

568
00:45:01,712 --> 00:45:02,769
What?

569
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,519
Didn't you say I only bring you bad luck?

570
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,838
Then, I'll first witness 
your downfall before I leave.

571
00:45:08,102 --> 00:45:09,056
Th...That...

572
00:45:09,232 --> 00:45:11,316
Listen to her!

573
00:45:11,801 --> 00:45:12,902
My head...

574
00:45:13,034 --> 00:45:15,077
- My head!
- Mom.

575
00:45:15,199 --> 00:45:18,114
I can't take it anymore!

576
00:46:03,852 --> 00:46:05,717
Mom...

577
00:46:06,685 --> 00:46:09,511
Where have you gone?

578
00:46:10,374 --> 00:46:13,137
Come and take me with you.

579
00:46:13,959 --> 00:46:15,838
Mom...

580
00:47:16,230 --> 00:47:21,411
You... What are you
waiting outside here for?

581
00:47:22,277 --> 00:47:23,903
Go.

582
00:47:24,684 --> 00:47:26,166
Did you cry?

583
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:29,131
Mind your business and just go.

584
00:47:31,721 --> 00:47:33,687
Have you had dinner?

585
00:47:33,849 --> 00:47:35,948
What am I, like you, starving all day?

586
00:47:36,051 --> 00:47:38,017
I was just worried about you...
What's with the attitude?

587
00:47:38,149 --> 00:47:39,309
Why would you worry about me?

588
00:47:39,441 --> 00:47:40,718
What are we, friends or something?

589
00:47:40,865 --> 00:47:42,245
Aren't we?!

590
00:47:42,421 --> 00:47:45,723
You worried about me as well.
And even bought me that guide.

591
00:47:46,265 --> 00:47:47,374
Don't get any strange ideas.

592
00:47:47,507 --> 00:47:51,132
I just bought it out of compassion,
since you're out here alone shining shoes.

593
00:48:23,129 --> 00:48:25,126
<i>I'm sorry...</i>

594
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:26,902
<i>Lee Daesoo...</i>

595
00:48:27,225 --> 00:48:29,705
<i>Forgive me...</i>

596
00:48:29,881 --> 00:48:33,756
Daesoo... Daesoo!
Lee Daesoo...

597
00:48:33,972 --> 00:48:35,843
Lee Daesoo...

598
00:48:44,816 --> 00:48:48,544
Didn't you go to school today?

599
00:48:48,735 --> 00:48:51,509
Send me back to my mother.

600
00:48:52,891 --> 00:48:54,247
Again with that?

601
00:48:54,422 --> 00:48:57,975
Haven't you heard about having 
to leave the house in a week?

602
00:48:59,076 --> 00:49:01,997
Wouldn't it be better 
to have one less mouth to feed?

603
00:49:03,643 --> 00:49:06,283
I'm not going to let that bring me down.

604
00:49:06,588 --> 00:49:09,263
I'll never let my family starve.

605
00:49:09,381 --> 00:49:11,832
I wish you'd just go bankrupt.

606
00:49:12,111 --> 00:49:15,589
If you can't afford to raise me anymore,
you'll send me back to my mother.

607
00:49:15,781 --> 00:49:17,439
You little...

608
00:49:19,685 --> 00:49:22,561
Whatever the case, there is no way.

609
00:49:22,723 --> 00:49:24,117
Dad.

610
00:49:24,767 --> 00:49:25,941
It's cold.

611
00:49:26,149 --> 00:49:28,246
Go back home.

612
00:49:30,565 --> 00:49:34,704
Ehh... Those fools, 
they didn't even change the briquette.

613
00:50:07,462 --> 00:50:10,056
What are you doing?

614
00:50:34,158 --> 00:50:36,565
<i>Director! Director...</i>

615
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:38,054
Find refuge.

616
00:50:38,161 --> 00:50:40,631
After hearing of our bankruptcy,
all the subcontractors headed this way.

617
00:50:40,783 --> 00:50:42,231
Our what?

618
00:50:42,394 --> 00:50:43,273
Director Hwang!

619
00:50:43,434 --> 00:50:44,799
He's over there!

620
00:50:44,917 --> 00:50:47,043
Get him!

621
00:50:47,709 --> 00:50:50,580
<i>Wait a moment!</i>

622
00:50:50,836 --> 00:50:53,537
<i>Catch him!</i>

00:50:56,253 --> 00:51:00,025
<i>What you heard is not true! Go back!</i>

624
00:51:00,186 --> 00:51:04,465
Rumors are spreading all over the place, 
how dare you lie to us?

625
00:51:04,568 --> 00:51:07,039
<i>The director is not going to con you.</i>

626
00:51:07,134 --> 00:51:08,663
So just go back!

627
00:51:08,766 --> 00:51:10,659
Get out of the way!

628
00:51:10,777 --> 00:51:13,668

<i>Manbo?! Manbo?!

This is just the beginning.

This Hwang Taeseop and
his Manbo Construction...

635
00:51:46,664 --> 00:51:51,067
are going to reach the very top 
of the construction business.

<i>Manbo! Manbo?!</i>

640
00:52:10,761 --> 00:52:12,155
Stop it!

641
00:52:12,339 --> 00:52:13,228
Who are you?

642
00:52:13,323 --> 00:52:14,444
Are you Hwang Taeseop's daughter?

643
00:52:14,542 --> 00:52:16,207
Why did my father do wrong?

644
00:52:16,301 --> 00:52:18,647
Because of your father, 
we're all about to end up on the street.

645
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:20,257
<i>Out of the way!</i>

646
00:52:20,433 --> 00:52:21,989
Stop it!

647
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:24,773
You little brat!

648
00:52:28,546 --> 00:52:29,867
<i>And who are you?</i>

649
00:52:30,028 --> 00:52:31,540
Who the hell are you?

650
00:52:31,687 --> 00:52:33,201
Stop!

651
00:52:35,077 --> 00:52:37,543
Stop there!

652
00:53:02,617 --> 00:53:06,279
Shouldn't you thank people,
in situations like this?

653
00:53:06,986 --> 00:53:09,949
Never asked for your help.

654
00:53:11,575 --> 00:53:13,031
Hey.

655
00:53:14,741 --> 00:53:16,839
Aren't you taking this?

656
00:53:25,866 --> 00:53:27,584
Thank me first.

657
00:53:30,031 --> 00:53:31,564
I'm waiting.

658
00:53:34,182 --> 00:53:37,465
"Daddy's little girl kept putting on airs, 
but now it just serves you right!"

659
00:53:37,645 --> 00:53:40,576
If you want to mock me,
go ahead and do it.

660
00:53:40,723 --> 00:53:43,086
Is there anyone who would mock
a friend who's having it hard?

661
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:44,172
Friend?!

662
00:53:44,349 --> 00:53:45,596
And who would be my friend?

663
00:53:45,783 --> 00:53:50,332
I know, that you don't think of
a shoeshine boy like me as a friend.

664
00:53:50,509 --> 00:53:54,555
But I don't care about that now.

665
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:07,463
What is this?

666
00:54:08,358 --> 00:54:11,265
As you can see, it's briquette ash.

667
00:54:12,727 --> 00:54:17,209
Are you telling me you want to
use this at the construction site?

668
00:54:17,394 --> 00:54:21,047
Chief, I'm not saying I will...

669
00:54:21,452 --> 00:54:26,668
I was just wondering if you could analyze 
whether it would be possible to do so.

670
00:54:26,903 --> 00:54:28,033
<i>Chief.</i>

671
00:54:28,239 --> 00:54:35,255
The entire country is in tumult,
because everyone is lacking sand.

672
00:54:36,218 --> 00:54:40,710
If we could use briquette ash
instead, we'd solve that problem,

673
00:54:40,897 --> 00:54:43,381
while at the same time 
deal with waste disposal,

674
00:54:43,553 --> 00:54:47,711
so think how beneficial this
could be for the entire country.

675
00:54:48,049 --> 00:54:50,984
It's a fascinating proposal.

676
00:54:51,446 --> 00:54:57,062
However, whether briquette ash 
can replace sand and gravel...

677
00:54:57,223 --> 00:55:01,905
And that is the reason I came to 
the research center right away.

678
00:55:02,904 --> 00:55:04,092
Fine.

679
00:55:04,236 --> 00:55:08,557
We will analyze its efficacy.

680
00:55:09,379 --> 00:55:10,913
Chief.

681
00:55:11,155 --> 00:55:12,828
Thank you.

682
00:55:15,157 --> 00:55:16,453
By the way,

683
00:55:16,997 --> 00:55:22,075
how long are we talking about,
until the results will be available?

684
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,002
What can I say...

685
00:55:24,222 --> 00:55:29,154
At the very least,
I think it will probably take five days.

686
00:55:29,315 --> 00:55:30,592
Yes...

687
00:55:31,091 --> 00:55:32,867
Five days.

688
00:55:33,315 --> 00:55:34,306
Chief.

689
00:55:34,518 --> 00:55:36,874
Is there no way to speed up the process?

690
00:55:37,036 --> 00:55:39,384
At the very least, it'll take that long.

691
00:55:39,531 --> 00:55:41,179
I see...

692
00:55:43,632 --> 00:55:49,487
Anyhow, the moment you have the results, 
please give me a call.

693
00:55:53,519 --> 00:55:55,373
Shameless bastards.

694
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:59,637
If I had been here,
this wouldn't have happened.

695
00:56:02,283 --> 00:56:04,108
<i>Jeongyeon.</i>

696
00:56:04,621 --> 00:56:06,679
Where is your father?

697
00:56:08,293 --> 00:56:10,454
I don't know.

698
00:56:12,138 --> 00:56:15,128
Where on earth has he gone,
without saying a word?

699
00:56:15,449 --> 00:56:16,846
It can't be anything
wrong with him, can it?!

700
00:56:17,022 --> 00:56:18,871
A few days ago, the director
of Paldo Construction...

701
00:56:19,018 --> 00:56:21,454
committed suicide after going bankrupt...

702
00:56:21,601 --> 00:56:22,878
<i>Hey!</i>

703
00:56:23,069 --> 00:56:26,041
<i>Don't even say that!</i>

704
00:56:34,944 --> 00:56:36,479
Hello?

705
00:56:37,726 --> 00:56:39,459
Dad...

706
00:56:40,971 --> 00:56:42,072
Jeongyeon.

707
00:56:42,218 --> 00:56:44,802
Listen well.

708
00:56:44,992 --> 00:56:53,013
Go home, and bring me my seal
and the landfill contract.

709
00:56:53,275 --> 00:56:57,402
The people who are after me 
might be trailing you,

710
00:56:57,578 --> 00:56:59,516
so you mustn't tell anyone.

711
00:56:59,677 --> 00:57:01,453
Understood?

712
00:57:03,527 --> 00:57:06,100
- Yes.
- Hey... Jeongyeon.

713
00:57:06,262 --> 00:57:09,315
<i>Don't tell your mother, either.</i>

714
00:57:09,491 --> 00:57:11,942
<i>I'll see you later tonight.</i>

715
00:57:12,104 --> 00:57:13,014
Dad!

716
00:57:13,133 --> 00:57:14,496
Dad.

717
00:57:14,693 --> 00:57:15,714
What did he say?

718
00:57:15,882 --> 00:57:17,901
Where is he now?

719
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:43,616
Dad.

720
00:57:44,350 --> 00:57:45,774
Dad?

721
00:57:46,112 --> 00:57:47,873
<i>I'm here!</i>

722
00:57:54,298 --> 00:57:56,169
Here you are.

723
00:57:57,231 --> 00:57:58,811
What's with him?

724
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:01,923
<i>I didn't know the way,
so I brought him along.</i>

725
00:58:03,491 --> 00:58:04,956
You little...

726
00:58:05,298 --> 00:58:08,065
You don't need to worry about him.

727
00:58:10,150 --> 00:58:12,512
My seal and the contract.

728
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:21,054
Also, I won't be able to
come home for the time being,

729
00:58:21,245 --> 00:58:23,935
so tell that to your mother.

730
00:58:24,831 --> 00:58:29,740
By any chance, 
do you have any money on you?

731
00:58:30,863 --> 00:58:32,390
I'll bring some tomorrow morning.

732
00:58:32,522 --> 00:58:34,943
Forget it.

733
00:58:35,190 --> 00:58:41,192
If you keep meeting me and
they start smelling us out...

734
00:58:42,057 --> 00:58:46,312
Go back before curfew begins.

735
00:58:46,870 --> 00:58:48,764
Dad.

736
00:58:54,127 --> 00:58:56,233
Don't die.

737
00:58:59,269 --> 00:59:03,643
Don't even think of committing suicide...

738
00:59:07,327 --> 00:59:09,763
I'm sorry, Dad...

739
00:59:09,925 --> 00:59:13,334
I won't make you suffer again.

740
00:59:13,506 --> 00:59:15,066
I'll stop looking for my mother,

741
00:59:15,169 --> 00:59:19,000
and be good to Jeongshik and your wife.

742
00:59:19,235 --> 00:59:22,156
<i>So don't die, Dad...</i>

743
00:59:24,915 --> 00:59:28,343
If you do, I'll kill myself as well.

744
00:59:39,013 --> 00:59:41,265
<i>I'm not dying, you silly.</i>

745
00:59:42,257 --> 00:59:46,720
Why would I leave my daughter behind?

746
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:50,169
<i>When you're all grown up,</i>

747
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:53,971
after you get married
and I see my grandchildren,

748
00:59:54,088 --> 00:59:55,996
then I can die.

749
00:59:56,128 --> 00:59:58,579
Why would I die now?

750
01:00:02,008 --> 01:00:05,592
Daddy will be back soon.

751
01:00:09,306 --> 01:00:12,036
It's all right, you silly.

752
01:01:01,566 --> 01:01:04,237
<i>Hwang Taeseop has been nowhere
to be seen the last two days.</i>

753
01:01:04,384 --> 01:01:08,043
We can't just wait without doing a thing.

754
01:01:08,570 --> 01:01:13,517
He brought his seal and contract along,
so we can't force him out.

755
01:01:13,767 --> 01:01:17,216
Then, are you telling me to
just wait as long as it takes?

756
01:01:17,353 --> 01:01:19,330
Let's just give it another two days.

757
01:01:19,638 --> 01:01:21,643
If he still refuses to show up by then,

758
01:01:22,205 --> 01:01:25,870
we'll get a search warrant and find him.

759
01:01:28,953 --> 01:01:30,332
Let me finish!

760
01:01:30,450 --> 01:01:34,677
- You had enough!
- Let's eat some, dammit!

761
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:42,983
Are you going to stuff yourselves all day?

762
01:01:43,145 --> 01:01:45,169
Are you going to work or what?

763
01:02:06,689 --> 01:02:09,054
What's with all the beggars
straight from the morning?!

764
01:02:16,025 --> 01:02:20,345
What... Beggar?!
You little runt...

765
01:02:41,134 --> 01:02:43,551
Ehh... Little runts...

01:03:51,854 --> 01:03:55,435
<i>You little runts, 
elders have the precedence!</i>

774
01:03:55,567 --> 01:03:57,036
Just wait.

775
01:03:57,396 --> 01:03:58,826
It's ready. Let's eat.

776
01:03:58,958 --> 01:04:01,201
As a sign of friendship
between our two countries,

777
01:04:01,311 --> 01:04:03,593
how about we entertain
our troops with a concert?

778
01:04:03,686 --> 01:04:06,399
<i>We'll steal the document that night.</i>

779
01:04:06,546 --> 01:04:08,718
<i>At the committee meeting tomorrow,</i>

780
01:04:08,850 --> 01:04:11,683
<i>we will be assigned the lot in Banpo.</i>

781
01:04:11,815 --> 01:04:13,371
Are the results ready?

782
01:04:13,473 --> 01:04:15,939
<i>Can we use briquette ash?</i>

783
01:04:16,071 --> 01:04:18,713
If you see Director Hwang,
call me right away.

784
01:04:18,831 --> 01:04:19,770
<i>I'll give you 20,000 won.</i>

785
01:04:19,858 --> 01:04:21,331
About Director Hwang...

786
01:04:21,419 --> 01:04:22,975
Give me a new pair of socks.

787
01:04:23,121 --> 01:04:26,218
I've worn these a few days,
and they smell sour already.

788
01:04:26,336 --> 01:04:27,143
What are you writing?

789
01:04:27,216 --> 01:04:30,724
<i>I'll list every penny you owe me,
so prepare to pay later.</i>

790
01:04:30,886 --> 01:04:33,132
<i>What is this,
do you like me or something?</i>

791
01:04:33,264 --> 01:04:35,010
<i>Do you think you're that pretty?</i>

792
01:04:35,142 --> 01:04:37,166
<i>I only like girls with pretty faces.</i>

793
01:04:37,239 --> 01:04:38,971
I'll be reassigned to the KCIA.

794
01:04:39,088 --> 01:04:40,542
Do you realize what that means?

795
01:04:40,630 --> 01:04:42,567
It's a little country within our country...

796
01:04:42,714 --> 01:04:44,637
<i>Right at the core of power.</i>

797
01:04:44,769 --> 01:04:48,673
Would you like to join me and work there?
