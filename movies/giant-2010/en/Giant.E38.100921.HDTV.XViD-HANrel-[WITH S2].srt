4
00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:08,231
- Gangmo...
- Let go!

5
00:00:08,385 --> 00:00:10,727
- You've lost all reason!
- You bet I did.

6
00:00:10,806 --> 00:00:13,574
There's no stopping me now.

7
00:00:14,129 --> 00:00:14,961
Gangmo...

8
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:18,984
That's the piece of shit
who ruined our Miju!

9
00:00:19,121 --> 00:00:22,505
And now he's trying to ruin me as well!

10
00:00:27,491 --> 00:00:30,665
And in conclusion, you've become
chairman at such a young age,

11
00:00:30,757 --> 00:00:32,743
can you tell us your future aspirations?

12
00:00:32,911 --> 00:00:39,522
I have a keen interest in the
social role corporations can play.

13
00:00:39,864 --> 00:00:42,447
Profits are certainly important,

14
00:00:42,553 --> 00:00:47,208
but they always pale in comparison
with the contribution your...

15
00:00:57,093 --> 00:01:01,742
What is President Lee Gangmo of
Hangang Construction doing here?

16
00:01:02,022 --> 00:01:05,124
There's a limit to my patience!

17
00:01:07,762 --> 00:01:09,932
So, what?

18
00:01:10,183 --> 00:01:11,427
Are you gonna hit me?

19
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:13,680
Think I couldn't?

20
00:01:18,277 --> 00:01:21,273
If you want your face on every 
major newspaper's front page...

21
00:01:21,366 --> 00:01:23,502
Be my guest.

22
00:01:23,985 --> 00:01:26,701
You don't have the guts to do that.

23
00:01:26,778 --> 00:01:28,681
<i>Know why?</i>

24
00:01:28,823 --> 00:01:33,597
Because you can act tough all you want,
but you still remain a weakling.

25
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:38,992
A joint syndicate?!

26
00:01:39,497 --> 00:01:43,989
Know why you were swept away
like leaves under the autumn wind?

27
00:01:44,329 --> 00:01:46,555
<i>Because you're weak.</i>

28
00:01:47,088 --> 00:01:49,479
And a bunch of cowards.

29
00:01:55,607 --> 00:01:58,577
So that's why you'll never make it.

30
00:02:02,113 --> 00:02:04,937
You'll only be bait for the big fish.

31
00:02:11,649 --> 00:02:13,315
Gangmo...

32
00:02:14,517 --> 00:02:15,902
Weakling?

33
00:02:16,012 --> 00:02:17,984
Coward?!

34
00:02:18,182 --> 00:02:19,792
I told you, didn't I?

35
00:02:19,895 --> 00:02:21,806
That any time I see pompous fools
trying to act like big fish,

36
00:02:21,956 --> 00:02:24,140
I get the urge to devour them!

37
00:02:35,508 --> 00:02:36,964
Stop!

38
00:02:38,217 --> 00:02:39,179
Chairman...

39
00:02:39,277 --> 00:02:41,003
Chairman!

40
00:02:41,133 --> 00:02:43,125
Gangmo!

41
00:02:47,836 --> 00:02:49,244
Director Moon...

42
00:02:49,351 --> 00:02:51,660
Report him to the police immediately.

43
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:53,265
Right away.

44
00:02:59,492 --> 00:03:01,644
You caught it all on film, right?

45
00:03:16,913 --> 00:03:18,759
Are you all right?

46
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,010
Thanks, Hyung.

47
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:31,404
<i>- Happy Credit -</i>

48
00:03:36,736 --> 00:03:38,860
<i>Good morning.</i>

49
00:03:42,473 --> 00:03:43,584
Eonni...

50
00:03:43,694 --> 00:03:45,040
Can't we just get this out of the way?

51
00:03:45,097 --> 00:03:47,411
Aww... It's such a nuisance.

52
00:03:47,516 --> 00:03:51,196
We might need it as collateral, 
so keep it here.

53
00:03:55,655 --> 00:03:58,598
<i>Construction Firm President Assaults
Manbo Construction Chairman Jo Minwoo</i>

54
00:04:01,692 --> 00:04:05,172
<i>Currently Hospitalized for Treatment,
Chairman Jo Receives 4-week Prognosis</i>

55
00:04:20,854 --> 00:04:23,676
<i>- Gangmo.
- This way.</i>

56
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:29,281
<i>Gangmo, what is all this about?</i>

57
00:04:29,406 --> 00:04:33,176
Your face is all over
this morning's newspapers.

58
00:04:33,411 --> 00:04:34,656
I'm sorry to all of you.

59
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,567
No need to feel sorry!

60
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,506
Hey... You did well.

61
00:04:38,849 --> 00:04:41,658
If anyone deserves to be
behind bars, that's Jo Minwoo.

62
00:04:41,786 --> 00:04:43,241
<i>What did you ever do wrong?</i>

63
00:04:43,369 --> 00:04:44,510
<i>That's right...</i>

64
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:47,816
He's the one who should be 
punished by the law.

65
00:04:47,901 --> 00:04:50,761
While you were at it, 
why not rough him up for good?

66
00:04:50,905 --> 00:04:54,803
For the time being, you two
take care of the construction site.

67
00:04:54,903 --> 00:04:57,219
- All right...
- All right, don't you worry.

68
00:04:57,331 --> 00:04:59,933
You handle things at the office, Shideok.

69
00:05:00,043 --> 00:05:01,020
All right.

70
00:05:01,149 --> 00:05:05,194
Even without me, 
it must be business as usual.

71
00:05:05,297 --> 00:05:06,133
Is that clear?

72
00:05:06,233 --> 00:05:08,572
President...

73
00:05:11,306 --> 00:05:13,990
<i>What now...</i>

74
00:05:21,428 --> 00:05:22,977
Aigoo... Here they are.

75
00:05:23,091 --> 00:05:25,785
Minwoo, are you all right?

76
00:05:25,953 --> 00:05:28,011
I only let them hospitalize me 
to play up the press,

77
00:05:28,154 --> 00:05:29,884
so no need to worry.

78
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:32,410
So what happened?

79
00:05:32,864 --> 00:05:34,923
I underestimated him.

80
00:05:35,033 --> 00:05:39,522
I never imagined Lee Gangmo would
hit me before all those cameras.

81
00:05:39,665 --> 00:05:43,344
In business and politics, 
your image is the most important thing.

82
00:05:43,472 --> 00:05:47,106
This will negatively affect you as well.

83
00:05:48,061 --> 00:05:49,875
And what did Minwoo ever do wrong?

84
00:05:49,946 --> 00:05:51,101
The blame is all on who hit him.

85
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,409
If you don't know what you're
talking about, just keep quiet.

86
00:05:54,851 --> 00:05:57,433
All the government funding which
was promised to Hangang Construction...

87
00:05:57,532 --> 00:05:59,652
has been canceled.

88
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:04,562
Walk all over Lee Gangmo, 
so that he won't get a chance to recover.

89
00:06:05,275 --> 00:06:08,164
If I only stopped at
paying him back for this,

90
00:06:08,944 --> 00:06:11,629
that wouldn't be much of a revenge.

91
00:06:28,098 --> 00:06:30,339
Just hang in there a little longer.

92
00:06:31,325 --> 00:06:33,091
They'll soon release you on probation.

93
00:06:33,205 --> 00:06:34,945
Sorry, Hyung.

94
00:06:35,526 --> 00:06:38,880
But I don't regret this.

95
00:06:39,728 --> 00:06:43,457
If I hadn't done that,
it would have driven me crazy.

96
00:06:43,643 --> 00:06:45,611
I know what you mean.

97
00:06:47,332 --> 00:06:51,899
The Ministry of Construction 
decided to cut your funding after all.

98
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:57,954
Won't you have to halt
the construction now?

99
00:06:58,254 --> 00:06:59,452
Nah.

100
00:06:59,675 --> 00:07:01,648
I'm not giving up.

101
00:07:02,313 --> 00:07:03,603
I'll take this to the end.

102
00:07:03,696 --> 00:07:05,369
What Jo Pilyeon wants...

103
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:11,123
is for you to put all your eggs in
this one basket and end up ruined.

104
00:07:11,908 --> 00:07:14,332
I'll handle those company matters, Hyung.

105
00:07:14,617 --> 00:07:18,644
That's that, 
but still no news from Miju?

106
00:08:10,207 --> 00:08:13,888
All the choreographers and singing trainers
are sparing no compliments about her.

107
00:08:13,973 --> 00:08:15,615
Lee Miju, you said?

108
00:08:15,721 --> 00:08:17,008
Yes.

109
00:08:17,187 --> 00:08:23,042
But do you really plan to
groom her into a top attraction?

110
00:08:23,855 --> 00:08:26,479
It would be a waste
to limit her to our stage.

111
00:08:26,579 --> 00:08:29,185
<i>Th...Then...</i>

112
00:08:46,999 --> 00:08:48,326
Where do you live?

113
00:08:48,441 --> 00:08:49,851
Hannam-Dong.

114
00:08:49,979 --> 00:08:51,730
Family?

115
00:08:52,546 --> 00:08:54,583
I live... alone.

116
00:08:54,707 --> 00:08:59,120
If you really wish to succeed, 
you must put everything on the line.

117
00:08:59,277 --> 00:09:01,748
<i>And even if you do, nobody
can guarantee you'll make it.</i>

118
00:09:01,891 --> 00:09:04,172
I really want to
become a successful singer.

119
00:09:04,315 --> 00:09:06,682
Everyone starts
with your same intentions,

120
00:09:06,782 --> 00:09:09,334
but real success comes very rarely.

121
00:09:10,874 --> 00:09:13,013
And that's because not only
you won't make it without effort,

122
00:09:13,099 --> 00:09:15,552
even effort alone can never be enough.

123
00:09:16,359 --> 00:09:19,903
Practice will be very severe.

124
00:09:20,323 --> 00:09:22,506
If you don't think you can
handle that, better give up now.

125
00:09:22,631 --> 00:09:24,300
No, Director...

126
00:09:24,503 --> 00:09:28,694
I'm confident I can make it.

127
00:09:37,015 --> 00:09:38,477
I'm back...

128
00:09:38,591 --> 00:09:40,189
Did you just finish?

129
00:09:40,296 --> 00:09:42,005
Yes...

130
00:09:43,454 --> 00:09:45,500
My legs are killing me.

131
00:09:45,814 --> 00:09:50,014
Still, see how far you've come?
Getting opportunities like this.

132
00:09:50,797 --> 00:09:52,322
You're right.

133
00:09:52,428 --> 00:09:54,255
But, how about Wooju?

134
00:09:54,363 --> 00:09:56,309
Don't know what upset him today,

135
00:09:56,466 --> 00:10:00,198
but after making a fuss all evening, 
he fell asleep only now.

136
00:10:26,486 --> 00:10:29,235
Mommy...

137
00:10:30,136 --> 00:10:31,631
<i>Come here.</i>

138
00:10:31,844 --> 00:10:33,456
Here...

139
00:10:36,654 --> 00:10:38,894
Sleep.

140
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:46,715
Sleep well, my Wooju.

141
00:10:48,576 --> 00:10:55,016
In the garden and over the hills,

142
00:10:55,139 --> 00:11:06,855
Even birds and lambs are asleep.

143
00:11:07,748 --> 00:11:13,773
As the moonlight
shines through the window.

144
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:20,376
Sleep well, my baby.

145
00:11:22,344 --> 00:11:29,156
<i>In the garden and over the hills,</i>

146
00:11:33,007 --> 00:11:47,917
Even birds and lambs are asleep.

147
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:03,950
Wooju.

148
00:12:04,465 --> 00:12:12,763
Mommy will succeed, 
and make your every dream come true.

149
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:16,174
So grow up into a healthy boy.

150
00:12:16,388 --> 00:12:18,313
Are we clear?

151
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:47,287
Here's his registration number
directly from the States.

152
00:12:48,422 --> 00:12:54,037
So that Han Sojin does
own real estate overseas?!

153
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,805
He looked so young...

154
00:12:55,948 --> 00:12:58,714
Must be really rich.

155
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:12,307
Have a nice day.

156
00:13:15,726 --> 00:13:17,690
They're not calling?!

157
00:13:17,818 --> 00:13:21,277
Did they smell a rat?

158
00:13:21,386 --> 00:13:23,537
They'll call soon.

159
00:13:25,178 --> 00:13:28,841
Since I forged my ID using
a real landowner living overseas.

160
00:13:28,927 --> 00:13:32,021
There is no way 
Hwang Jeongyeon could find out.

161
00:13:34,599 --> 00:13:35,914
See, you fool?

162
00:13:35,971 --> 00:13:38,189
Told you they'd call.

163
00:13:42,602 --> 00:13:43,771
Yes...

164
00:13:43,899 --> 00:13:46,663
<i>Han Sojin? Happy Credit here.</i>

165
00:13:46,751 --> 00:13:48,648
Ohh... Yes! Director Hwang.

166
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:50,373
<i>Our background check is complete.</i>

167
00:13:50,487 --> 00:13:52,383
<i>You can just bring us
a copy of your account book.</i>

168
00:13:52,483 --> 00:13:54,659
Yes, I'll bring it tomorrow.

169
00:13:54,865 --> 00:13:56,519
Yes...

170
00:13:57,873 --> 00:14:00,597
Bait is taken!

171
00:14:09,358 --> 00:14:11,677
What brings you here?

172
00:14:11,827 --> 00:14:14,660
Found a way to target Hwang Jeongyeon?

173
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:15,941
Sure.

174
00:14:16,095 --> 00:14:19,563
I can get my hands on
all her money in a month.

175
00:14:19,707 --> 00:14:21,150
Quite confident.

176
00:14:21,263 --> 00:14:23,395
Anything I snitch will be mine...

177
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:25,203
I should give my best.

178
00:14:25,332 --> 00:14:27,285
You don't have much time.

179
00:14:27,514 --> 00:14:32,105
Success or failure, 
you only have one month.

180
00:14:33,032 --> 00:14:36,027
Is Baekpa doing well?

181
00:14:36,174 --> 00:14:37,781
He is.

182
00:14:37,872 --> 00:14:41,596
And you as well.

183
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:43,630
Yes, I'm fine.

184
00:14:43,738 --> 00:14:46,616
Ohh... Good to hear.

185
00:14:46,827 --> 00:14:48,912
I had this fine ginseng I got
from an acquaintance of mine...

186
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,552
I'll just send it your way.

187
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:52,084
No need.

188
00:14:52,181 --> 00:14:56,391
Once you're done,
contact the Royal Club.

189
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,633
Fine.

190
00:15:08,273 --> 00:15:11,351
If she didn't get in the way, 
I would have never had to live this way.

191
00:15:11,446 --> 00:15:12,866
What?

192
00:15:13,004 --> 00:15:15,781
Her place was mine.

193
00:15:15,911 --> 00:15:18,576
She took it away from me.

194
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,613
Yoo Gyeongok...

195
00:15:21,813 --> 00:15:25,120
Don't act all important.

196
00:15:25,469 --> 00:15:29,812
Think I don't know that
Hwang Jeongyeon is your daughter?

197
00:15:30,683 --> 00:15:37,227
That daughter of yours will pay back 
for everything you did to me.

198
00:15:39,485 --> 00:15:42,570
<i>- Jong-Ro Police Department -</i>

199
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:45,830
Gangmo.

200
00:15:49,695 --> 00:15:51,305
Shall we go for a drink, Sir?

201
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,984
I need to go to the construction site.

202
00:15:53,075 --> 00:15:55,019
I've left it unattended for far too long.

203
00:15:55,129 --> 00:15:58,980
Ehh... How nasty, wanted
to get piss drunk with you...

204
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:00,666
Sorry, Hyung. 
Let's do that another time.

205
00:16:00,763 --> 00:16:04,186
Ahh... Yes, certainly, President!
Aigoo, as you wish!

206
00:16:30,544 --> 00:16:34,353
At this rate, how long will it
take to remove all the rock bed?

207
00:16:35,065 --> 00:16:37,889
How long is not the issue.

208
00:16:38,076 --> 00:16:42,979
It's whether we'll be still in business
by the time we finish laying foundations.

209
00:16:43,122 --> 00:16:45,871
Wonder if they've heard about
the government cutting our funding,

210
00:16:46,013 --> 00:16:49,375
but the subcontractors
are starting to get restless.

211
00:16:49,635 --> 00:16:51,350
How about our finances?

212
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,318
Pretty serious.

213
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:56,566
Looks like we might
soon need another loan.

214
00:16:58,574 --> 00:17:00,116
<i>Gangmo...</i>

215
00:17:00,354 --> 00:17:02,770
Before we go belly up,

216
00:17:02,899 --> 00:17:05,875
let's just drop out of this.

217
00:17:05,987 --> 00:17:07,546
He's right, Gangmo.

218
00:17:07,656 --> 00:17:11,583
It's nothing we can solve on our own.

219
00:17:11,677 --> 00:17:14,278
This construction is not the issue!

220
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:18,130
If we're excluded from
the New City concessions,

221
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:22,579
we'll never rise above third-rate status.

222
00:17:23,992 --> 00:17:26,686
Let's give it all we've got.

223
00:17:26,954 --> 00:17:31,131
If we endure this to the end, 
we'll find a way.

224
00:17:46,934 --> 00:17:48,847
The fight now will be
fought with raw materials.

225
00:17:48,975 --> 00:17:50,573
What are our most pressing needs?

226
00:17:50,701 --> 00:17:51,742
Aggregate*.

227
00:17:50,701 --> 00:17:56,291
<i>{\a6}*slag, crushed stone, and all other
material used to reinforce composite</i>

228
00:17:51,856 --> 00:17:56,294
There's a war raging between competitors
to secure aggregate in the Suseo area.

229
00:17:56,387 --> 00:17:59,699
Even if you have to pay
double, secure it at all cost.

230
00:17:59,805 --> 00:18:03,763
But the other committee
members would protest that.

231
00:18:03,963 --> 00:18:05,577
It doesn't matter.

232
00:18:05,687 --> 00:18:07,325
We might be allies when it
comes to committee issues,

233
00:18:07,425 --> 00:18:09,707
but out on the construction site, 
we're all enemies.

234
00:18:09,863 --> 00:18:11,646
I will proceed as instructed, then.

235
00:18:11,911 --> 00:18:13,318
Right...

236
00:18:13,421 --> 00:18:15,533
Has Hangang Construction not given up yet?

237
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:18,229
Despite facing the impending
prospect of running out of funds,

238
00:18:18,336 --> 00:18:20,809
they're proceeding with
the construction as we speak.

239
00:18:21,915 --> 00:18:24,411
Call the International Bank and
set up a meeting with the president.

240
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:27,134
Why would you suddenly...

241
00:18:27,377 --> 00:18:32,131
Just in case, we need to cut all
possible escape routes they might look for.

242
00:18:32,238 --> 00:18:34,179
All right, Chairman.

243
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:58,151
Manbo Construction is hoarding
aggregate as if there's no tomorrow.

244
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,134
And prices have risen twofold already.

245
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:01,973
<i>Ehh... Motherless twats.</i>

246
00:19:02,087 --> 00:19:05,923
We don't even have money
to finish laying foundations...

247
00:19:06,023 --> 00:19:11,242
If this keeps up, will we even
get a look at that aggregate?

248
00:19:14,143 --> 00:19:20,554
<i>- Manbo Construction -</i>

249
00:19:26,592 --> 00:19:28,531
Let's just go.

250
00:19:31,098 --> 00:19:33,565
Aren't you going to meet Jeongyeon?

251
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:37,423
If she sees me in this state,

252
00:19:37,842 --> 00:19:42,513
it'll only make her
feel more responsible.

253
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:47,533
Unless I first gain
some kind of foothold,

254
00:19:47,756 --> 00:19:51,293
there's nothing that
will give her peace.

255
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,617
<i>That...</i>

256
00:20:01,828 --> 00:20:03,186
Jo Pilyeon!

257
00:20:03,357 --> 00:20:04,783
I ought to just...

258
00:20:04,925 --> 00:20:07,227
Calm down.

259
00:20:07,334 --> 00:20:08,895
Look at him!

260
00:20:08,992 --> 00:20:10,939
<i>Look at how he parades around!</i>

261
00:20:11,048 --> 00:20:16,070
He's prancing around as if he owns the 
place I shed blood and tears to build!

262
00:20:16,164 --> 00:20:18,702
And what would going at him 
possibly accomplish?

263
00:20:18,787 --> 00:20:21,440
<i>I'll be damned...</i>

264
00:20:28,053 --> 00:20:30,255
<i>I did hear he became a congressman...</i>

265
00:20:30,548 --> 00:20:33,339
Sure got himself some influence.

266
00:20:40,337 --> 00:20:43,451
<i>"President Jeon Duhwan condemned
these student demonstrations..."</i>

267
00:20:43,566 --> 00:20:48,937
<i>"as illegal acts of vandalism that can 
only damage our country's reputation..."</i>

268
00:20:49,065 --> 00:20:56,431
<i>"in the international community's eyes, 
as we prepare to host the 1988 Olympic Games."</i>

269
00:20:56,584 --> 00:20:59,967
This country is really
getting out of control.

270
00:21:00,207 --> 00:21:03,076
If left to my discretion,

271
00:21:03,204 --> 00:21:07,682
I could deal with those fools
in no more than three months.

272
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:12,688
Yes?

273
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,657
Yes, Sir!

274
00:21:14,882 --> 00:21:16,411
Turn that off.

275
00:21:16,618 --> 00:21:18,963
Yes, I'm listening, Sir!

276
00:21:19,334 --> 00:21:20,660
<i>Yes, Sir!</i>

277
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:23,313
<i>Yes, Sir. Certainly.</i>

278
00:21:23,524 --> 00:21:25,580
<i>I will come there
right away, Mister President.</i>

279
00:21:27,373 --> 00:21:30,311
Jaechun, get the car.

280
00:21:30,783 --> 00:21:31,922
What is the matter?

281
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:33,758
I need to head to the Blue House.

282
00:21:33,836 --> 00:21:35,302
What are you waiting for?

283
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,193
All right.

284
00:21:50,067 --> 00:21:53,416
How did it go earlier?

285
00:21:55,284 --> 00:22:01,120
The Ministry of Construction will soon
announce a declaration dealing with the North.

286
00:22:01,965 --> 00:22:06,072
Why would the Ministry of
Construction deal with North Korea?

287
00:22:06,227 --> 00:22:09,155
To interfere with the Olympic Games,

288
00:22:09,265 --> 00:22:12,845
the North is building an 
immense dam in Mount Geumgang.

289
00:22:13,045 --> 00:22:16,624
They plan to fill it with water
and release it all at once.

290
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:20,094
Then... What will happen to us?

291
00:22:20,231 --> 00:22:24,652
The flood will submerge the capital
all the way to 63 Building.

292
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,574
Those bastards...

293
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,429
We were already well
aware of such plans...

294
00:22:31,514 --> 00:22:34,723
True or not, it doesn't matter.

295
00:22:36,132 --> 00:22:42,323
We will build a similar structure 
up Bukhan River to contend with them.

296
00:22:42,617 --> 00:22:45,418
So that's why the Ministry
of Construction got involved.

297
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:50,448
A huge amount of money will be
poured into the dam construction sector.

298
00:22:50,905 --> 00:22:54,212
Easy money, as they call it.

299
00:22:54,317 --> 00:22:55,996
Thank you for the precious information.

300
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:58,220
We will devise a plan.

301
00:22:59,019 --> 00:23:05,731
That is why economy and politics 
always go hand in hand.

302
00:23:17,836 --> 00:23:18,818
Hello?

303
00:23:18,904 --> 00:23:20,615
Isn't our president there?

304
00:23:20,801 --> 00:23:22,597
He's not there?

305
00:23:23,743 --> 00:23:26,785
Why isn't he coming?
We don't have a minute to waste.

306
00:23:26,884 --> 00:23:28,660
Gangmo...

307
00:23:28,955 --> 00:23:30,185
This is serious.

308
00:23:30,297 --> 00:23:31,999
Head to the construction site right away.

309
00:23:32,156 --> 00:23:33,369
Why, what's the matter?

310
00:23:33,462 --> 00:23:37,609
The subcontractors are threatening
to abandon the construction.

311
00:23:37,794 --> 00:23:39,406
What?!

312
00:23:47,206 --> 00:23:49,188
Where are you going?

313
00:23:49,317 --> 00:23:51,692
Didn't they cut all your funding?

314
00:23:51,792 --> 00:23:53,560
<i>And who said that?</i>

315
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,514
We have plenty of options 
left on the table.

316
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:58,252
Then, shall we start
by settling our advances?

317
00:23:58,309 --> 00:24:00,177
Here, folks... Don't act like this.

318
00:24:00,262 --> 00:24:02,494
Let's just finish working, uh?

319
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:05,439
Shouldn't you finish working if you 
want us to get the money to pay you?

320
00:24:05,524 --> 00:24:09,972
Anyhow, if you don't pay us, 
we're not going to work.

321
00:24:10,075 --> 00:24:11,866
Here... Let's all go.

322
00:24:11,937 --> 00:24:14,444
Fine... As you wish.

323
00:24:15,631 --> 00:24:17,256
Let's do this.

324
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,593
You've been working hard all this time,

325
00:24:20,845 --> 00:24:24,269
so I'll give you a week off.

326
00:24:26,282 --> 00:24:29,448
Then, will everything
be settled in a week?

327
00:24:29,546 --> 00:24:30,978
Of course.

328
00:24:31,427 --> 00:24:35,072
So there will be no interruption,
but just a temporary break.

329
00:24:35,175 --> 00:24:38,625
<i>You know that once the week is up,
you'll have to come back to work, right?</i>

330
00:24:38,732 --> 00:24:41,758
<i>Since you're there, enjoy a good rest.</i>

331
00:24:41,883 --> 00:24:46,779
Because after that, there will be no
days off until the construction is complete.

332
00:24:46,878 --> 00:24:48,809
Are we clear?

333
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:52,089
Guess we'll see each other in a week.

334
00:24:56,951 --> 00:24:58,118
Gangmo...

335
00:24:58,275 --> 00:25:00,742
Is there a way to get us 
out of trouble in a week?

336
00:25:00,842 --> 00:25:01,583
There's none.

337
00:25:01,683 --> 00:25:03,068
<i>None?!</i>

338
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,918
If there's none, 
then why give them time off?

339
00:25:06,032 --> 00:25:08,414
So that things will
quiet down for a week.

340
00:25:08,742 --> 00:25:10,464
We'll have to find a way before then.

341
00:25:10,555 --> 00:25:14,113
Ehh Ehh... Look what
nonsense he gets us into...

342
00:25:14,183 --> 00:25:15,941
Go back to the office.

343
00:25:16,047 --> 00:25:18,371
For the next week, I'll remain here.

344
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,771
If you stay, let us join you!

345
00:25:20,899 --> 00:25:21,957
Let's just go.

346
00:25:22,069 --> 00:25:24,051
It's best to leave him alone 
when he acts like that.

347
00:25:24,136 --> 00:25:26,986
- Let go, you twat...
- I said come!

348
00:25:47,228 --> 00:25:49,382
The "Peace Dam"?!

349
00:25:49,667 --> 00:25:54,415
It's what they'll call it when
the official announcement is out.

350
00:25:55,173 --> 00:25:58,643
I have my doubts 
about this project as well.

351
00:25:58,814 --> 00:26:04,796
If you want, I could help you get 
involved with the dam construction.

352
00:26:05,177 --> 00:26:08,138
But, is it really true?

353
00:26:08,571 --> 00:26:15,273
Will Seoul really be flooded if the North
makes their Mt. Geumgang dam explode?

354
00:26:15,459 --> 00:26:18,425
Just worry about building that dam.

355
00:26:19,095 --> 00:26:21,629
If it's a lie, I want
no part in this, Hyung.

356
00:26:22,003 --> 00:26:23,829
It's a fraud.

357
00:26:24,389 --> 00:26:27,152
I have no intention of making
dirty money by joining a fraud...

358
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:30,108
perpetrated against our people.

359
00:26:30,721 --> 00:26:34,235
Then, are you going to go on 
with this construction?

360
00:26:34,457 --> 00:26:36,035
I have a week.

361
00:26:36,168 --> 00:26:38,607
I'm sure I can find a way.

362
00:26:48,892 --> 00:26:52,300
I feel so sorry for Gangmo Oppa, 
it's killing me...

363
00:26:52,442 --> 00:26:54,328
How much money does he need?

364
00:26:54,435 --> 00:26:57,104
It's not just a few pennies.

365
00:26:57,321 --> 00:27:01,127
So why even bother building there...

366
00:27:04,629 --> 00:27:08,950
But looks like it's all
because of Manbo Construction.

367
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:12,386
It was Jo Minwoo
who broke up the syndicate,

368
00:27:12,611 --> 00:27:15,843
and he even had a hand in
the bank refusing us loans.

369
00:27:17,491 --> 00:27:21,247
Jo Minwoo... What a bastard.

370
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:31,972
Eonni, why did you
break up with Gangmo Oppa?

371
00:27:32,171 --> 00:27:34,845
<i>I really can't figure you two out.</i>

372
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:38,235
If you like each other, just say it.

373
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,417
What's wrong with you?

374
00:27:40,554 --> 00:27:42,336
Did Gangmo...

375
00:27:42,964 --> 00:27:44,814
say he likes me?

376
00:27:44,924 --> 00:27:47,940
So you didn't know?!

377
00:27:48,543 --> 00:27:54,303
Know why I came to you
for those installments?

378
00:27:55,085 --> 00:28:04,890
That is all because Gangmo Oppa
was wondering how you were doing.

379
00:28:05,849 --> 00:28:08,948
<i>That poor fool...</i>

380
00:28:09,533 --> 00:28:13,939
<i>If he accepted me, I'd be good to him...</i>

381
00:28:29,122 --> 00:28:30,944
We regretfully have to refuse.

382
00:28:31,229 --> 00:28:34,024
The Ministry's funding...

383
00:28:35,545 --> 00:28:37,518
was already given to 
Manbo Construction.

384
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:40,465
If you ever close up shop, blame me.

385
00:28:40,665 --> 00:28:42,048
I'm just a coward!

386
00:28:42,176 --> 00:28:44,586
A son of a bitch!

387
00:29:22,408 --> 00:29:24,966
Be my guest!

388
00:29:26,255 --> 00:29:30,362
I'm not falling down this way!

389
00:29:31,831 --> 00:29:33,129
I'm never,

390
00:29:33,243 --> 00:29:36,109
ever going to be defeated!

391
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:43,629
Even if I have to build those
damned apartments this way!

392
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,564
I'm not...

393
00:29:47,778 --> 00:29:50,616
I'm never going to give up!

394
00:29:50,716 --> 00:29:51,800
Never!

395
00:29:51,857 --> 00:29:53,625
Never...

396
00:29:55,422 --> 00:29:58,174
Never.

397
00:29:59,302 --> 00:30:02,403
I'll never be defeated!

398
00:30:02,959 --> 00:30:04,542
If that's what it takes...

399
00:30:04,642 --> 00:30:08,649
If that's what it takes,
I'll build them here.

400
00:30:08,806 --> 00:30:10,974
Those apartments...

401
00:30:11,216 --> 00:30:13,314
<i>Lee Gangmo...</i>

402
00:30:13,485 --> 00:30:18,177
<i>will never lose!</i>

403
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:20,615
<i>Ever!</i>

404
00:30:38,865 --> 00:30:42,704
It can turn a rock this big 
into gravel in a moment.

405
00:30:42,847 --> 00:30:46,554
We developed this.

406
00:30:51,294 --> 00:30:55,001
<i>- Manbo Construction
Suspected of Hoarding Aggregate -</i>

407
00:31:07,739 --> 00:31:10,057
So what did you want to meet for?

408
00:31:10,182 --> 00:31:12,802
How is your company doing, these days?

409
00:31:12,928 --> 00:31:17,124
Unless you agree to lend us money, 
don't bother asking.

410
00:31:18,732 --> 00:31:22,256
Can you use this 
over rock beds as well?

411
00:31:23,652 --> 00:31:29,095
With a large hydraulic breaker,
it certainly could work.

412
00:31:29,381 --> 00:31:30,764
We'll give you a loan.

413
00:31:30,868 --> 00:31:32,960
Interest will be at normal bank rates.

414
00:31:33,102 --> 00:31:34,395
What?

415
00:31:34,487 --> 00:31:36,449
Wait... Bank... rates?!

416
00:31:36,634 --> 00:31:39,191
Are you really going to
lend us money on the cheap?

417
00:31:39,307 --> 00:31:41,881
Instead, I have a condition.

418
00:31:42,195 --> 00:31:44,210
Have you heard
of Hangang Construction?

419
00:31:44,317 --> 00:31:46,285
Hangang Construction?

420
00:31:46,394 --> 00:31:49,059
Haven't really heard of them,

421
00:31:49,156 --> 00:31:50,824
but why are you asking?

422
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,884
<i>That damned temper of yours...</i>

423
00:32:00,125 --> 00:32:05,872
Aww... Look at these hands, you fool!

424
00:32:06,637 --> 00:32:12,612
- Get moving!
- Is it that heavy, you twat?

425
00:32:13,354 --> 00:32:15,327
Wow... This...

426
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:20,983
Wow, Gangmo here must have croaked.

427
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:23,316
Ahh... Really, listen to that.

428
00:32:24,284 --> 00:32:25,545
Gangmo.

429
00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:27,727
Gangmo, wake up.

430
00:32:30,422 --> 00:32:31,392
What's that?

431
00:32:31,534 --> 00:32:35,641
Ohh... Someone sent this to you.

432
00:32:35,812 --> 00:32:39,257
To be specific, this is
called a "hydraulic breaker."

433
00:32:39,343 --> 00:32:42,055
They use it to break rocks.

434
00:32:42,181 --> 00:32:42,780
<i>Really?</i>

435
00:32:42,851 --> 00:32:44,120
<i>"Really?"</i>

436
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,831
Who sent this?

437
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:50,466
Well, guess they sent it
to advertise their company?!

438
00:32:50,651 --> 00:32:55,257
With this on that rock bed,
it'll take a hundred years longer.

439
00:32:55,457 --> 00:32:59,260
<i>So why did you bring this along?
The hell you know?</i>

440
00:32:59,364 --> 00:33:02,758
Take a look at this paper,
and what... What's this?

441
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:06,465
These were inside the package.

442
00:33:06,862 --> 00:33:08,447
Look.

00:33:13,627 --> 00:33:17,608
Why, what's so new about

446
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:45,242
Take this and follow me.

- You take it, this time!

Hey... Call an ambulance.

453
00:34:24,794 --> 00:34:26,589
Hyungnim, can you see this?

454
00:34:26,683 --> 00:34:27,817
Can you?!

It will speed up things exponentially?!

468
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:10,649
Forget getting rid of it, if we
start fragmenting this huge rock bed...

It's a bunch of rocks!

475
00:35:22,754 --> 00:35:24,579
Aggregate!

That's right, you fool!

crush all that rock with this?

486
00:36:08,394 --> 00:36:10,747
Aigoo, you foolish twat!

487
00:36:10,875 --> 00:36:15,180
You crush rock beds with explosives,

488
00:36:15,294 --> 00:36:19,458
while you'd use that equipment 
to fragment the rocks.

489
00:36:19,515 --> 00:36:22,424
You could have just told me,
why always twat this and twat that?!

490
00:36:22,495 --> 00:36:23,764
'Cause you are one.

491
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:31,740
What it means is, that rock bed will be 
enough to cover aggregate for all Suseo.

492
00:36:31,847 --> 00:36:35,140
Not to mention reducing the costs 
of removing all that rock bed,

493
00:36:35,254 --> 00:36:37,447
and bringing us a ton of money
if we sell that aggregate.

494
00:36:37,533 --> 00:36:40,171
What? Wow!

495
00:36:42,292 --> 00:36:44,078
They're not answering?!

496
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,172
This won't do it.

497
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:46,359
Let's head to the factory.

498
00:36:46,459 --> 00:36:49,050
- Right.
- That...

499
00:36:51,688 --> 00:36:54,585
was developed by us.

500
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:02,255
Nice to meet you.
I'm Go Cheolsu.

501
00:37:02,462 --> 00:37:05,656
How many hydraulic breakers
do you have right now?

502
00:37:05,755 --> 00:37:08,266
How many do you need?

503
00:37:08,435 --> 00:37:10,694
I'd like to buy them all.

504
00:37:10,806 --> 00:37:13,335
All of them?!

505
00:37:13,427 --> 00:37:17,674
Instead, you must give us a discount.

506
00:37:18,091 --> 00:37:20,525
You saved us as well.

507
00:37:20,649 --> 00:37:23,194
Of course we will!

508
00:37:24,891 --> 00:37:28,859
But, how did you find out
we were in this situation?

509
00:37:29,613 --> 00:37:32,676
I read it in the newspaper.

510
00:37:32,785 --> 00:37:34,191
Thank you.

511
00:37:34,316 --> 00:37:39,016
The sample you sent gave me courage.

512
00:37:39,145 --> 00:37:42,083
Ahh... Yes...

513
00:37:46,827 --> 00:37:50,610
We looked into it, and turns out you 
borrowed over 500 million from the bank?

514
00:37:50,781 --> 00:37:54,164
We can only give you about 30 million.

515
00:37:54,471 --> 00:37:56,446
That little?!

516
00:37:56,588 --> 00:37:58,839
I'd easily get fifty elsewhere?!

517
00:37:59,102 --> 00:38:00,995
Then, go ask them.

518
00:38:01,137 --> 00:38:03,136
All right.

519
00:38:03,236 --> 00:38:06,029
At least interest is cheaper here.

520
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:08,824
I'll take that.

521
00:38:13,707 --> 00:38:15,921
Come this way.

522
00:38:41,691 --> 00:38:45,513
Hwang Jeongyeon... 
She's more meticulous than I thought?!

523
00:38:45,727 --> 00:38:49,477
Until I order you to stop,
pay the installments on time.

524
00:38:49,648 --> 00:38:51,345
Yes, Hyungnim.

525
00:38:53,892 --> 00:38:56,297
She's taken the bait,

526
00:38:56,397 --> 00:38:58,450
so now the struggle begins.

527
00:38:58,593 --> 00:39:03,270
Keep pulling the rod, and
she'll soon take a wrong step.

528
00:39:03,427 --> 00:39:07,869
A mistake that will cost her dearly.

529
00:39:23,141 --> 00:39:24,249
Eonni.

530
00:39:24,356 --> 00:39:25,883
Let's go.

531
00:39:29,805 --> 00:39:31,510
Isn't this Director Hwang?!

532
00:39:31,638 --> 00:39:33,327
We meet again?!

533
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:35,160
So you like working out?

534
00:39:35,232 --> 00:39:38,413
In business or anything else,
strength is everything.

535
00:39:38,507 --> 00:39:42,604
Director Hwang...
Ever hit one of these?

536
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:47,055
Ehh... You're always
carrying cash with you.

537
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:49,896
Shouldn't you learn
how to protect yourself?

538
00:39:50,067 --> 00:39:52,705
I always wanted to learn self-defense?!

539
00:39:52,816 --> 00:39:55,486
Here, I'll give you a quick lesson,
so give it a try.

540
00:39:55,558 --> 00:39:59,030
Here... Let's go.

541
00:40:01,255 --> 00:40:03,751
Harder.

542
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:06,262
That's right! Harder.

543
00:40:22,483 --> 00:40:29,221
Our president always 
lives up to his word.

544
00:40:30,973 --> 00:40:32,645
Sit down.

545
00:40:35,735 --> 00:40:37,193
Did you enjoy your time off?

546
00:40:37,288 --> 00:40:38,555
Yes!

547
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:41,283
This gentleman wearing the hat here,
Technical Director Nam Youngchul,

548
00:40:41,368 --> 00:40:42,352
<i>must have explained already?!</i>

549
00:40:42,452 --> 00:40:43,978
You're really something.

550
00:40:44,049 --> 00:40:48,987
How did you manage to turn useless
rock into aggregate?! You're brilliant.

551
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:52,191
I'll only request two things from you.

552
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:58,285
First, we will pay all that is due
to you after selling the aggregate.

553
00:40:58,380 --> 00:40:59,536
May we do that?

554
00:40:59,645 --> 00:41:01,514
- Yes!
- Sure.

555
00:41:01,628 --> 00:41:06,901
Also, we will keep all the aggregate
in a tent and conserve it.

556
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:12,035
Until we actually start selling it, 
please maintain secrecy.

557
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:14,174
That is all.

558
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:31,000
Gangmo.

559
00:41:31,409 --> 00:41:34,430
But, why keep the fact that
we're selling aggregate secret?

560
00:41:34,515 --> 00:41:38,380
Right! We should spread
the word right away!

561
00:41:38,522 --> 00:41:41,903
Manbo Construction keeps
hoarding aggregate at high rates.

562
00:41:41,998 --> 00:41:43,328
So, what...

563
00:41:43,432 --> 00:41:45,239
"Let's force Minwoo to eat his own crap?"

564
00:41:45,324 --> 00:41:47,307
That?!

565
00:41:48,021 --> 00:41:53,481
It was Jo Minwoo who started this fight.

566
00:42:01,704 --> 00:42:05,511
That's a Hangang Construction truck?!

567
00:42:23,556 --> 00:42:25,595
Jo Minwoo.

568
00:42:26,021 --> 00:42:27,720
I see you're hard at work.

569
00:42:28,062 --> 00:42:30,856
Crushing that rock bed,
and throwing it all away.

570
00:42:30,969 --> 00:42:34,408
I hear you're busy hoarding
aggregate, these days?

571
00:42:34,565 --> 00:42:38,999
If you want to buy any, 
you'll have to pay it on the double.

572
00:42:39,114 --> 00:42:42,420
You shouldn't laugh in the
face of business ethics like that.

573
00:42:46,161 --> 00:42:48,200
Business ethics?!

574
00:42:49,452 --> 00:42:52,835
Know business ethics
that can't be topped?

575
00:42:53,102 --> 00:42:56,679
Selling quality apartments 
at the right price.

576
00:42:57,128 --> 00:43:01,541
There's a way to sell quality
apartment at cheap prices, too.

577
00:43:01,827 --> 00:43:03,866
Wish you luck.

578
00:43:19,239 --> 00:43:22,776
Looks like he still has no intention 
of giving up the construction.

579
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:25,375
He's always been a blockhead.

580
00:43:25,483 --> 00:43:28,293
And that's what
will ruin him in the end.

581
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:23,382
Because of Manbo Construction,
aggregate is twice more expensive.

582
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:26,006
Isn't this excessive, Chairman Jo?

583
00:44:26,292 --> 00:44:28,758
Are you implying that it's my fault?

584
00:44:29,084 --> 00:44:30,929
Listen, Chairman Jo.

585
00:44:31,212 --> 00:44:34,885
Isn't that happening because
you're hoarding it all for yourself?

586
00:44:35,042 --> 00:44:36,981
Let's not do this to
each other, Chairman Jo.

587
00:44:37,181 --> 00:44:39,263
You disappoint me.

588
00:44:39,448 --> 00:44:41,595
What?

589
00:44:41,722 --> 00:44:49,073
I thought at least you could distinguish
between cooperation and competition.

590
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:51,498
Listen, Chairman Jo...

591
00:44:51,907 --> 00:44:55,006
We might be fellow committee members,

592
00:44:55,234 --> 00:45:00,352
but do I really have to witness someone
who could be my son lecture me?

593
00:45:00,478 --> 00:45:06,806
It sounds to me like you're looking
down on me for being young?!

594
00:45:06,963 --> 00:45:09,830
Ahh... What...
What did you say?

595
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:12,525
Let me be clear.

596
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:16,218
I didn't come here to
grovel at your feet in deference.

597
00:45:16,930 --> 00:45:22,086
If you have any qualms about me, 
file an official complaint.

598
00:45:22,429 --> 00:45:23,641
<i>You...</i>

599
00:45:23,783 --> 00:45:26,921
You really...

600
00:45:27,135 --> 00:45:29,254
My!

601
00:45:42,066 --> 00:45:43,702
What brings you here?

602
00:45:43,809 --> 00:45:46,917
Nothing that should
concern you, so keep going.

603
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:50,405
So you still haven't
given up the construction?

604
00:45:50,519 --> 00:45:53,986
You know me.
I don't give up so easily.

605
00:45:54,091 --> 00:45:55,482
I sure do.

606
00:45:55,710 --> 00:45:59,003
But, can you really handle it?

607
00:45:59,581 --> 00:46:02,526
You should be running
out of money by now...

608
00:46:02,697 --> 00:46:04,394
How about you call it
quits while you still can?

609
00:46:04,465 --> 00:46:10,092
If you think money can only come out of
a bank's vault, you're sorely mistaken.

610
00:46:10,282 --> 00:46:11,076
What?

611
00:46:11,161 --> 00:46:16,024
Sometimes it can come out of this.

612
00:46:17,616 --> 00:46:20,388
<i>And even out of here.</i>

613
00:46:21,628 --> 00:46:23,139
<i>Why...</i>

614
00:46:23,347 --> 00:46:28,096
Going to sue him for assault again?

615
00:46:28,366 --> 00:46:34,741
He's so good at this, might
get himself a three-week prognosis.

616
00:46:35,121 --> 00:46:37,236
Hey, Lee Gangmo...

617
00:46:38,051 --> 00:46:40,425
Seems like you still haven't
quite figured me out yet...

618
00:46:40,482 --> 00:46:41,993
<i>I sure have.</i>

619
00:46:42,122 --> 00:46:44,218
I know that you're 
weaker than the weak,

620
00:46:44,418 --> 00:46:46,999
and more afraid 
than the biggest cowards.

621
00:46:47,141 --> 00:46:47,797
What?

622
00:46:47,883 --> 00:46:53,308
Because using power and money
to walk over weak people...

623
00:46:53,775 --> 00:46:59,205
is something that only the weakest,
most miserable coward would resort to.

624
00:47:08,633 --> 00:47:12,761
Have you noticed anything
strange about them as of late?

625
00:47:12,903 --> 00:47:14,515
I can't say...

626
00:47:14,904 --> 00:47:19,320
Other than the fact that they're
going ahead with the construction...

627
00:47:21,057 --> 00:47:22,643
<i>He's got no respect.</i>

628
00:47:22,757 --> 00:47:24,126
Tell me about it!

629
00:47:24,226 --> 00:47:27,006
Look at how he uses his father's
influence to indulge his arrogance.

630
00:47:27,148 --> 00:47:29,772
But the real issue is
our lack of aggregate.

631
00:47:29,886 --> 00:47:31,751
Can't be helped.

632
00:47:31,864 --> 00:47:36,569
If Manbo Construction is paying twice
the price, we'll have to do the same.

633
00:47:36,743 --> 00:47:39,052
<i>You don't need to.</i>

634
00:47:40,104 --> 00:47:42,939
<i>President Lee, 
what are you doing here?</i>

635
00:47:47,339 --> 00:47:51,351
I will sell you the aggregate 
for your apartment construction.

636
00:47:52,121 --> 00:47:57,212
On the condition that you won't
give me a penny over market value.

637
00:48:02,667 --> 00:48:05,975
What is that supposed to mean?

638
00:48:06,261 --> 00:48:10,171
Are you telling me Hangang
Construction is selling aggregate?

639
00:48:10,278 --> 00:48:11,416
Yes.

640
00:48:11,523 --> 00:48:15,639
You won't face any more difficulties
because of aggregate shortages.

641
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:19,560
<i>Can we really trust you on this?</i>

642
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:21,322
Yes.

643
00:48:41,094 --> 00:48:43,233
The sister you were loo...

644
00:48:43,461 --> 00:48:47,277
Chanseong, still haven't gone home?

645
00:48:47,676 --> 00:48:49,986
No need to hide it from me as well.

646
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:54,122
I know what is in that account.

647
00:48:54,635 --> 00:48:55,548
Chanseong.

648
00:48:55,690 --> 00:48:58,644
I'm against this.

649
00:48:58,771 --> 00:49:00,450
Because not only Jo Pilyeon,

650
00:49:00,592 --> 00:49:02,360
but you will risk your life as well.

651
00:49:02,474 --> 00:49:03,858
I already have a plan in mind.

652
00:49:03,957 --> 00:49:04,799
Seonbaenim...

653
00:49:04,941 --> 00:49:07,323
I'm not suggesting I'll do
anything with this right away.

654
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:10,965
<i>Under the current regime,
it would be useless.</i>

655
00:49:11,729 --> 00:49:14,412
But things will change for sure.

656
00:49:14,509 --> 00:49:20,512
We will soon live in a world where
Jo Pilyeon can no longer dominate.

657
00:49:23,279 --> 00:49:25,218
I'm sorry, Chanseong.

658
00:49:25,432 --> 00:49:27,870
The only reason I'm hiding it from you,

659
00:49:28,156 --> 00:49:29,667
is that in case they find out...

660
00:49:29,724 --> 00:49:33,340
I jumped on the same boat with you.

661
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:37,473
I have no intention of taking the 
easy way out, if this can kill you.

662
00:49:40,061 --> 00:49:43,554
But, what were you trying
to tell me on your way in?

663
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:44,703
Ahh... Right...

664
00:49:44,845 --> 00:49:46,582
I can't really speak with certainty,

665
00:49:46,682 --> 00:49:49,591
but someone claims to
have seen Miju in Seoul.

666
00:49:49,762 --> 00:49:51,106
Where is that?

667
00:49:51,218 --> 00:49:53,398
I think they said Hannam-Dong?!

668
00:49:53,612 --> 00:49:55,679
Hannam-Dong?!

669
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:59,544
In this case, matching these
with your clothes won't be easy.

670
00:49:59,687 --> 00:50:01,435
So how about these?

671
00:50:01,545 --> 00:50:03,070
They look all right?!

672
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:04,454
- Try them on.
- Yes.

673
00:50:04,539 --> 00:50:05,295
Excuse me?

674
00:50:05,437 --> 00:50:07,733
Yes.
Just a moment.

675
00:50:07,984 --> 00:50:11,940
- Can I try these?
- Please sit here and take off your shoes.

676
00:50:18,330 --> 00:50:19,997
I guess you live alone?

677
00:50:20,109 --> 00:50:21,508
What?

678
00:50:22,834 --> 00:50:24,874
I apologize.

679
00:50:31,196 --> 00:50:33,318
By any chance,

680
00:50:34,522 --> 00:50:37,145
have we ever met before?

681
00:50:38,372 --> 00:50:40,012
What?

682
00:50:41,609 --> 00:50:45,302
I don't think you ever came here?

683
00:50:49,497 --> 00:50:50,666
They fit just right.

684
00:50:50,766 --> 00:50:51,864
How do they feel?

685
00:50:52,007 --> 00:50:55,101
Quite comfortable.

686
00:50:55,229 --> 00:50:56,399
I'll take these.

687
00:50:56,513 --> 00:50:58,495
I'll wrap them up for you.

688
00:50:58,609 --> 00:50:59,465
<i>Deputy Mayor.</i>

689
00:50:59,607 --> 00:51:00,791
You'll be late for your meeting.

690
00:51:00,933 --> 00:51:02,961
Is it time already?

691
00:51:03,052 --> 00:51:05,028
Can you keep these for me?

692
00:51:05,128 --> 00:51:06,397
I'll come buy them later.

693
00:51:06,511 --> 00:51:08,294
Yes.

694
00:51:12,349 --> 00:51:14,397
Deputy Mayor?!

695
00:51:17,141 --> 00:51:19,844
- Excuse me?
- Yes.

696
00:51:44,614 --> 00:51:51,858
<i>- Turning a Crisis into an Opportunity -</i>

697
00:51:54,464 --> 00:51:55,753
Minwoo, you!

698
00:51:55,843 --> 00:51:58,234
I told you not to let
your guard down, didn't I?

699
00:51:58,338 --> 00:52:02,146
You can't even handle Lee Gangmo?

700
00:52:02,387 --> 00:52:06,514
I'm sure you're not implying
that you're afraid of Lee Gangmo.

701
00:52:06,684 --> 00:52:09,121
Aren't you taking
that a little too seriously?

702
00:52:09,227 --> 00:52:10,402
What?

703
00:52:10,508 --> 00:52:15,475
If he saw you in this state,
Lee Gangmo would dance in jubilation.

704
00:52:15,577 --> 00:52:17,840
Minwoo, you little...

705
00:52:18,137 --> 00:52:21,459
I'm not going to 
make any more mistakes.

706
00:52:21,831 --> 00:52:26,565
Isn't destroying him 
all that I need to do?

707
00:52:32,356 --> 00:52:36,452
I'll have to teach Minwoo a lesson.

708
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:38,323
Let him be.

709
00:52:38,429 --> 00:52:41,468
That verve of his only reassures me.

710
00:52:41,579 --> 00:52:42,965
What?

711
00:52:43,744 --> 00:52:48,592
Lee Gangmo is the scariest
man I've ever seen.

712
00:52:48,804 --> 00:52:50,945
If he's going to face
someone like him,

713
00:52:51,088 --> 00:52:54,039
that's how he should act.

714
00:53:08,737 --> 00:53:10,835
Lee Gangmo...

715
00:53:11,407 --> 00:53:13,591
Lee Gangmo!!

716
00:53:21,435 --> 00:53:25,727
We appreciate your prompt payment.

717
00:53:26,411 --> 00:53:30,140
Here is your receipt.

718
00:53:30,973 --> 00:53:32,558
Thank you, President Lee.

719
00:53:32,715 --> 00:53:38,099
Thanks to you, our company has 
signed export contracts overseas.

720
00:53:38,238 --> 00:53:39,616
I should be the one saying that.

721
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:41,228
Thank you.

722
00:53:41,385 --> 00:53:44,142
Actually,

723
00:53:44,308 --> 00:53:47,658
you should extend your
gratitude to someone else.

724
00:53:48,041 --> 00:53:49,219
Excuse me?

725
00:53:49,390 --> 00:53:53,240
I didn't send you that sample.

726
00:53:54,153 --> 00:53:56,121
Then, who...

727
00:53:56,363 --> 00:54:01,707
It was Director Hwang Jeongyeon.

728
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:10,163
She asked me not to tell you,

729
00:54:10,349 --> 00:54:16,655
but she was the one who
sent me your way as well.

730
00:54:18,504 --> 00:54:21,936
You really have a nice friend.

731
00:54:22,093 --> 00:54:25,687
Aigoo... I envy you, President Lee.

732
00:54:25,815 --> 00:54:27,954
Gangmo...

733
00:54:54,813 --> 00:55:00,063
Where did you go buy that chicken?
All the way to the...

734
00:55:01,097 --> 00:55:02,081
Gyeongok, it's you?

735
00:55:02,238 --> 00:55:05,931
I asked Director Ju to buy me a...

736
00:55:06,634 --> 00:55:08,298
And you...

737
00:55:10,405 --> 00:55:13,104
Hey... What do you think you're doing?

738
00:55:13,232 --> 00:55:14,359
Let her go!

739
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:16,449
What is this...

740
00:55:16,882 --> 00:55:18,710
Did you two move in together?

741
00:55:18,809 --> 00:55:19,765
Hey!

742
00:55:19,893 --> 00:55:21,918
Oh Namsuk, you...

743
00:55:23,387 --> 00:55:25,540
What are you doing?

744
00:55:28,581 --> 00:55:31,900
How did you find this place?

745
00:55:33,967 --> 00:55:35,930
How long has this been going on?

746
00:55:36,029 --> 00:55:37,484
How long?!

747
00:55:37,570 --> 00:55:39,480
How miserable...

748
00:55:39,623 --> 00:55:42,489
I should have smelled something was up...

749
00:55:44,165 --> 00:55:47,780
You must love the fact we got divorced?!

750
00:55:47,955 --> 00:55:49,779
No need to hide it from me now.

751
00:55:49,922 --> 00:55:51,215
It's my house.

752
00:55:51,313 --> 00:55:52,061
Get out of here.

753
00:55:52,132 --> 00:55:53,274
Sure!

754
00:55:53,388 --> 00:55:54,745
I'm sure it is.

755
00:55:54,849 --> 00:55:57,066
And he must be your partner.

756
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:58,820
Ahh!

757
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:03,312
Don't tell me you're
Jeongyeon's mother?!

758
00:56:07,198 --> 00:56:08,439
You really!

759
00:56:08,510 --> 00:56:10,150
Because if such wasn't the case,

760
00:56:10,321 --> 00:56:14,129
I can't really figure out why you'd stick
to someone who was as good as dead.

761
00:56:14,243 --> 00:56:16,239
<i>Think everyone is like you?</i>

762
00:56:16,439 --> 00:56:18,264
You have no right to act like this!

763
00:56:18,393 --> 00:56:19,120
Get out!

764
00:56:19,177 --> 00:56:21,185
Why would I have no right?

765
00:56:21,297 --> 00:56:22,871
You're Jeongshik's father.

766
00:56:22,961 --> 00:56:25,301
You're the father of my child!

767
00:56:26,374 --> 00:56:29,626
Do you even know in
what state your son is?

768
00:56:29,768 --> 00:56:30,776
Why...

769
00:56:30,886 --> 00:56:31,936
What's wrong with Jeongshik?

770
00:56:32,050 --> 00:56:33,676
I'm well aware...

771
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:36,878
that I'm the first to blame
for spoiling him so much.

772
00:56:37,092 --> 00:56:39,842
<i>But you ruined him just as much...</i>

773
00:56:39,950 --> 00:56:43,281
No, even worse than me!

774
00:56:43,409 --> 00:56:46,233
What on earth could have
possibly happened to him?

775
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:47,958
Jeongshik...

776
00:56:49,028 --> 00:56:52,985
has completely lost all
reason, gambling all day.

777
00:56:53,103 --> 00:56:55,754
He gave up on himself, my Jeongshik!

778
00:56:55,952 --> 00:56:57,661
Say what?!

779
00:56:58,786 --> 00:56:59,859
Honey...

780
00:57:00,030 --> 00:57:02,967
I beg you, make him stop...

781
00:57:03,559 --> 00:57:06,490
You know that 
I can't live without him!

782
00:57:06,572 --> 00:57:08,468
Honey... Honey...

783
00:57:08,753 --> 00:57:11,334
<i>I beg you, help my Jeongshik...</i>

784
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:13,917
<i>He's your son as well!</i>

785
00:57:14,010 --> 00:57:15,641
<i>Honey...</i>

786
00:57:15,755 --> 00:57:19,078
<i>Help our poor son out...</i>

787
00:57:25,868 --> 00:57:27,194
Call.

788
00:57:28,291 --> 00:57:30,019
Bounty.

789
00:57:30,423 --> 00:57:32,295
<i>Flush.</i>

790
00:57:34,265 --> 00:57:36,919
<i>Sorry, man...</i>

791
00:57:41,358 --> 00:57:43,315
<i>Another round.</i>

792
00:57:46,479 --> 00:57:47,393
<i>Two million.</i>

793
00:57:47,493 --> 00:57:50,787
Two and raise another five.

794
00:57:52,669 --> 00:57:55,293
Hey... here you go, full!

795
00:58:07,799 --> 00:58:11,263
- Let's hear it.
- Plate is mine.

796
00:58:11,887 --> 00:58:13,149
<i>Already lost everything?</i>

797
00:58:13,248 --> 00:58:15,288
You seemed to be in good form today.

798
00:58:15,387 --> 00:58:17,355
Hey, tail.

799
00:58:19,030 --> 00:58:20,247
Did you ask for me?

800
00:58:20,341 --> 00:58:22,147
Hit me with another ten million.

801
00:58:22,261 --> 00:58:24,656
But it doesn't really look like your day?

802
00:58:24,785 --> 00:58:27,708
- Why don't you stop for today?
- Just do it!

803
00:58:30,768 --> 00:58:32,779
Let's go ahead.

804
00:58:36,253 --> 00:58:37,242
Here...

805
00:58:37,370 --> 00:58:38,982
You know this is a private loan, right?

806
00:58:39,067 --> 00:58:41,671
<i>Seal here.</i>

807
00:58:49,569 --> 00:58:52,093
Just a moment.

808
00:58:58,952 --> 00:59:01,053
You said he's Hwang Jeongyeon's 
half-brother, right?

809
00:59:01,196 --> 00:59:02,878
Yes, Hyungnim.

810
00:59:03,891 --> 00:59:05,787
Bring me another ten million.

811
00:59:09,367 --> 00:59:13,602
While we're at it, let's deal
with all the Hwangs in one strike.

812
00:59:16,277 --> 00:59:19,243
Things are getting 
even more interesting...

813
00:59:26,872 --> 00:59:29,739
Why don't we go for a snack?

814
00:59:29,888 --> 00:59:34,149
I'll go meet my friends, 
so I'll be late.

815
00:59:34,243 --> 00:59:36,278
Don't be too late,
and don't get drunk.

816
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:38,474
All right.

817
00:59:38,591 --> 00:59:40,513
You must be back before the last bus.

818
00:59:40,639 --> 00:59:43,251
I said all right.

819
00:59:43,928 --> 00:59:46,084
What will you go for?

820
00:59:46,796 --> 00:59:50,095
<i>Chicken feet and soju?</i>

821
01:00:08,091 --> 01:00:09,529
- Come on in.
- Good evening.

822
01:00:09,629 --> 01:00:12,095
- Some noodle soup, please.
- Yes.

823
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:42,561
- You have noodle soup?
- Yes, sure.

824
01:00:56,304 --> 01:00:58,557
I hear you opened a business?

825
01:00:59,895 --> 01:01:01,637
Going well?

826
01:01:03,988 --> 01:01:05,530
Yeah...

827
01:01:05,904 --> 01:01:07,865
Not too bad.

828
01:01:10,130 --> 01:01:11,812
And you?

829
01:01:13,295 --> 01:01:15,449
I've been busy.

830
01:01:26,684 --> 01:01:28,585
Enjoy your meal.

831
01:01:29,383 --> 01:01:30,838
<i>Come on in.</i>

832
01:01:31,095 --> 01:01:33,091
Noodle soup, please.

833
01:01:35,030 --> 01:01:37,112
Having dinner now?

834
01:01:39,987 --> 01:01:43,100
Thanks to you, everything went well.

835
01:01:43,770 --> 01:01:46,875
I'll come pay back 
the principal tomorrow.

836
01:01:47,043 --> 01:01:48,215
No need to come firsthand.

837
01:01:48,315 --> 01:01:49,656
Just wire it to my account.

838
01:01:49,770 --> 01:01:53,449
No, I'll be in the neighborhood anyway.

839
01:01:56,483 --> 01:01:58,130
<i>Right...</i>

840
01:01:59,157 --> 01:02:02,152
Are you free in the afternoon?

841
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:06,458
This friend from the States 
brought me a few gifts,

842
01:02:06,629 --> 01:02:09,014
but it's all stuff for women, so...

843
01:02:22,738 --> 01:02:24,364
Ever since you were little,

844
01:02:24,521 --> 01:02:27,010
you always liked fish cake.

845

851
01:03:00,206 --> 01:03:02,296
They're selling this from France?!

852
01:03:02,410 --> 01:03:03,494
It's a gas boiler company.

853
01:03:03,579 --> 01:03:07,729
If we sell these with our
apartments, it's game over.

854
01:03:07,893 --> 01:03:08,713
Go ahead.

855
01:03:08,798 --> 01:03:12,227
<i>I'll show you what dealing
with a rabid dog feels like.</i>

856
01:03:12,413 --> 01:03:15,065
If we manage to acquire Beaute,
I'll generously reward you.

857
01:03:15,194 --> 01:03:16,277
I have a condition.

858
01:03:16,377 --> 01:03:19,272
I will join this acquisition 
as a shareholder.

859
01:03:19,386 --> 01:03:22,024
We're the only ones
who know the bidding price.

860
01:03:22,152 --> 01:03:24,420
It must remain secret.

861
01:03:24,755 --> 01:03:26,223
<i>Let's hear the bidding price.</i>

862
01:03:26,366 --> 01:03:29,033
Show me the money first.
