Final Episode

4
00:00:12,109 --> 00:00:14,565
We will now resume our hearing.

5
00:00:14,768 --> 00:00:18,099
Congressman Oh Segwang of the
DLP, you may begin your inquiries.

6
00:00:18,743 --> 00:00:22,952
Witness, you clearly talked
of a secret fund account, right?

7
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:24,131
Yes.

8
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:27,414
Fund which would belong
to the former president?

9
00:00:27,617 --> 00:00:28,923
That's correct.

10
00:00:32,524 --> 00:00:36,251
Do you have that account, by any chance?

11
00:00:37,937 --> 00:00:39,737
You're in congress.

12
00:00:39,863 --> 00:00:41,866
A single false statement,

13
00:00:41,968 --> 00:00:45,652
and you'll be accused of
perjury and contempt of congress.

14
00:00:48,758 --> 00:00:50,216
Witness.

15
00:00:51,091 --> 00:00:52,980
I'd like an answer.

16
00:00:53,715 --> 00:00:55,768
I will ask the chairman, if I may.

17
00:00:57,581 --> 00:01:02,481
You saw that account
as well, didn't you?

18
00:01:09,465 --> 00:01:16,100
Answer with a lie, and you
will insult the entire country in the process.

19
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:19,358
I hope your conscience
will suggest the right answer.

20
00:01:23,706 --> 00:01:25,879
Right as the witness suggested,

21
00:01:27,567 --> 00:01:32,154
I did see that secret fund account.

22
00:01:37,953 --> 00:01:40,123
And it wasn't just the chairman,

23
00:01:40,368 --> 00:01:44,877
but also a few other gentlemen at the
1987 Olympic Support Committee event.

24
00:01:46,626 --> 00:01:49,415
And they're all sitting here today.

25
00:01:52,082 --> 00:01:54,110
Chairman.

26
00:01:55,085 --> 00:01:57,736
Not only because of this secret fund issue,

27
00:01:58,423 --> 00:02:03,529
but to bring to light all of
candidate Jo Pilyeon's past actions,

28
00:02:03,909 --> 00:02:07,174
one day of hearing alone can't suffice.

29
00:02:07,481 --> 00:02:09,380
I motion for an extension.

30
00:02:09,469 --> 00:02:12,535
Ahh... I concur.

31
00:02:12,993 --> 00:02:15,390
I do as well.

32
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,865
What are you waiting for?

33
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:37,983
Lee Gangmo is doing his
damnedest to find Lee Seongmo!

34
00:02:38,104 --> 00:02:41,416
Whatever it takes,
we must find him before he does!

35
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:44,881
So, what, am I supposed to
make him appear out of the blue?

36
00:02:44,988 --> 00:02:46,474
You little...

37
00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:49,278
Anyhow,

38
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:52,728
you must find him whatever it takes.

39
00:02:52,867 --> 00:02:54,719
Did I make myself clear?

40
00:02:55,149 --> 00:02:57,784
I will soon bring you good news,

41
00:02:57,893 --> 00:02:59,471
so just wait.

42
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:00,727
Right...

43
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,840
I enjoyed the hearing.

44
00:03:04,369 --> 00:03:06,727
I'll call you again soon.

45
00:03:09,429 --> 00:03:11,657
You're not going to
hand Lee Seongmo to him?

46
00:03:11,766 --> 00:03:15,026
We don't even know whether
he will become prime minister,

47
00:03:15,156 --> 00:03:17,998
can't give up such precious goods so easily.

48
00:03:18,597 --> 00:03:21,052
What most matters in a deal...

49
00:03:21,275 --> 00:03:23,667
is none other than timing.

50
00:03:24,207 --> 00:03:26,063
You just wait.

51
00:03:26,447 --> 00:03:31,196
Lee Seongmo will bring us a
huge opportunity on a silver platter.

52
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:45,817
Please, give him a warm applause.

53
00:04:01,648 --> 00:04:04,756
You could consider Manbo Plaza
the culmination of thirty years...

54
00:04:04,842 --> 00:04:08,350
of evolution and development
shown by Manbo Construction.

55
00:04:08,562 --> 00:04:09,889
If you allow me the bold assertion,

56
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,498
I am confident this will prove to be
an epochal turning point...

57
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,119
in the history of Gangnam's development.

58
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:15,386
We've heard that the sale
has been completed already.

59
00:04:15,468 --> 00:04:17,760
All buyers will move in starting next month.

60
00:04:17,976 --> 00:04:20,549
That should be all for today.

61
00:04:20,737 --> 00:04:23,858
Our PR reps will show you each floor.

62
00:04:33,844 --> 00:04:35,277
You must be busy,

63
00:04:35,383 --> 00:04:37,169
so allow me once again to
extend you my gratitude, Mayor.

64
00:04:37,263 --> 00:04:41,471
Among the invited I see
many wives of congressmen.

65
00:04:41,575 --> 00:04:45,049
Since they'll become our
department store's first customers.

66
00:04:45,425 --> 00:04:46,740
Yes...

67
00:04:47,088 --> 00:04:52,934
But you completed construction
a lot earlier than expected,

68
00:04:53,046 --> 00:04:57,437
was it by any chance because
of your father's cabinet hearing?

69
00:04:57,578 --> 00:05:03,886
You could think of it as another proof of Manbo Construction's technological supremacy.

70
00:05:05,369 --> 00:05:06,776
If you'll excuse me.

71
00:05:34,638 --> 00:05:37,200
Did you hear that?

72
00:05:37,576 --> 00:05:41,014
Sounded like a piano or something...

73
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:43,320
I'm sure it's nothing serious.

74
00:06:17,985 --> 00:06:19,652
Gangmo.

75
00:06:23,611 --> 00:06:26,195
Director Go from Sokcho just called me.

76
00:06:26,312 --> 00:06:27,392
Did they find him?

77
00:06:27,491 --> 00:06:32,009
They couldn't, but there are
rumors that he's with Jeongshik.

78
00:06:59,812 --> 00:07:01,371
- You're back, President?
- Yeah.

79
00:07:01,465 --> 00:07:04,631
- Everything in order?
- He's quieter than you'd think.

80
00:07:05,877 --> 00:07:08,280
Need to take good care of him.

81
00:07:08,393 --> 00:07:10,827
We're dealing with precious goods here.

82
00:07:14,895 --> 00:07:16,928
The hell?
A vest...

83
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:18,444
Hey...

84
00:07:18,808 --> 00:07:20,927
Let's take off that vest.

85
00:07:22,971 --> 00:07:26,009
You look like you
wouldn't be afraid of anything...

86
00:07:26,096 --> 00:07:28,633
This is not real, is it?

87
00:07:28,762 --> 00:07:29,913
Uh?

88
00:07:31,463 --> 00:07:33,767
I said take it off.

89
00:07:35,059 --> 00:07:36,890
President, are you all right?

90
00:07:39,252 --> 00:07:40,545
Ahh... You little...

91
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,806
He sure is strong.

92
00:07:42,936 --> 00:07:47,297
Why, are you hiding
some gold inside that...

93
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,322
Hey.

94
00:07:53,546 --> 00:07:54,438
Take it off of him.

95
00:07:54,556 --> 00:07:56,153
- What?
- Take off the damn vest!

96
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,680
Do it.

97
00:08:08,343 --> 00:08:09,955
Enough.

98
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,811
Open it up.

99
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:21,329
There's something inside.

100
00:08:27,123 --> 00:08:28,938
What is this?

101
00:08:33,133 --> 00:08:34,625
This!

102
00:08:34,942 --> 00:08:36,586
Is a treasure map!

103
00:08:36,739 --> 00:08:39,950
It's a goldmine... A goldmine!

104
00:08:43,274 --> 00:08:45,517
What are you doing? Stop him!

105
00:08:49,993 --> 00:08:52,334
Take that account from him!

106
00:08:57,397 --> 00:08:58,337
Hyung!

107
00:08:58,442 --> 00:09:00,944
Hey... Stop them!

108
00:09:08,428 --> 00:09:09,603
Hwang Jeongshik!

109
00:09:09,673 --> 00:09:11,423
Park Sotae...
Long time no see!

110
00:09:11,494 --> 00:09:13,127
Long time no see, you prick!

111
00:09:16,216 --> 00:09:18,252
Stop there!

112
00:09:35,424 --> 00:09:37,339
It's me, Hyung.

113
00:09:45,867 --> 00:09:48,296
I'm Gangmo, Hyung!

114
00:09:50,998 --> 00:09:52,994
Look at me...

115
00:09:54,063 --> 00:09:56,890
I'm your brother Gangmo!

116
00:10:04,347 --> 00:10:06,052
Hyung...

117
00:10:23,582 --> 00:10:25,620
Hyung!

118
00:10:28,732 --> 00:10:31,281
I'm sorry, Hyung...

119
00:10:37,657 --> 00:10:39,717
Hyung...

120
00:10:51,194 --> 00:10:54,847
I'm sorry... I'm sorry.

121
00:11:09,775 --> 00:11:12,272
I'm sorry, Hyung.

122
00:11:17,792 --> 00:11:20,752
Congressman Hwang Taeseop,
you may begin your inquiry.

123
00:11:21,211 --> 00:11:22,373
Yes.

124
00:11:23,023 --> 00:11:26,085
First, before I go ahead,

125
00:11:26,426 --> 00:11:29,508
I'd like to tell you my story.

126
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:34,594
Back when Gangnam was moving
its first steps in terms of development,

127
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:39,622
I was facing financial woes.

128
00:11:40,087 --> 00:11:42,300
I needed money so badly...

129
00:11:42,783 --> 00:11:45,834
that I would have done
practically everything for it.

130
00:11:46,222 --> 00:11:52,999
And that is when a devil approached me,
whispering sweet words in my ears.

131
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:59,413
He told me to kill my very best
friend with my own hands,

132
00:11:59,544 --> 00:12:03,147
and steal a cargo of smuggled gold bars.

133
00:12:07,109 --> 00:12:14,238
And then I let the
devil lure me into his trap.

134
00:12:15,156 --> 00:12:19,714
I took the gun he gave me,
and went out prepared to kill a man.

135
00:12:22,413 --> 00:12:23,776
Chairman!

136
00:12:23,905 --> 00:12:26,442
Last I checked, this was a cabinet hearing.

137
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,475
Congressman Hwang, you may continue.

138
00:12:30,473 --> 00:12:32,316
To be perfectly honest,

139
00:12:32,832 --> 00:12:35,702
I have no right to be here.

140
00:12:35,828 --> 00:12:37,587
Because it was what I did...

141
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:43,859
that caused my dear friend's death.

142
00:12:43,977 --> 00:12:45,074
Look, Chairman!

143
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,630
Candidate, you just stay put!

144
00:12:52,853 --> 00:12:57,667
And the person who pulled the
trigger and killed my friend instead...

145
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,475
was none other than...

146
00:13:00,975 --> 00:13:03,202
Jo Pilyeon!

147
00:13:06,596 --> 00:13:08,499
Congressman Hwang!

148
00:13:13,714 --> 00:13:16,535
Don't let him deceive
you, ladies and gentlemen!

149
00:13:16,793 --> 00:13:21,762
He's trying to falsely incriminate
me without a shred of evidence!

150
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:26,789
This is a travesty against the entire country!

151
00:13:29,587 --> 00:13:31,173
Chairman.

152
00:13:31,723 --> 00:13:36,259
With this cabinet
hearing as my last act of duty,

153
00:13:39,607 --> 00:13:45,559
I resign from congress.

154
00:13:48,213 --> 00:13:49,975
Jo Pilyeon,

155
00:13:50,813 --> 00:13:52,841
you're a cold-blooded killer.

156
00:13:53,652 --> 00:13:55,484
You killed my friend,

157
00:13:55,613 --> 00:13:58,009
and even tried to strangle me to death!

158
00:13:58,103 --> 00:13:59,689
And not satisfied with that!

159
00:13:59,771 --> 00:14:03,048
You went ahead and killed
Congressman Oh Byeongtak as well!

160
00:14:04,951 --> 00:14:08,568
It's a lie! This is a conspiracy against me!

161
00:14:08,979 --> 00:14:11,493
My rights are being trampled on!

162
00:14:13,044 --> 00:14:15,123
It's not a lie!

163
00:14:33,902 --> 00:14:41,337
The only one who is lying...

164
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:48,267
is Jo Pilyeon.

165
00:15:17,304 --> 00:15:19,109
And the man...

166
00:15:21,482 --> 00:15:24,383
Jo Pilyeon shot to death back then...

167
00:15:27,017 --> 00:15:29,149
was my father.

168
00:15:35,981 --> 00:15:37,283
You...

169
00:15:37,734 --> 00:15:39,188
Shut that goddamned mouth of yours!

170
00:15:39,235 --> 00:15:41,866
And five years ago,

171
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:45,660
Congressman Oh Byeongtak
was killed by Jo Pilyeon!

172
00:15:45,754 --> 00:15:48,224
What are you waiting for?

173
00:15:48,444 --> 00:15:52,297
Over there!
Get these people out of here!

174
00:15:54,672 --> 00:15:56,593
Quiet!

175
00:15:56,898 --> 00:16:00,975
To destroy any evidence, you even
had their bodies cremated.

176
00:16:03,326 --> 00:16:07,553
However, despite having
meticulously planned all that,

177
00:16:07,788 --> 00:16:11,500
- you made a fatal mistake.
- Don't make me laugh!

178
00:16:11,829 --> 00:16:14,002
There could be no mistake whatsoever,

179
00:16:14,119 --> 00:16:16,480
since my plan was flawless.

180
00:16:17,455 --> 00:16:20,862
So you finally admitted it.

181
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:21,994
What?!

182
00:16:22,171 --> 00:16:28,361
You've just admitted that
you killed Congressman Oh Byeongtak.

183
00:16:32,426 --> 00:16:34,752
So you'll kill me?!

184
00:16:35,231 --> 00:16:40,261
Since if I do, any
evidence will be buried along with you.

185
00:16:40,355 --> 00:16:43,656
Will killing me really get rid of it?

186
00:16:43,738 --> 00:16:46,601
Who else... Lee Seongmo?

187
00:16:48,072 --> 00:16:52,806
That fool had the guts to
write that secret fund account.

188
00:16:52,935 --> 00:16:58,792
Even if I get rid of him,
who will ever blame me for it?

189
00:17:20,263 --> 00:17:21,866
And this!

190
00:17:22,591 --> 00:17:24,934
Is the secret fund account...

191
00:17:25,053 --> 00:17:27,513
that Jo Pilyeon wrote.

192
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:05,956
Chairman Jo really built one hell of a place.

193
00:18:12,605 --> 00:18:17,579
Are you the one who
invested in my films all this time?

194
00:18:17,798 --> 00:18:21,433
And what makes you
believe I'd waste my money that way?

195
00:18:22,889 --> 00:18:26,448
Does the film we're featuring
starting today star Cha Soojeong?

196
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:29,421
Yes. There is a press screening at seven.

197
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:33,371
I'm sure you added a clause allowing us
to end its theater run in the case of a flop?

198
00:18:33,462 --> 00:18:35,029
Yes, Chairman.

199
00:18:35,921 --> 00:18:40,796
Unless you want to see your film gone,
better focus on improving box office.

200
00:18:54,476 --> 00:18:59,471
Seems like Minwoo has no
feelings left for you whatsoever?!

201
00:19:00,294 --> 00:19:03,570
Then again, it's been so long...

202
00:19:03,711 --> 00:19:06,554
It would be strange if
he was still in love with you.

203
00:19:11,463 --> 00:19:12,835
What's wrong?

204
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,453
And I thought it was a new building...

205
00:19:14,535 --> 00:19:16,779
Go out and see if they
can change the light bulb.

206
00:19:16,884 --> 00:19:18,376
All right.

207
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:41,353
The hearing should be over by now.

208
00:19:41,461 --> 00:19:43,130
Find out how it went.

209
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:44,974
All right, Chairman.

210
00:20:27,354 --> 00:20:29,053
Chairman... Chairman!!

211
00:20:29,136 --> 00:20:30,287
Are you all right?

212
00:20:30,392 --> 00:20:34,116
What on earth is happening?

213
00:20:44,532 --> 00:20:46,035
Yes.

214
00:20:46,341 --> 00:20:48,843
Chairman, where are you now?

215
00:20:48,972 --> 00:20:50,628
In the elevator.

216
00:20:50,781 --> 00:20:52,884
What happened?

217
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,417
It's terrible, Chairman!

218
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:58,553
The building...
The building has collapsed!

219
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:02,807
What are you trying to say?

220
00:21:02,948 --> 00:21:04,369
The building has collapsed?!

221
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,318
Stay there. We'll send
a rescue squad your way.

222
00:21:07,388 --> 00:21:09,233
Look, Chief Kim.

223
00:21:09,395 --> 00:21:10,654
Chief Kim.

224
00:21:10,787 --> 00:21:12,557
Chief Kim!

225
00:21:16,547 --> 00:21:20,944
Are you saying that
Manbo Plaza has collapsed?

226
00:21:25,388 --> 00:21:26,746
Miju...

227
00:21:26,981 --> 00:21:29,424
Miju is still in the
waiting room of the fifth floor.

228
00:21:33,232 --> 00:21:33,942
Chairman!

229
00:21:34,024 --> 00:21:35,575
Open the door!

230
00:21:35,692 --> 00:21:37,536
Open the damn door!

231
00:21:37,689 --> 00:21:39,251
Open...

232
00:21:40,003 --> 00:21:41,956
Chairman, stop!

233
00:21:42,065 --> 00:21:45,133
If you keep this up,
the elevator will crash down!

234
00:21:45,258 --> 00:21:46,385
Miju is inside.

235
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:48,519
Miju is still there!

236
00:21:48,763 --> 00:21:51,218
- Chairman...
- Miju.

237
00:21:51,547 --> 00:21:53,602
Open the door!

238
00:21:58,383 --> 00:21:59,981
Careful...

239
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:05,690
From here on in, Hyung,
you'll live here with me.

240
00:22:06,312 --> 00:22:07,910
All right?

241
00:22:10,682 --> 00:22:13,795
I said be careful.

242
00:22:19,929 --> 00:22:21,080
Ohh... Shideok.

243
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:22,690
When was Miju's
press screening, again?

244
00:22:22,784 --> 00:22:24,452
Seven.

245
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:27,001
It's late, we'll have to hurry.

246
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:28,362
Breaking news.

247
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:33,266
A new five-storey building in
Gangnam, Manbo Plaza, has collapsed.

248
00:22:34,218 --> 00:22:36,203
What are they saying?

249
00:22:36,309 --> 00:22:38,576
The Manbo Plaza collapsed?!

250
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:42,160
What you're now seeing is footage
one of our reporters was able...

251
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:46,001
to shoot on her way to a
press screening for Cha Soojeong's film.

252
00:22:46,142 --> 00:22:48,550
We're at Manbo Plaza,
where Cha Soojeong's new film...

253
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:51,827
is about to be introduced in a press screening.

254
00:22:51,944 --> 00:22:53,972
Manbo Plaza was...

255
00:23:04,274 --> 00:23:06,200
Thankfully, as the press
screening hadn't started yet,

256
00:23:06,271 --> 00:23:07,699
the number of casualties was low,

257
00:23:07,781 --> 00:23:14,429
but famous singer-cum-movie star
Cha Soojeong is still trapped inside.

258
00:23:36,054 --> 00:23:38,932
The building just collapsed!

259
00:23:39,045 --> 00:23:40,976
I know where Miju was.

260
00:23:41,081 --> 00:23:42,420
I must go inside and rescue her.

261
00:23:42,467 --> 00:23:44,682
It's too dangerous to go inside now.

262
00:23:44,786 --> 00:23:48,534
If we waste more time and the
building completely collapses, then Miju will die!

263
00:23:48,841 --> 00:23:51,518
I'll show you the way, so follow me.

264
00:23:51,951 --> 00:23:53,166
Chairman!

265
00:23:53,274 --> 00:23:54,725
Chairman!!

266
00:23:56,267 --> 00:23:58,284
What did you just say?

267
00:23:58,836 --> 00:24:00,011
It collapsed?!

268
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,732
What collapsed?

269
00:24:01,822 --> 00:24:05,246
The Manbo Plaza Minwoo built...

270
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:07,079
Why would a building collapse?

271
00:24:07,189 --> 00:24:09,439
How could it?

272
00:24:11,166 --> 00:24:15,502
The aftermath of Manbo Plaza's
collapse feels like a battlefield.

273
00:24:15,627 --> 00:24:18,259
The prosecutors blame the
accident on faulty construction practices,

274
00:24:18,365 --> 00:24:22,135
and will soon summon Chairman Jo Minwoo
and the officials in charge of the project.

275
00:24:22,229 --> 00:24:26,361
An urgent public statement
by the government is expected...

276
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:30,810
Honey... Minwoo...

277
00:24:30,921 --> 00:24:32,491
What now?

278
00:24:32,584 --> 00:24:34,113
No way.

279
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:36,065
This is all a conspiracy.

280
00:24:36,163 --> 00:24:42,464
Someone... Someone
orchestrated all this to kill me.

281
00:24:42,989 --> 00:24:44,448
Congressman...

282
00:24:44,601 --> 00:24:46,250
It's Lee Gangmo's fault.

283
00:24:46,375 --> 00:24:53,060
In retaliation for killing his father,
Lee Gangmo committed an act of terror.

284
00:24:53,365 --> 00:24:54,469
The gun...

285
00:24:54,628 --> 00:24:55,828
Where is my gun?

286
00:24:55,942 --> 00:24:57,101
- The gun!
- Congressman!

287
00:24:57,171 --> 00:25:00,014
- Honey! Wake up!
- The gun!

288
00:25:00,143 --> 00:25:02,442
- Congressman!
- Honey!

289
00:25:11,413 --> 00:25:12,505
Miju...

290
00:25:12,693 --> 00:25:14,565
Lee Miju!

291
00:25:23,147 --> 00:25:24,384
Miju.

292
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:26,557
Lee Miju!

293
00:25:27,321 --> 00:25:29,177
Lee Miju!

294
00:25:33,651 --> 00:25:34,751
Miju...

295
00:25:35,045 --> 00:25:36,654
Miju!

296
00:25:39,355 --> 00:25:41,084
It's bleeding, you silly!

297
00:25:41,199 --> 00:25:42,804
It's all right.

298
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:44,836
Let's go to the hospital, uh?

299
00:25:45,271 --> 00:25:48,395
The hospital, for so little?
Just a band-aid and...

300
00:25:48,501 --> 00:25:49,429
Get on my back.

301
00:25:49,511 --> 00:25:52,882
I said it's nothing, I'm fine.

302
00:25:56,778 --> 00:25:58,141
I live here, put me down!

303
00:25:58,212 --> 00:26:01,395
Is that the problem now?
Blood is gushing out of there!

304
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:03,470
Gushing?!
I said I'm all right!

305
00:26:03,545 --> 00:26:04,954
Just stay put.

306
00:26:34,828 --> 00:26:36,373
Miju.

307
00:26:38,564 --> 00:26:40,224
I'm her brother.

308
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:41,746
What are her conditions?

309
00:26:41,847 --> 00:26:46,465
Thankfully, other than a cracked
rib, she suffered no serious injuries.

310
00:26:49,018 --> 00:26:50,398
Thank you.

311
00:26:50,626 --> 00:26:51,730
Thank you very much, Doctor.

312
00:26:51,812 --> 00:26:56,100
You shouldn't thank me,
but the man who saved Miss Cha.

313
00:26:56,276 --> 00:27:00,270
If he hadn't found her so quickly,
she could have died due to excessive bleeding.

314
00:27:16,668 --> 00:27:18,092
Miju.

315
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:21,780
Can you hear me?

316
00:27:22,062 --> 00:27:23,648
It's me.

317
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,157
Oppa...

318
00:27:31,176 --> 00:27:33,055
That's right.

319
00:27:37,977 --> 00:27:40,103
Thank God you made it.

320
00:28:12,464 --> 00:28:13,933
Congressman.

321
00:28:14,614 --> 00:28:17,175
Where are we headed?

322
00:28:17,656 --> 00:28:20,240
We... We must hide.

323
00:28:20,392 --> 00:28:22,889
I don't think hiding
will solve the problem.

324
00:28:23,018 --> 00:28:26,847
If they catch us now, it's all over.

325
00:28:26,961 --> 00:28:30,699
We'll have to rot in the
can for the rest of our days.

326
00:28:30,793 --> 00:28:32,509
But, Congressman...

327
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:34,667
I can't die.

328
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:36,809
I can't let them kill me.

329
00:28:37,761 --> 00:28:40,451
There is no way I'm letting them.

330
00:28:41,948 --> 00:28:43,352
Jaechun.

331
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:45,960
Failure is the mother of success.

332
00:28:46,371 --> 00:28:50,335
We might be on the run right now,

333
00:28:50,531 --> 00:28:56,937
but when we make our return,
the earth will tremble in fear and awe.

334
00:28:57,172 --> 00:29:01,293
Jo Pilyeon will make sure it happens.

335
00:29:07,256 --> 00:29:08,935
How do you think it will go?

336
00:29:09,006 --> 00:29:12,083
There might be a chance
for a reduced sentence, but...

337
00:29:12,988 --> 00:29:14,832
But penal servitude is a given?

338
00:29:14,946 --> 00:29:19,562
Embezzlement of public funds and 
professional negligence will still stand.

339
00:29:22,937 --> 00:29:23,998
Chairman.

340
00:29:24,075 --> 00:29:27,268
Creditors have gathered at the office.

341
00:29:31,131 --> 00:29:35,463
So you want Manbo Construction
to be acquired by another company?

342
00:29:35,571 --> 00:29:41,361
With a temporary draft term extension
until the management crisis is resolved,

343
00:29:41,484 --> 00:29:45,014
I think there will be companies interested
in acquiring Manbo Construction.

344
00:29:45,108 --> 00:29:49,149
Any recommendation, Chairman Hwang?

345
00:29:51,909 --> 00:29:56,527
How about President Lee
Gangmo of Hangang Construction?

346
00:29:57,318 --> 00:30:01,765
You're telling us to hand the
company to Hangang Construction?

347
00:30:01,875 --> 00:30:06,397
If we could only leave
management to them, I would approve.

348
00:30:06,609 --> 00:30:08,447
I approve as well.

349
00:30:08,764 --> 00:30:12,652
President Lee Gangmo
can be trusted to deliver.

350
00:30:15,227 --> 00:30:16,845
Chairman...

351
00:30:26,186 --> 00:30:28,372
She's been looking after Seongmo.

352
00:30:32,026 --> 00:30:33,892
Thank you.

353
00:31:09,141 --> 00:31:11,318
Seongmo Oppa.

354
00:31:16,569 --> 00:31:21,326
It's... Miju, Oppa.

355
00:31:24,968 --> 00:31:26,838
It's me...

356
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:29,328
Don't you recognize me?

357
00:31:31,712 --> 00:31:34,684
I said I'm Miju, Big Oppa...

358
00:31:58,966 --> 00:32:01,316
Seongmo Oppa...

359
00:32:03,166 --> 00:32:07,021
Oppa... What happened to you?

360
00:32:07,815 --> 00:32:10,928
What have they done to you?

361
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:13,806
Oppa...

362
00:32:14,088 --> 00:32:16,237
Big Oppa...

363
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:36,768
What is this?

364
00:32:37,551 --> 00:32:39,654
Open it.

365
00:32:47,847 --> 00:32:51,347
It's everything I have left.

366
00:32:51,804 --> 00:32:53,978
Acquire Manbo Construction with it.

367
00:32:54,342 --> 00:32:55,458
Mom...

368
00:32:55,576 --> 00:33:00,078
I closed up shop with this.

369
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:04,342
You take care of it now, Jeongyeon.

370
00:33:05,446 --> 00:33:11,061
But you worked your entire life for this...

371
00:33:11,525 --> 00:33:13,055
I can't accept it.

372
00:33:13,163 --> 00:33:18,402
I did it all to give it to my daughter.

373
00:33:18,883 --> 00:33:21,761
It was yours from the very start.

374
00:33:23,317 --> 00:33:26,596
We manage to gain control
of Manbo Construction again...

375
00:33:26,795 --> 00:33:29,086
It feels like a dream.

376
00:33:29,614 --> 00:33:35,534
Right... Gangmo will do great.

377
00:33:37,128 --> 00:33:38,827
Dad...

378
00:33:39,109 --> 00:33:42,680
We're going to move down to Jeju.

379
00:33:42,821 --> 00:33:46,744
We have some farmland there.

380
00:33:48,295 --> 00:33:52,450
I only have one thing left to ask you.

381
00:33:52,979 --> 00:33:56,808
To meet a good man and get married.

382
00:33:57,829 --> 00:33:59,768
Mom...

383
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:30,060
Congressman.

384
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:30,918
Minwoo is here.

385
00:34:31,012 --> 00:34:36,685
Things must be hard at work, but
I see you still found the time to visit me.

386
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,092
You look much better than I thought.

387
00:34:41,114 --> 00:34:42,617
You pathetic fool.

388
00:34:42,815 --> 00:34:45,371
How the hell did you build
that place, to make it collapse?

389
00:34:45,453 --> 00:34:47,638
Do you even know
who's responsible for that?

390
00:34:48,296 --> 00:34:49,929
That was all...

391
00:34:50,669 --> 00:34:53,617
Get the company back on
its feet before I come back.

392
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:55,673
It's all over now.

393
00:34:56,545 --> 00:34:58,516
You still don't get it?

394
00:34:58,852 --> 00:35:01,476
It's over for the both of us.

395
00:35:03,696 --> 00:35:07,478
This is Congressman Oh's villa.

396
00:35:07,713 --> 00:35:10,904
As long as I stay
here, nobody will find me.

397
00:35:11,009 --> 00:35:14,087
- Dad...
- And it's not just Congressman Oh.

398
00:35:14,204 --> 00:35:16,841
Congressmen Park, Choi and Hong...

399
00:35:17,047 --> 00:35:20,559
They're all in my pocket,
and the list goes on.

400
00:35:20,876 --> 00:35:22,250
Is that clear?

401
00:35:22,673 --> 00:35:25,277
I'm still alive and well.

402
00:35:25,577 --> 00:35:28,307
Just worry about your end of the bargain.

403
00:35:30,802 --> 00:35:32,524
The company...

404
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:38,630
is about to be acquired by Hangang Construction.

405
00:35:44,057 --> 00:35:45,161
What...

406
00:35:45,278 --> 00:35:50,741
Lee Gangmo is going to
get his hands on Manbo Group.

407
00:35:51,743 --> 00:35:54,374
What kind of retarded
nonsense are you yapping about?

408
00:35:54,515 --> 00:35:56,112
Turn yourself in.

409
00:35:56,852 --> 00:35:59,464
- Minwoo, you...
- Do it, and accept your punishment.

410
00:35:59,568 --> 00:36:01,692
You son of a...

411
00:36:03,189 --> 00:36:06,044
When are you going to put a
stop to all that ambition of yours?

412
00:36:06,138 --> 00:36:08,264
The day I do that,
it'll only mean my death!

413
00:36:08,358 --> 00:36:09,497
And I won't die!

414
00:36:09,568 --> 00:36:12,645
Please... Stop it, Dad!

415
00:36:17,435 --> 00:36:19,172
Minwoo.

416
00:36:20,441 --> 00:36:25,703
If you let Lee Gangmo take
the company from you, we'll lose.

417
00:36:25,961 --> 00:36:28,711
Our life will become a failure.

418
00:36:30,861 --> 00:36:33,351
Don't you give up.

419
00:36:34,357 --> 00:36:38,426
Life can always be turned around.

420
00:36:38,684 --> 00:36:41,139
And if you're Jo Pilyeon's son,

421
00:36:41,321 --> 00:36:46,196
you must endure it to the very
end and emerge victorious, Minwoo.

422
00:36:50,648 --> 00:36:53,208
You once told me that you wish...

423
00:36:55,534 --> 00:36:58,667
I could be the only
man who beats you, right?

424
00:37:02,449 --> 00:37:08,977
I will help put an end
to that ambition of yours.

425
00:37:10,992 --> 00:37:12,836
Minwoo, you...

426
00:37:14,219 --> 00:37:16,899
What are you thinking?

427
00:37:17,027 --> 00:37:19,937
It is the very last thing....

428
00:37:23,484 --> 00:37:26,527
I could do for my father's sake.

429
00:37:38,933 --> 00:37:40,613
Minwoo?

430
00:37:41,799 --> 00:37:43,902
Mi... Minwoo!

431
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:47,686
G... Get him...
Go get him! Now!

432
00:37:47,792 --> 00:37:51,554
Have you heard me?

433
00:37:51,687 --> 00:37:52,595
Now.

434
00:37:52,689 --> 00:37:55,495
Now... Go get him now!!

435
00:37:57,166 --> 00:37:59,656
I'm sorry, Congressman.

436
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:38,519
- Hangang & Manbo
Construction Merger Signing -

437
00:38:47,637 --> 00:38:55,211
And that officially concludes the merger
between Hangang and Manbo Construction.

438
00:39:20,473 --> 00:39:22,282
My father...

439
00:39:24,643 --> 00:39:26,558
is staying there.

440
00:39:30,634 --> 00:39:37,253
Even if he pays for what he did,
I still hope at least you will forgive him.

441
00:40:09,072 --> 00:40:10,705
Jaechun.

442
00:40:14,209 --> 00:40:17,545
You regret meeting me, too?

443
00:40:18,603 --> 00:40:20,434
Thanks to you,

444
00:40:21,473 --> 00:40:25,987
I've had the time of my life.

445
00:40:26,128 --> 00:40:27,279
Really?

446
00:40:28,642 --> 00:40:30,251
Thanks.

447
00:40:32,753 --> 00:40:40,897
I at least wanted to show you
what a winner really looked like...

448
00:40:54,984 --> 00:40:56,769
I apologize.

449
00:40:58,437 --> 00:41:01,997
For not serving you like I should have.

450
00:41:05,514 --> 00:41:11,599
Do I look that miserable and pathetic to you?

451
00:41:11,951 --> 00:41:17,683
You always looked like
a man of great majesty to my eyes.

452
00:41:17,835 --> 00:41:19,543
Majesty?!

453
00:41:23,267 --> 00:41:25,487
Majesty...

454
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:38,264
Jaechun.

455
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:41,941
I will take this,

456
00:41:42,117 --> 00:41:45,403
and have one last go at it.

457
00:41:48,557 --> 00:41:54,952
I can never hear that
Lee Gangmo call me a loser.

458
00:41:57,078 --> 00:41:59,661
You just wait, Jaechun.

459
00:42:01,056 --> 00:42:05,382
Lee Gangmo is going to die.

460
00:42:09,575 --> 00:42:13,489
If that's what it takes
to win, I'll have to do it.

461
00:43:05,384 --> 00:43:06,254
Jaechun!

462
00:43:06,359 --> 00:43:07,393
Jaechun...

463
00:43:07,487 --> 00:43:10,189
Providence was on my side all along!

464
00:43:10,467 --> 00:43:14,993
Lee Gangmo came here on his own!

465
00:43:18,113 --> 00:43:19,584
I can't wait.

466
00:43:19,725 --> 00:43:21,252
Come, Lee Gangmo!

467
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:22,215
Go ahead.

468
00:43:22,309 --> 00:43:23,942
Go ahead and come, Lee Gangmo.

469
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:27,585
I... I will kill you once and for all.

470
00:43:27,689 --> 00:43:31,487
I'll finish you just like
I did with your father.

471
00:43:34,094 --> 00:43:35,011
That gun...

472
00:43:35,081 --> 00:43:37,700
Now... Give it to me... Do it.

473
00:43:37,783 --> 00:43:40,578
Come on... The gun.

474
00:44:18,252 --> 00:44:20,003
Jaechun.

475
00:44:21,929 --> 00:44:23,327
What...

476
00:44:23,949 --> 00:44:26,815
What did you just do?

477
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:31,044
Jaechun?

478
00:44:31,713 --> 00:44:33,358
Get up.

479
00:44:33,667 --> 00:44:35,877
He's coming in.

480
00:44:36,851 --> 00:44:39,166
We have no time to waste here.

481
00:44:40,201 --> 00:44:42,526
Get up, Jaechun.

482
00:44:52,512 --> 00:44:54,450
Jaechun!

483
00:44:55,757 --> 00:44:57,539
Jaechun!

484
00:45:21,701 --> 00:45:23,263
What's this?

485
00:45:25,307 --> 00:45:28,331
You really think you beat me?

486
00:45:29,529 --> 00:45:31,514
From the very start,

487
00:45:32,882 --> 00:45:38,222
I had no intention of
beating you whatsoever.

488
00:45:39,690 --> 00:45:45,442
Because what I was
fighting against wasn't you.

489
00:45:47,968 --> 00:45:49,189
What?!

490
00:45:49,377 --> 00:45:51,327
Jo Pilyeon.

491
00:45:52,913 --> 00:45:58,972
And the kind of
world run by people like you.

492
00:46:00,605 --> 00:46:02,872
What I was fighting against...

493
00:46:03,154 --> 00:46:11,280
was that ruthless and dirty
world people like you created.

494
00:46:12,601 --> 00:46:14,546
From the very beginning,

495
00:46:15,615 --> 00:46:21,384
you were utterly insignificant to me.

496
00:46:26,905 --> 00:46:28,914
But now I might...

497
00:46:31,122 --> 00:46:42,693
Now I might finally start
to believe in this world again.

498
00:46:44,314 --> 00:46:46,387
Since it forced...

499
00:46:47,761 --> 00:46:53,681
such a miserable downfall on you.

500
00:47:38,151 --> 00:47:40,639
- And Minwoo...
- Right now,

501
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,871
he's on the rooftop.

502
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:47,099
By any chance,

503
00:47:47,593 --> 00:47:50,036
was he the one who rescued me?

504
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:54,312
Yes. The chairman did.

505
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:01,102
And the main investor in all
those films you starred in...

506
00:48:01,316 --> 00:48:03,592
was him.

507
00:48:05,483 --> 00:48:09,613
Despite knowing that Wooju wasn't his son...

508
00:48:09,693 --> 00:48:11,653
Wait a moment.

509
00:48:12,934 --> 00:48:17,750
Minwoo knows about Wooju?

510
00:48:18,666 --> 00:48:20,101
Yes.

511
00:48:20,831 --> 00:48:22,298
He does.

512
00:48:22,488 --> 00:48:27,713
But... Wooju is not Minwoo's son?!

513
00:49:06,409 --> 00:49:08,723
Don't, Minwoo!

514
00:49:13,095 --> 00:49:15,603
You can't die...

515
00:49:16,009 --> 00:49:18,504
Don't do it, Minwoo.

516
00:49:26,247 --> 00:49:28,244
I beg you...

517
00:49:29,461 --> 00:49:31,720
Please, come down.

518
00:49:31,944 --> 00:49:34,892
Come down.

519
00:49:37,629 --> 00:49:39,458
If...

520
00:49:42,853 --> 00:49:45,625
If I'll ever be born again,

521
00:49:46,479 --> 00:49:47,963
then...

522
00:49:51,645 --> 00:49:54,358
I'll be born as your brother.

523
00:49:57,367 --> 00:50:03,488
Since a family never breaks up.

524
00:50:07,928 --> 00:50:12,369
Since I could forever be by your side.

525
00:50:14,647 --> 00:50:16,233
Minwoo...

526
00:50:18,457 --> 00:50:20,548
I'm sorry, Miju.

527
00:50:24,612 --> 00:50:26,879
I'm tired.

528
00:50:29,992 --> 00:50:32,782
I can't take this anymore.

529
00:50:42,184 --> 00:50:43,997
Wooju!

530
00:50:45,759 --> 00:50:48,355
He's your son.

531
00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:06,276
What...

532
00:51:07,263 --> 00:51:09,693
did you just say?

533
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:15,543
Wooju is... what?

534
00:51:16,039 --> 00:51:18,809
He's your son.

535
00:51:23,907 --> 00:51:28,958
Your father knows about him.

536
00:51:42,991 --> 00:51:45,965
If you die like that,

537
00:51:47,997 --> 00:51:51,462
I'll never be able to look at
Wooju the same way again.

538
00:53:14,376 --> 00:53:17,260
Case file no. 1316.

539
00:53:17,358 --> 00:53:20,009
The defendant Jo Minwoo is sentenced
to two years in prison...

540
00:53:20,103 --> 00:53:24,811
for embezzlement of public funds and
injuries as a result of professional negligence.

541
00:53:29,032 --> 00:53:35,336
- Jo Pilyeon Trial Overturned Again -
Life Sentence Confirmed

542
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:16,115
What is this place?

543
00:54:21,189 --> 00:54:23,515
Why did you bring me here?

544
00:54:26,428 --> 00:54:28,280
That house.

545
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:35,410
You told me you'd like to
live in a place like this, right?

546
00:54:36,448 --> 00:54:44,361
With the big dog, the
terrace, and the white piano.

547
00:54:44,690 --> 00:54:52,137
With roses and
lilacs surrounding the place.

548
00:54:54,052 --> 00:54:58,962
Everything you
wanted is inside that place.

549
00:55:10,215 --> 00:55:11,813
How about it?

550
00:55:14,058 --> 00:55:16,030
You like it?

551
00:55:18,355 --> 00:55:21,423
- Hwang Jeongyeon -

552
00:55:27,719 --> 00:55:29,692
I love it.

553
00:55:32,617 --> 00:55:34,124
But...

554
00:55:34,570 --> 00:55:37,589
I think it might
be too big for me alone.

555
00:55:37,932 --> 00:55:43,944
Want to look at
what's in the mailbox?

556
00:56:18,253 --> 00:56:20,195
This notebook...

557
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:22,744
Back then,

558
00:56:24,390 --> 00:56:26,635
I took it out of the water.

559
00:56:29,188 --> 00:56:30,746
Then....

560
00:56:32,403 --> 00:56:36,984
you've been keeping it all this time?

561
00:56:37,371 --> 00:56:39,205
To me,

562
00:56:41,057 --> 00:56:44,057
it's the most
precious thing in the world.

563
00:56:53,230 --> 00:56:58,410
- Lee Gangmo -

564
00:57:06,272 --> 00:57:08,049
This house...

565
00:57:09,328 --> 00:57:13,241
is a little too big for
you to handle it all by yourself,

566
00:57:15,226 --> 00:57:16,565
so, like...

567
00:57:16,671 --> 00:57:19,254
If it's too hard for you to do it alone...

568
00:57:28,451 --> 00:57:29,931
Fine.

569
00:57:31,261 --> 00:57:33,821
I'll just be honest.

570
00:57:34,133 --> 00:57:38,883
I don't think I'd be able to
live the rest of my life alone.

571
00:57:45,126 --> 00:57:46,794
So will you...

572
00:57:49,002 --> 00:57:51,246
marry me?

573
00:58:06,923 --> 00:58:09,064
- Will You Marry Me? -

574
00:58:14,288 --> 00:58:16,198
I love you, Jeongyeon.

575
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:55,152
Oppa.

576
00:58:55,774 --> 00:58:58,464
You'll overcome that surgery, right?

577
00:59:00,837 --> 00:59:03,609
I'll be right back, Oppa.

578
00:59:03,854 --> 00:59:06,454
You said you miss Wooju.

579
00:59:06,595 --> 00:59:08,956
I'll go get him,

580
00:59:09,215 --> 00:59:12,809
so you must have
that surgery and get better.

581
00:59:12,891 --> 00:59:14,665
All right?

582
00:59:34,127 --> 00:59:37,555
It's time, let's go.

583
00:59:40,515 --> 00:59:43,390
I'll be back soon, Little Oppa.

584
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:58,967
Hyung.

585
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:05,175
Remember what we promised?

586
01:01:07,817 --> 01:01:09,368
To never,

587
01:01:11,976 --> 01:01:14,489
ever live apart again.

588
01:01:16,557 --> 01:01:18,112
You,

589
01:01:19,209 --> 01:01:22,329
Miju and I.

590
01:01:32,831 --> 01:01:34,654
You must overcome this.

591
01:01:35,041 --> 01:01:36,380
Seongmo....

592
01:01:36,662 --> 01:01:39,129
will be more than capable of it.

593
01:01:40,644 --> 01:01:44,482
Don't worry too much, Gangmo.

594
01:02:42,967 --> 01:02:44,772
It's time.

595
01:02:45,838 --> 01:02:47,459
Hyung...

596
01:03:17,302 --> 01:03:21,055
- Two Years Later -

597
01:03:40,659 --> 01:03:44,747
It's the ticket Wooju
bought with his savings.

598
01:03:58,955 --> 01:04:02,337
- Lee Seongmo -

599
01:04:15,098 --> 01:04:16,924
Big Oppa.

600
01:04:17,893 --> 01:04:22,045
You're doing fine up in
heaven with Mom and Dad, right?

601
01:04:22,796 --> 01:04:26,908
Wooju won a
scholarship at an art school.

602
01:04:27,850 --> 01:04:31,210
I miss you, Seongmo Oppa.

603
01:04:31,608 --> 01:04:33,653
I love you...

604
01:04:35,908 --> 01:04:39,103
- 2010 -

605
01:05:08,302 --> 01:05:09,665
Who is it?

606
01:05:09,798 --> 01:05:11,105
Excuse me.

607
01:05:11,217 --> 01:05:15,188
I'm looking for Mister Gangmo Lee.

608
01:05:15,423 --> 01:05:20,200
~ Chairman Lee Gangmo
wins at Global Business Awards ~

609
01:05:21,728 --> 01:05:26,648
If you have the guts,
go ahead and shoot me.

610
01:05:27,012 --> 01:05:29,420
Shouldn't you avenge your father?

611
01:05:29,549 --> 01:05:30,818
Come on.

612
01:05:31,100 --> 01:05:33,261
Do it!

613
01:06:09,797 --> 01:06:14,973
And you want me to stain my hands
with that dirty blood of yours?

614
01:06:15,830 --> 01:06:18,464
If you desire to die that much,

615
01:06:18,825 --> 01:06:21,271
go ahead and jump off.

616
01:06:21,482 --> 01:06:22,575
What?

617
01:06:22,775 --> 01:06:26,075
If the city you always dreamed of
becomes your burial ground,

618
01:06:26,968 --> 01:06:29,958
I'm sure you'll have nothing
to complain about.

619
01:06:37,311 --> 01:06:39,296
Keep this in mind.

620
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:42,743
All the wicked sins
you people have committed...

621
01:06:43,295 --> 01:06:47,982
will forever be remembered by that city.

622
01:06:48,088 --> 01:06:49,168
You bastard...

623
01:06:49,341 --> 01:06:51,623
Lee Gangmo, you bastard!

624
01:06:59,775 --> 01:07:03,192
You bastard!

625
01:07:23,113 --> 01:07:26,027
Former congressman Jo Pilyeon
committed suicide this evening at nine,

626
01:07:26,121 --> 01:07:30,373
jumping off a building in
Dogok-Dong, Gangnam District.

627
01:07:30,502 --> 01:07:33,157
With a past as winner of
the 12th congressional elections,

628
01:07:33,228 --> 01:07:35,226
Jo was sentenced to life in prison,

629
01:07:35,297 --> 01:07:38,785
and eventually moved to preventive
custody as a result of schizophrenia.

630
01:07:38,914 --> 01:07:43,190
{\a6}The 4th of this month, Jo had
escaped from the mental institution...

631
01:07:40,394 --> 01:07:43,299
Turn that off.

632
01:07:47,138 --> 01:07:50,381
Things have really changed.

633
01:07:50,697 --> 01:07:54,985
Once the highway from
Seoul to Sokcho is completed,

634
01:07:55,091 --> 01:07:59,038
they say you'll be able to come
back from work on the same day, Chairman.

635
01:08:27,715 --> 01:08:29,881
How far can you see?

636
01:08:36,435 --> 01:08:39,066
I can't see where it ends.

637
01:08:39,677 --> 01:08:44,239
All the land your eyes can see is ours!

638
01:08:45,731 --> 01:08:48,256
Ehh... Liar!

639
01:08:48,492 --> 01:08:50,304
He's right, Miju!

640
01:08:50,453 --> 01:08:53,002
That's our land!

641
01:08:55,858 --> 01:08:58,536
Big Oppa!!

642
01:09:00,122 --> 01:09:02,706
Little Oppa!!

643
01:09:03,294 --> 01:09:05,655
Hurry up and come!

644
01:09:05,932 --> 01:09:08,598
Quick!

645
01:09:10,278 --> 01:09:12,099
Gangmo...

646
01:09:13,426 --> 01:09:15,153
Hyung!

647
01:09:17,338 --> 01:09:19,326
Seongmo Oppa!!

648
01:09:19,455 --> 01:09:21,464
Gangmo Oppa!!

649
01:10:10,707 --> 01:10:12,869
Ohh... Honey.

650
01:10:13,485 --> 01:10:15,618
I'm headed home.

651
01:10:15,885 --> 01:10:17,509
Hurry up.

652
01:10:17,709 --> 01:10:22,337
