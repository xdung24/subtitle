4
00:00:08,711 --> 00:00:10,956
What are you trying to tell me?

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,312
Get rid of Lee Gangmo.

6
00:00:17,334 --> 00:00:18,981
<i>Kill him.</i>

7
00:00:19,193 --> 00:00:21,752
Do it quietly, without
attracting anyone's attention.

8
00:00:31,842 --> 00:00:36,595
With this money, start by
bribing the camp instructor.

9
00:00:37,128 --> 00:00:38,593
I'm sure you know already,

10
00:00:38,746 --> 00:00:42,719
but there are plenty of dead bodies
coming out of the Samcheong camp.

11
00:00:42,883 --> 00:00:47,233
- So getting rid of Lee Gangmo...
- Is a walk in the park.

12
00:00:47,409 --> 00:00:49,678
Leave it to me.

13
00:00:51,529 --> 00:00:56,491
I think leaving you at the ANSP 
was the right choice.

14
00:00:57,801 --> 00:01:01,534
So did you find an informer
willing to reveal Min Honggi's past?

15
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,615
We'll soon find a solution to that.

16
00:01:04,014 --> 00:01:08,329
You just worry about Lee Gangmo.

17
00:01:08,721 --> 00:01:12,632
I already have other plans
for our campaign issues.

18
00:01:21,535 --> 00:01:24,791
Shouldn't you at least tell me 
where you're taking me?

19
00:01:26,225 --> 00:01:27,937
Aren't you listening to me?

20
00:01:28,038 --> 00:01:30,482
What's wrong with you?

21
00:01:34,778 --> 00:01:37,553
If you don't stop the car,
I'll just step out right now!

22
00:01:37,623 --> 00:01:40,021
Keep quiet, will you?

23
00:01:50,933 --> 00:01:53,049
Careful about Jeongshik.

24
00:01:54,354 --> 00:01:56,705
I said be careful about him.

25
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:58,746
Didn't you say you're not the
kind of woman I think you are?!

26
00:01:58,898 --> 00:02:01,026
And neither am I a child.

27
00:02:01,144 --> 00:02:04,254
I can protect myself.

28
00:02:04,566 --> 00:02:06,539
You can?

29
00:02:10,477 --> 00:02:13,310
Wh...What are you doing?

30
00:02:13,475 --> 00:02:16,379
If Jeongshik starts acting
like this, what will you do?

31
00:02:29,777 --> 00:02:32,160
I could just do this, for instance?!

32
00:02:35,399 --> 00:02:37,297
Is your nose bleeding?

33
00:02:37,545 --> 00:02:39,397
Let me see.

34
00:02:41,524 --> 00:02:43,946
It's just fine.

35
00:02:46,814 --> 00:02:48,648
You laugh?!

36
00:02:49,705 --> 00:02:51,996
Is this funny?

37
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:55,463
Ehh... I ought to...

38
00:03:00,215 --> 00:03:04,828
Chief, you seem nicer than I thought.

39
00:03:05,049 --> 00:03:06,015
What?

40
00:03:06,215 --> 00:03:09,001
You'll also withdraw the lawsuit, right?

41
00:03:09,154 --> 00:03:10,200
Hey...

42
00:03:10,553 --> 00:03:12,245
You...

43
00:03:26,469 --> 00:03:30,436
<i>- Ajumma, another serving here.
- Yes, just a moment.</i>

44
00:03:30,555 --> 00:03:33,241
<i>- More water here, please.
- Yes.</i>

45
00:03:33,323 --> 00:03:35,039
Hey...

46
00:03:38,591 --> 00:03:40,588
Told you we should have 
gone to a better place.

47
00:03:40,788 --> 00:03:43,115
It'll stink up all my clothes!

48
00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:45,358
So hurry up and turn the meat.

49
00:03:45,464 --> 00:03:47,239
Don't know how.

50
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:49,626
You can't even hold chopsticks?

51
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,365
I never tried 
cooking meat myself before.

52
00:03:52,694 --> 00:03:55,292
You sure have it easy...

53
00:03:55,409 --> 00:03:56,794
So go ahead and eat.

54
00:03:56,947 --> 00:03:58,699
I don't like overcooked meat.

55
00:03:59,341 --> 00:04:00,403
Let's just forget it.

56
00:04:00,497 --> 00:04:03,001
I'll just have it all for myself.

57
00:04:12,474 --> 00:04:15,052
Don't show up before me again.

58
00:04:17,427 --> 00:04:20,883
So you're going 
to withdraw the lawsuit?

59
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:24,449
Stop wasting your time and
just give it up, that's all.

60
00:04:26,659 --> 00:04:28,857
I'm not giving up.

61
00:04:29,367 --> 00:04:33,088
I'll toughen it up with meat and keep 
pestering you until you withdraw it,

62
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:35,262
so consider yourself warned.

63
00:04:58,072 --> 00:05:02,460
No... This makes no sense.

64
00:05:02,601 --> 00:05:04,444
Why would I...

65
00:05:05,237 --> 00:05:11,026
Hey. Why did they take me here
and force all this on me?

66
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:13,820
See? Something's wrong here...
Either a document mishap or...

67
00:05:13,857 --> 00:05:15,465
Still don't get it?

68
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:17,578
What... Get what?

69
00:05:17,672 --> 00:05:22,722
We were sent here by
Jo Minwoo and Hwang Jeongshik.

70
00:05:23,485 --> 00:05:26,495
They could have just sent you, 
why involve me...

71
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,739
Because you didn't get rid of me.

72
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:29,990
What?

73
00:05:30,075 --> 00:05:35,200
Thought they'd treat a powerless and 
ignorant fool like you with respect?

74
00:05:37,633 --> 00:05:41,460
You lousy ass sons of a
motherless bitch with rabies...

75
00:05:44,907 --> 00:05:46,567
Enough!

76
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,578
TV reporters are waiting outside.

77
00:05:55,808 --> 00:05:57,289
Other than anything
dealing with your re-education,

78
00:05:57,402 --> 00:05:59,483
all unnecessary remarks
are strictly prohibited.

79
00:05:59,605 --> 00:06:01,806
- Is that clear?
- Yes, Sir!

80
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:04,551
Any volunteers for
the self-criticism speech?

81
00:06:08,427 --> 00:06:10,051
Whoever comes forward,

82
00:06:10,321 --> 00:06:13,784
make a good showing and we'll 
promote you to Chief Inmate.

83
00:06:14,668 --> 00:06:16,783
I volunteer!

84
00:06:19,615 --> 00:06:21,092
Good.

85
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:23,781
Everyone report to the parade ground.

86
00:06:25,765 --> 00:06:29,057
If I wasn't blessed by the
purifying Samcheong re-education,

87
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:33,585
I would have spent the rest
of my days living like a beast!

88
00:06:33,783 --> 00:06:38,429
It was thanks to the precious
re-education I was given here...

89
00:06:38,645 --> 00:06:42,445
that I was able to be
reborn as a decent person!

90
00:06:42,892 --> 00:06:50,082
<i>For giving such a golden opportunity
to a miserable fool like me,</i>

91
00:06:50,185 --> 00:06:54,677
I can only extend President 
Jeon Duhwan my sincerest gratitude,

92
00:06:54,827 --> 00:07:02,435
and promise I will spend the rest of 
my days sacrificing for the sake...

93
00:07:02,652 --> 00:07:06,113
of our beloved nation!

94
00:07:20,053 --> 00:07:22,159
We're from Daehan Television.

95
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:27,131
<i>Share with us your thoughts on the
re-education process you've experienced.</i>

96
00:07:33,135 --> 00:07:37,592
Don't be nervous,
and just speak your mind.

97
00:07:37,696 --> 00:07:39,182
Let's start from scratch.

98
00:07:39,868 --> 00:07:42,633
Share your thoughts with our viewers.

99
00:07:44,889 --> 00:07:49,528
This is not a re-education camp,

100
00:07:50,045 --> 00:07:52,593
but a human slaughterhouse,
where undiscriminating violence...

101
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:55,569
is perpetrated on a daily basis.

102
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:59,688
<i>Think everyone taken here
was a gangster or a thief?</i>

103
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:04,710
Just to fill their quota, every police
station forced innocent people here!

104
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:09,055
You'll get us into trouble this way...

105
00:08:09,953 --> 00:08:11,655
Take a good look, fellow citizens!

106
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:14,805
Just yesterday, 
one of us was beaten to death!

107
00:08:14,909 --> 00:08:17,551
Your fathers, sons and brothers
are being taken here for no reason,

108
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:18,934
<i>and killed indiscriminately!</i>

109
00:08:18,981 --> 00:08:21,271
Hey... Stop him!

110
00:08:22,042 --> 00:08:25,540
You are being deceived!
This place is pure hell!

111
00:08:25,616 --> 00:08:30,644
There is no re-education, just cruel 
assaults against innocent people!

112
00:08:37,801 --> 00:08:39,616
Seonsaengnim!

113
00:08:43,002 --> 00:08:44,870
Seonsaengnim!

114
00:08:46,237 --> 00:08:47,751
You people!

115
00:08:47,845 --> 00:08:49,416
Give us back that camera!

116
00:08:49,491 --> 00:08:50,723
This interview is over.

117
00:08:50,808 --> 00:08:52,840
Still, give us back that camera.

118
00:08:52,906 --> 00:08:56,037
For reasons of military security,
today's interview cannot be broadcast.

119
00:08:56,188 --> 00:08:58,652
Take away those fools.

120
00:09:26,512 --> 00:09:27,898
- Hey...
- Yes.

121
00:09:27,983 --> 00:09:29,478
Can't you read what's written here?

122
00:09:29,534 --> 00:09:33,042
- Yes, Sir...
- I'm the Chief Inmate here.

123
00:09:40,702 --> 00:09:42,395
Everyone stop!

124
00:09:42,546 --> 00:09:43,223
Red hunt!

125
00:09:43,288 --> 00:09:46,365
- Everyone stand.
- Everyone stand!

126
00:09:52,744 --> 00:09:56,382
<i>The collective will be held
responsible for today's actions.</i>

127
00:09:56,523 --> 00:10:01,442
Therefore, you will spend all
day and night in this position.

128
00:10:04,366 --> 00:10:07,193
Should anyone fall down before 
tomorrow morning's bugle call,

129
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:11,030
you will all miss breakfast.

130
00:10:11,274 --> 00:10:11,963
Is that clear?

131
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,917
Yes, Sir!

132
00:10:20,273 --> 00:10:21,806
Red hunt!

133
00:11:02,087 --> 00:11:04,710
Yes! No. 534!

134
00:11:06,673 --> 00:11:08,589
You little bastards...

135
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,987
Let's do it right!

136
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:28,305
Hang in there, Seonsaengnim.

137
00:11:29,133 --> 00:11:31,664
This will not be the end of it.

138
00:11:33,535 --> 00:11:34,833
Maybe...

139
00:11:36,507 --> 00:11:38,651
dying will be much less painful.

140
00:11:38,905 --> 00:11:40,976
I can't die here.

141
00:11:41,825 --> 00:11:44,314
I will survive and get out of here.

142
00:11:45,321 --> 00:11:47,559
Don't you die either, Seonsaengnim.

143
00:11:48,631 --> 00:11:50,639
That'd be what a coward would do.

144
00:11:51,931 --> 00:11:56,921
<i>If only to tell the world what
you felt, saw and went through here,</i>

145
00:11:57,437 --> 00:12:03,250
only think about surviving
and getting out of here.

146
00:12:05,202 --> 00:12:11,832
That is what smart people 
like you should do.

147
00:12:17,667 --> 00:12:20,887
I told you, if you tell him his
friend Shideok is here, he'll come.

148
00:12:20,962 --> 00:12:23,821
Ahh... You really don't
want to listen, do you?

149
00:12:23,915 --> 00:12:25,514
Lee Gangmo is not here.

150
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:28,514
How can you visit
someone who's not here?!

151
00:12:29,144 --> 00:12:30,460
What are you trying to say?

152
00:12:30,567 --> 00:12:32,743
Gangmo is not here?!

153
00:12:33,783 --> 00:12:35,235
Did they transfer him to another prison?

154
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:37,530
He wasn't transferred...

155
00:12:38,544 --> 00:12:41,183
They took him to the Samcheong camp.

156
00:12:41,475 --> 00:12:43,752
The Samcheong camp?!

157
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:46,271
They took Gangmo there?!

158
00:12:46,384 --> 00:12:49,261
Anyhow, now you know, 
so don't come again looking for him.

159
00:12:49,365 --> 00:12:51,546
- Wait...
- Where is that?

160
00:12:51,848 --> 00:12:54,029
Where is this place 
they took Gangmo to?

161
00:12:54,203 --> 00:12:55,449
Ahh... Really...

162
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,574
Wait! Warden!

163
00:13:06,408 --> 00:13:08,524
About those mudflats in Gaepo,

164
00:13:08,618 --> 00:13:10,771
they're quite vast.

165
00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:18,475
I'm sure I told you that
Lee Gangmo owns that land?!

166
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:23,967
Turns out that it 
falls right into my area.

167
00:13:24,201 --> 00:13:30,701
If it's a business matter, I'd like you to 
refrain from talking about it in my presence.

168
00:13:31,575 --> 00:13:35,449
But I believe I 
have the right to do that?

169
00:13:35,558 --> 00:13:37,454
Don't I?

170
00:13:43,444 --> 00:13:45,295
If I get elected,

171
00:13:45,389 --> 00:13:51,829
I'll let you build anything
you want on that land.

172
00:13:52,104 --> 00:13:53,646
Think about it.

173
00:13:53,787 --> 00:13:58,357
If my political influence and your
business smarts are put together,

174
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:02,730
those mudflats can become
the cream of Gangnam's crop.

175
00:14:03,577 --> 00:14:08,715
First worry about winning the elections,

176
00:14:08,903 --> 00:14:14,085
and when Lee Gangmo is released,
then we can discuss the matter again.

177
00:14:21,929 --> 00:14:24,167
Dad, Gangmo was...

178
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:28,665
Long time no see, Jeongyeon.

179
00:14:35,116 --> 00:14:36,804
You're here.

180
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:43,806
So I hear these days you're
working particularly hard?!

181
00:14:45,386 --> 00:14:50,973
No matter how busy you are, 
I'm disappointed you never pay us a visit.

182
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:58,005
Dad.

183
00:14:58,112 --> 00:14:59,602
Why don't you go?

184
00:15:00,394 --> 00:15:02,386
I certainly understand you,

185
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:05,470
- but your future mother-in-law...
- I guess...

186
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,945
he hasn't told you yet?

187
00:15:08,151 --> 00:15:09,810
Told me what?

188
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:15,481
Are you hiding something from me?

189
00:15:16,581 --> 00:15:18,408
Just go back for now.

190
00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:19,637
I'll explain everything at home.

191
00:15:19,712 --> 00:15:20,925
No.

192
00:15:22,016 --> 00:15:24,442
If you still don't know, 
I'll tell you.

193
00:15:24,565 --> 00:15:26,991
- Jeongyeon...
- They've...

194
00:15:28,063 --> 00:15:30,369
broken off the engagement.

195
00:15:34,156 --> 00:15:40,504
I did try everything I could to stop it,

196
00:15:41,252 --> 00:15:43,899
but seems like they 
weren't made for each other.

197
00:15:46,917 --> 00:15:48,667
Who is behind this?

198
00:15:49,937 --> 00:15:51,842
I asked him to do it.

199
00:15:52,077 --> 00:15:55,322
Because I thought I wouldn't be
able to endure a loveless marriage.

200
00:15:55,529 --> 00:15:56,779
So?

201
00:15:59,187 --> 00:16:02,983
You gave your consent?

202
00:16:03,906 --> 00:16:05,009
Yes.

203
00:16:06,056 --> 00:16:07,877
With pleasure.

204
00:16:29,131 --> 00:16:30,128
Dad.

205
00:16:30,241 --> 00:16:32,476
Have you heard about Gangmo?

206
00:16:32,618 --> 00:16:34,367
Heard what?

207
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,470
He was taken to the
Samcheong Re-education Camp.

208
00:16:37,762 --> 00:16:38,967
Say what?

209
00:16:39,092 --> 00:16:41,411
To the Samcheong camp?

210
00:16:42,232 --> 00:16:46,211
Find out what's going on.

211
00:16:46,531 --> 00:16:47,848
All right.

212
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:59,492
The Samcheong camp?!

213
00:17:16,913 --> 00:17:20,924
He didn't lock it?

214
00:17:22,355 --> 00:17:24,214
All the better.

215
00:17:32,594 --> 00:17:35,180
<i>Ohh... So messy.</i>

216
00:17:43,221 --> 00:17:44,481
<i>Dad...</i>

217
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:47,190
<i>Let me explain.</i>

218
00:17:50,434 --> 00:17:52,228
<i>Explain what?</i>

219
00:17:52,435 --> 00:17:55,266
<i>How you deceived me and
kept pushing it under the rug?</i>

220
00:17:55,962 --> 00:17:57,728
- Dad...
- Or is it...

221
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:01,876
the pathetic excuses of a 
foolish son who got miserably dumped?

222
00:18:01,979 --> 00:18:03,803
I just needed some time.

223
00:18:04,395 --> 00:18:08,195
I tried my best to make Jeongyeon
change her mind before the elections...

224
00:18:14,621 --> 00:18:18,790
Think I only did this 
to gain a daughter-in-law?

225
00:18:18,903 --> 00:18:21,301
<i>Have you forgotten 
what your purpose was?</i>

226
00:18:21,996 --> 00:18:26,101
First, completely erase 
that Jeongyeon from your mind.

227
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:30,480
Rid your mind of that cheap
sentimentalist claptrap you call love!

228
00:18:31,195 --> 00:18:33,678
And when you're done with that, 
find another way.

229
00:18:33,762 --> 00:18:37,778
A way not to rely on anyone else and
still gain control of Manbo Construction.

230
00:18:37,891 --> 00:18:39,702
Is that clear?

231
00:20:03,732 --> 00:20:05,547
I'm sorry...

232
00:20:05,792 --> 00:20:09,177
I was cleaning in the back, and...

233
00:20:25,813 --> 00:20:28,073
Aren't you hungry?

234
00:20:28,872 --> 00:20:31,251
Want to taste these out?

235
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:38,094
How will you drive later if you drink?

236
00:20:42,731 --> 00:20:46,392
There aren't that many cars anyway...

237
00:20:53,987 --> 00:20:55,887
Just try one.

238
00:20:56,047 --> 00:21:00,297
When I feel down, eating 
something usually does the trick.

239
00:21:03,824 --> 00:21:06,655
I wasn't looking on purpose...

240
00:21:07,962 --> 00:21:12,250
But was that your father, earlier on?

241
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:16,791
Shut your mouth.

242
00:21:18,983 --> 00:21:21,475
You should consider yourself lucky.

243
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:27,597
Even if I got scolded all day,
I wish I still had a father.

244
00:21:30,644 --> 00:21:34,650
My father passed away 
when I was little.

245
00:21:36,221 --> 00:21:38,832
I'm not in the mood, so stop it.

246
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:43,741
You don't even want kimbap...

247
00:21:44,023 --> 00:21:47,065
How can I cheer you up now?

248
00:21:50,493 --> 00:21:55,570
Either leave, 
or just keep your mouth shut.

249
00:22:03,256 --> 00:22:05,762
Did you just laugh at me?

250
00:22:08,367 --> 00:22:09,420
One minute.

251
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:12,843
No... Just stay put
for thirty seconds.

252
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:15,689
It'll make you feel better.

253
00:22:17,767 --> 00:22:19,723
When you're feeling down
and someone holds your hands,

254
00:22:19,789 --> 00:22:21,971
it'll give you strength.

255
00:22:25,964 --> 00:22:27,088
How is it?

256
00:22:27,218 --> 00:22:30,627
Doesn't it feel better and better?

257
00:22:35,012 --> 00:22:37,210
See? You're laughing.

258
00:22:37,327 --> 00:22:40,131
This is a wonder drug.

259
00:22:44,002 --> 00:22:46,702
Hey, what the hell are you...

260
00:22:46,914 --> 00:22:49,206
Now that you're all cheered up,
have something tasty.

261
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:52,298
Then you'll kiss the blues goodbye.

262
00:22:54,932 --> 00:22:57,224
What are you doing?
You need to chew now.

263
00:22:57,365 --> 00:23:00,057
Are you just 
swallowing it like that?

264
00:23:07,717 --> 00:23:10,128
With those dirty hands...

265
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:13,407
My hands are clean!

266
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:28,456
Forget it, then!

267
00:23:28,606 --> 00:23:31,145
See what happens if you ask again...

268
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:05,622
Did you sober up?

269
00:25:11,188 --> 00:25:15,640
You can just take me to the bus stop.

270
00:25:30,646 --> 00:25:32,247
Oh?!

271
00:25:32,435 --> 00:25:35,480
A few are missing?!

272
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:39,018
<i>Was it a rat?</i>

273
00:25:41,125 --> 00:25:43,801
I'm sure you didn't eat them...

274
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:48,280
Do you know where
they could have gone?

275
00:25:48,861 --> 00:25:51,395
I ate them, why?!

276
00:25:51,571 --> 00:25:53,241
Where are you spitting all that?

277
00:25:53,326 --> 00:25:56,359
<i>Ehh... He always acts so clean...</i>

278
00:25:56,711 --> 00:25:59,133
Look at this...

279
00:25:59,486 --> 00:26:03,330
As if they tasted any good...

280
00:26:12,478 --> 00:26:15,422
Director Ju tried
looking for him all over,

281
00:26:15,575 --> 00:26:18,725
but there's no way to know
where they've taken him.

282
00:26:20,477 --> 00:26:25,471
We're still looking for him,
so we'll soon find out.

283
00:26:26,041 --> 00:26:28,057
This doesn't sound right.

284
00:26:28,827 --> 00:26:30,114
What doesn't?

285
00:26:30,444 --> 00:26:33,147
I tried looking for what
this Samcheong camp really is.

286
00:26:33,371 --> 00:26:37,462
It's unlikely for prison inmates
to be transferred there.

287
00:26:37,733 --> 00:26:43,834
Then, are you telling me 
someone forced Gangmo there?

288
00:26:44,206 --> 00:26:46,055
That's the only explanation.

289
00:26:48,372 --> 00:26:50,177
Could it be...

290
00:26:50,743 --> 00:26:52,575
What, Dad?

291
00:26:54,772 --> 00:26:55,820
Never mind.

292
00:26:55,996 --> 00:26:59,090
You must be tired, so go to sleep.

293
00:27:12,593 --> 00:27:16,318
Get moving, you pricks!

294
00:27:40,306 --> 00:27:43,363
All right... All right...

295
00:27:56,186 --> 00:27:58,278
<i>No. 523.</i>

296
00:28:09,424 --> 00:28:10,317
You prick...

297
00:28:10,364 --> 00:28:12,892
It's always you...

298
00:28:14,972 --> 00:28:18,137
All right! I'm going...

299
00:28:18,723 --> 00:28:22,485
We'll all be punished again 
because of that idiot.

300
00:28:58,301 --> 00:29:00,069
Hyung...

301
00:29:03,013 --> 00:29:04,790
Gangmo.

302
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:30,553
We have all the time.

303
00:29:30,911 --> 00:29:32,989
Eat slowly.

304
00:29:34,801 --> 00:29:37,014
Have some yourself.

305
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:47,384
Jo Pilyeon ordered me to kill you.

306
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,911
Gangmo.

307
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:55,237
Let's just give them that land.

308
00:29:56,356 --> 00:29:58,528
I'm never going to give that up.

309
00:29:58,707 --> 00:30:00,287
Gangmo...

310
00:30:00,936 --> 00:30:03,291
You have the land deed, right?

311
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:09,301
Register it back to me,
under some kind of namesake.

312
00:30:09,376 --> 00:30:12,192
As long as you keep that land,

313
00:30:12,333 --> 00:30:14,383
they won't give up.

314
00:30:15,164 --> 00:30:17,769
They'll try to kill you, 
whatever it takes.

315
00:30:19,011 --> 00:30:21,822
Just report my death 
and get it over with.

316
00:30:22,179 --> 00:30:23,504
What?

317
00:30:24,827 --> 00:30:29,250
File Lee Gangmo as deceased.

318
00:30:30,999 --> 00:30:33,586
People call this hell.

319
00:30:34,303 --> 00:30:38,908
But to me, the real hell was everything
I had to go through all these years.

320
00:30:40,451 --> 00:30:44,489
This whole farce?! It's nothing.

321
00:30:47,366 --> 00:30:49,360
You just wait, Hyung.

322
00:30:51,561 --> 00:30:54,398
How I survive this place,

323
00:30:55,057 --> 00:30:57,633
how I get revenge on those people...

324
00:30:57,774 --> 00:30:59,608
Just wait and see.

325
00:31:00,801 --> 00:31:06,425
As that's when the real hell 
will begin for them.

326
00:31:19,075 --> 00:31:20,890
<i>You useless twat...</i>

327
00:31:22,329 --> 00:31:24,614
What do we have to go through 
because of you prick...

328
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:27,742
I'm sorry...

329
00:31:27,863 --> 00:31:31,672
Please... Spare me...

330
00:31:36,775 --> 00:31:38,599
Everyone, listen well.

331
00:31:38,985 --> 00:31:42,540
I'm the Chief Inmate here.

332
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:44,571
Can you read?

333
00:31:44,712 --> 00:31:47,044
Should anyone get on my nerves,

334
00:31:47,194 --> 00:31:48,539
consider yourselves dead.

335
00:31:48,614 --> 00:31:50,194
Is that clear?

336
00:31:58,413 --> 00:32:00,858
Same goes for you, you prick.

337
00:32:01,215 --> 00:32:03,651
No. 523.

338
00:32:22,983 --> 00:32:25,213
This is going too far.

339
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,743
Everyone is just worried
about his own survival.

340
00:32:27,884 --> 00:32:31,284
There's no need for 
cheap compassion here.

341
00:32:32,253 --> 00:32:35,752
Lag behind, and you're dead.

342
00:32:36,607 --> 00:32:40,959
Resilience is all you need here.

343
00:32:55,758 --> 00:32:57,771
This is just a deposit.

344
00:32:58,072 --> 00:33:01,268
Let's say you'll get
the rest after completion.

345
00:33:03,351 --> 00:33:07,626
Instead, you must keep 
this secret no matter what.

346
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:11,166
You said ANSP, right?

347
00:33:11,806 --> 00:33:14,166
What on earth are you scheming here,

348
00:33:14,523 --> 00:33:17,382
buying someone's death like this...

349
00:33:18,915 --> 00:33:21,395
I could tell you,
but then you'd have to die.

350
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:23,662
Still interested?

351
00:33:25,543 --> 00:33:26,887
No.

352
00:33:29,936 --> 00:33:32,263
<i>Let me repeat myself one last time.</i>

353
00:33:32,866 --> 00:33:36,345
If only a single whisper about all
this escapes these four walls,

354
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:39,937
all that this money will be
spent for is your funeral.

355
00:33:40,294 --> 00:33:42,851
I'll take it to my grave.

356
00:34:00,307 --> 00:34:01,735
Haven't you scared him off too much?

357
00:34:01,857 --> 00:34:06,268
The carrot alone doesn't work 
with people like him.

358
00:34:06,391 --> 00:34:08,836
So with the money Jo Pilyeon
gave you to kill your brother,

359
00:34:09,193 --> 00:34:11,234
you end up saving him.

360
00:34:11,497 --> 00:34:16,055
It won't be easy to bear for Gangmo.

361
00:34:17,625 --> 00:34:24,596
I must destroy Jo Pilyeon with my
own hands before Gangmo is released.

362
00:34:26,627 --> 00:34:32,157
That is the only thing 
I can do now for him.

363
00:34:40,603 --> 00:34:42,036
Open it.

364
00:34:42,177 --> 00:34:45,440
No... The encouragement you put
inside that case is more than enough.

365
00:34:45,534 --> 00:34:49,324
Elections aren't won
with encouragement alone.

366
00:34:51,854 --> 00:34:53,518
Aigoo!

367
00:34:54,007 --> 00:34:59,067
It's tight enough that even 
a coupon wouldn't fit inside.

368
00:35:01,541 --> 00:35:03,986
How's the situation proceeding?

369
00:35:04,117 --> 00:35:07,618
Yes... Jo Pilyeon is 
pressing on with his campaign,

370
00:35:07,711 --> 00:35:10,006
but Candidate Min is still ahead.

371
00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:15,536
So, what will you give us 
in return as interest?

372
00:35:16,758 --> 00:35:21,166
I can't say... If it was money,
I'm not too confident I could make it.

373
00:35:21,251 --> 00:35:26,301
If money was what I was going after,
I wouldn't have accepted this deal.

374
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:30,748
I will contribute to our area's
development through honest politics.

375
00:35:32,028 --> 00:35:36,239
Gyeongok, seems like
we spent our money in vain.

376
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:37,518
Yes, Sir.

377
00:35:37,725 --> 00:35:39,421
Ohh Ohh... This!

378
00:35:39,665 --> 00:35:42,336
Is that all you can tell him?

379
00:35:43,164 --> 00:35:46,381
I will serve you
for the rest of my days.

380
00:35:46,489 --> 00:35:49,437
What are you waiting for?
Take that briefcase!

381
00:35:50,566 --> 00:35:53,068
<i>I will pay you back 
through my triumph.</i>

382
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:58,390
I will defeat Jo Pilyeon at all cost,
and win the elections.

383
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:08,436
The most inept money lender is he who 
lends money he knows won't be paid back.

384
00:36:09,187 --> 00:36:11,448
<i>The same goes for elections.</i>

385
00:36:11,748 --> 00:36:16,959
There is nothing as foolish as 
entering a war you know you can't win.

386
00:36:18,577 --> 00:36:24,993
Don't let this money blind you 
into making careless decisions.

387
00:36:26,437 --> 00:36:31,854
Jo Pilyeon is not someone
you can take lightly.

388
00:36:31,985 --> 00:36:35,644
I will treasure and always keep 
in mind your words of advice.

389
00:36:47,049 --> 00:36:48,976
Here you are.

390
00:36:49,372 --> 00:36:51,177
I have bad news.

391
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,239
Does it concern Lee Gangmo?

392
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:54,508
No.

393
00:36:54,832 --> 00:37:00,324
Min Honggi has started receiving financial
support from lending kingpin Baekpa.

394
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:01,985
What?!

395
00:37:02,258 --> 00:37:03,614
Baekpa?!

396
00:37:03,746 --> 00:37:05,636
If Baekpa is getting involved,

397
00:37:05,796 --> 00:37:08,495
then these elections
become impossible to predict.

398
00:37:09,558 --> 00:37:11,053
That old fart...

399
00:37:11,307 --> 00:37:12,511
dares to deceive me?!

400
00:37:12,586 --> 00:37:14,061
What now?

401
00:37:14,155 --> 00:37:16,694
We can't compete with them when it
comes to mobilizing campaign funds.

402
00:37:16,778 --> 00:37:18,594
Call Chairman Hwang Taeseop.

403
00:37:18,669 --> 00:37:23,454
If they shovel money at us,
we'll answer with truckloads.

404
00:37:27,554 --> 00:37:28,749
Yes.

405
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:30,827
That's right.

406
00:37:31,274 --> 00:37:32,764
Go ahead.

407
00:37:34,363 --> 00:37:36,410
Is that true?

408
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:40,429
<i>Yes.</i>

409
00:37:41,407 --> 00:37:42,714
Understood.

410
00:37:43,466 --> 00:37:46,721
No... We will come firsthand.

411
00:37:47,749 --> 00:37:49,253
What's the matter?

412
00:37:49,677 --> 00:37:54,455
We've found an informer claiming
Min Honggi's father was a collaborator.

413
00:37:55,537 --> 00:37:57,117
Where is he?

414
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:58,781
<i>I jotted down his address.</i>

415
00:37:58,922 --> 00:38:00,784
Let's go there right now.

416
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:05,913
Are you in?

417
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:13,006
Is anyone home?

418
00:38:27,669 --> 00:38:34,664
Min Honggi and I used to 
live in the same neighborhood.

419
00:38:36,282 --> 00:38:41,764
From what we know, Candidate
Min's father ran a pharmacy?

420
00:38:41,887 --> 00:38:44,125
And he's renowned for
his many good deeds.

421
00:38:44,294 --> 00:38:48,108
Aigoo... That's just a
bunch of shameless lies.

422
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:53,831
He was a notoriously
ruthless colonial officer.

423
00:38:54,273 --> 00:38:57,210
Will you give us some more details?

424
00:38:57,295 --> 00:38:58,912
So what I was saying is,

425
00:38:59,251 --> 00:39:03,070
because my father helped
the independence movement,

426
00:39:03,211 --> 00:39:06,217
he died at the hands
of Min Honggi's father.

427
00:39:06,339 --> 00:39:09,565
<i>No matter how rotten
this world has become.</i>

428
00:39:09,668 --> 00:39:12,565
Does the descendant of an independence
activist living in this state...

429
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:17,001
while sons of pro-Japanese collaborators
run for Congress make any sense?

430
00:39:17,558 --> 00:39:20,377
I understand the feeling.

431
00:39:21,383 --> 00:39:25,333
But there were plenty of
opposition candidates to contact,

432
00:39:25,549 --> 00:39:28,805
why did you choose
to inform me instead?

433
00:39:30,761 --> 00:39:33,300
Ahh... That's because...

434
00:39:33,385 --> 00:39:37,186
That's because I liked
your campaign program!

435
00:39:37,346 --> 00:39:38,625
My program?!

436
00:39:38,748 --> 00:39:40,798
Politics for the working class!

437
00:39:40,911 --> 00:39:46,111
Uh? So I thought you'd give people
like me a chance to redeem themselves.

438
00:39:46,229 --> 00:39:48,723
There soon will be a
joint stumping session.

439
00:39:48,789 --> 00:39:52,564
Would you be prepared to help me out?

440
00:39:53,388 --> 00:39:57,151
Then, should I just 
hand you all the evidence?

441
00:39:57,254 --> 00:39:59,066
No, more than that...

442
00:39:59,217 --> 00:40:04,399
Why don't you bring that evidence
and speak on the stage?

443
00:40:04,493 --> 00:40:07,257
Who... Me?!

444
00:40:07,389 --> 00:40:09,196
I know it's a burdensome favor.

445
00:40:09,318 --> 00:40:15,609
But that's the most effective way 
to derail Min Honggi's candidacy.

446
00:40:16,488 --> 00:40:16,969
Yes...

447
00:40:17,029 --> 00:40:20,518
Let's do it.

448
00:40:21,009 --> 00:40:26,538
If that helps shed light
on my situation, I'm all for it.

449
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:34,238
We finally found what can
give Min Honggi a fatal blow.

450
00:40:34,633 --> 00:40:37,793
Seems like Lady Luck is on
your side for these elections.

451
00:40:37,906 --> 00:40:41,865
Even if Baekpa is helping him out,
could it compare with providence?

452
00:40:42,034 --> 00:40:45,122
Jaechun, you dig into him.

453
00:40:45,644 --> 00:40:50,971
Investigate his past, whether they 
really live in the same neighborhood,

454
00:40:51,065 --> 00:40:52,589
and how and when his father died.

455
00:40:52,702 --> 00:40:54,445
All right.

456
00:40:55,225 --> 00:40:57,572
<i>How did it go with Lee Gangmo?</i>

457
00:40:58,876 --> 00:41:01,651
I put everything in place.

458
00:41:01,968 --> 00:41:06,600
So all we need to wait
for is his death notice?

459
00:41:07,117 --> 00:41:10,151
I don't think you'll have
to wait that long for it.

460
00:41:11,509 --> 00:41:14,107
Jo Pilyeon's time in the
limelight is about to come.

461
00:41:14,213 --> 00:41:19,080
Seongmo, Jaechun...
Your struggles will soon be over.

462
00:41:30,601 --> 00:41:32,150
How did it go?

463
00:41:32,315 --> 00:41:33,768
It's done.

464
00:41:33,889 --> 00:41:37,684
Jo Pilyeon completely fell for our bait.

465
00:41:37,867 --> 00:41:39,013
That's great.

466
00:41:39,083 --> 00:41:41,631
You changed all of 
Mister Gong's records, right?

467
00:41:41,752 --> 00:41:42,998
Yes.

468
00:41:44,141 --> 00:41:46,195
Good job, Chanseong.

469
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:48,677
You just wait.

470
00:41:49,065 --> 00:41:53,956
This stumping session will
be Jo Pilyeon's very last.

471
00:42:02,093 --> 00:42:04,697
<i>There's no one going by that name here.</i>

472
00:42:31,059 --> 00:42:32,081
<i>Turn to the left!</i>

473
00:42:32,175 --> 00:42:34,315
Turn to the left!

474
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,755
<i>To the right!</i>

475
00:42:38,896 --> 00:42:41,035
To the right...

476
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:47,571
We had another one from
your company break from ranks.

477
00:42:49,394 --> 00:42:53,593
You'll move like snakes 
all the way to your barracks.

478
00:42:53,701 --> 00:42:54,372
Proceed!

479
00:42:54,443 --> 00:42:56,453
Proceed!

480
00:43:01,061 --> 00:43:04,952
<i>Get moving! Do it!</i>

481
00:43:07,416 --> 00:43:10,739
What are you waiting for?

482
00:43:29,233 --> 00:43:31,093
All right...

483
00:43:48,335 --> 00:43:50,804
Hey... Get up!

484
00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:52,932
<i>Wake up, you bastard!</i>

485
00:43:53,144 --> 00:43:55,135
<i>Hey!</i>

486
00:44:04,026 --> 00:44:07,649
All down on your head, you pricks!

487
00:44:23,804 --> 00:44:25,995
<i>Hey... Halfwit.</i>

488
00:44:27,501 --> 00:44:28,969
Halfwit.

489
00:44:29,404 --> 00:44:30,885
<i>Halfwit.</i>

490
00:44:31,556 --> 00:44:33,507
<i>Halfwit.</i>

491
00:44:36,865 --> 00:44:41,623
Why don't you just croak?

492
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:44,950
Because of you, 
we can neither sleep nor eat.

493
00:44:45,091 --> 00:44:46,560
The hell is this?

494
00:44:46,898 --> 00:44:48,497
I'm sorry, man.

495
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:50,738
"I'm sorry, man..."

496
00:44:50,846 --> 00:44:54,046
Is that all you can say?

497
00:44:54,898 --> 00:44:57,549
You're killing us in here, you prick.

498
00:44:57,608 --> 00:44:58,971
What will you do?

499
00:44:59,183 --> 00:45:02,252
I'd just step on you if I could...

500
00:45:02,899 --> 00:45:06,719
<i>Anyhow, see you outside.</i>

501
00:45:06,872 --> 00:45:09,070
After you made us go through all this,

502
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,263
think you'll be safe?

503
00:45:13,168 --> 00:45:14,231
<i>Hey... Halfwit.</i>

504
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:16,551
<i>Better keep that in mind.</i>

505
00:45:17,449 --> 00:45:19,401
Son of a bitch.

506
00:45:33,934 --> 00:45:35,439
Hey.

507
00:45:53,413 --> 00:45:55,957
<i>- Jaesuk -</i>

508
00:45:58,943 --> 00:46:01,423
Her name's Jaesuk.

509
00:46:04,021 --> 00:46:08,546
She's this girl I met at the
orphanage, when we were little.

510
00:46:09,428 --> 00:46:13,260
Her face was round as a full moon,

511
00:46:14,224 --> 00:46:16,399
you can't imagine how pretty she was.

512
00:46:16,658 --> 00:46:19,879
So that I would never forget her,

513
00:46:20,139 --> 00:46:22,591
<i>I pierced her name right here.</i>

514
00:46:26,586 --> 00:46:33,420
But I was brought here during
inspections because of this.

515
00:46:33,881 --> 00:46:36,289
Because I had a tattoo.

516
00:46:37,123 --> 00:46:40,744
I'll be damned, really...

517
00:46:41,355 --> 00:46:48,451
Having to endure all this
because of the woman you love.

518
00:46:49,938 --> 00:46:55,528
Still, when you get out,
there will be someone waiting for you.

519
00:47:00,308 --> 00:47:02,521
She died already.

520
00:47:03,367 --> 00:47:05,495
In the Gwangju riots.

521
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:13,916
<i>A bar girl stubbornly getting
all up in arms, and for what?</i>

522
00:47:14,398 --> 00:47:17,866
She wanted me to join her
and demonstrate on the streets.

523
00:47:19,829 --> 00:47:25,119
If I knew I'd be living this way,
I would have just joined her there.

524
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:31,004
<i>But, you know?</i>

525
00:47:33,115 --> 00:47:38,563
Surviving can be even more painful.

526
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:47,714
You feel so sorry for the dead...

527
00:47:52,195 --> 00:47:58,574
I'll always regret not dying
together with my Jaesuk there.

528
00:48:11,261 --> 00:48:13,342
Listen.

529
00:48:15,165 --> 00:48:19,979
Didn't you say your only sin was 
falling in love with the wrong woman?

530
00:48:21,166 --> 00:48:26,539
In this world of ours, there is
no such thing as forbidden love.

531
00:48:30,044 --> 00:48:32,646
Look at me.

532
00:48:33,634 --> 00:48:38,865
Even though Jaesuk is
no longer here with me,

533
00:48:43,995 --> 00:48:48,251
look at how much I still love her.

534
00:49:13,897 --> 00:49:19,814
<i>{\a6}- If You Live On By Deulgukhwa -

534
00:49:13,897 --> 00:49:19,814
<i>If you live on,</i>

535
00:49:20,567 --> 00:49:28,253
One day...

536
00:49:28,523 --> 00:49:37,685
- the sun will shine upon you.
- Keep quiet, you bastard!

537
00:49:39,025 --> 00:49:50,884
Even after hazy and gloomy days,

538
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:59,418
Wouldn't the sun
grace you in the morning?

539
00:50:01,546 --> 00:50:16,119
<i>Being so young and reckless
are the only riches you have,</i>

540
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:25,811
<i>So don't look down like a petty fool,</i>

541
00:50:26,179 --> 00:50:35,811
<i>And always keep your head up.</i>

542
00:50:36,998 --> 00:50:44,811
Tomorrow the sun will shine.

543
00:50:45,058 --> 00:50:52,205
It will shine upon you.

544
00:50:53,111 --> 00:51:00,419
Tomorrow the sun will shine.

545
00:51:01,253 --> 00:51:10,187
<i>It will shine upon us.</i>

546

<i>No. 534!</i>

What are you doing?

548
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:46,511
Hurry up and cross!

549
00:51:46,869 --> 00:51:49,420
<i>Quick, you bastard!</i>

550
00:51:59,001 --> 00:52:01,426
<i>No. 534.</i>

551
00:52:02,611 --> 00:52:04,635
Go, you...

552
00:52:14,852 --> 00:52:17,909
<i>Go on... Quick!</i>

553
00:52:26,654 --> 00:52:30,710
Hurry up and run, you pricks!

00:52:36,651 --> 00:52:39,261
<i>Hurry up!</i>

555
00:52:41,329 --> 00:52:44,845
Hey! Quick!

556
00:52:52,818 --> 00:52:54,922
Because of him...

557
00:52:55,028 --> 00:52:57,861
<i>it's collective punishment again.</i>

558
00:53:14,369 --> 00:53:17,422
Eat it, I'm all right.

559
00:53:23,013 --> 00:53:24,534
You eat it.

560
00:53:25,169 --> 00:53:28,940
If you want to survive and 
get out of here, you need to eat.

561
00:53:32,174 --> 00:53:33,712
Eat...

562
00:53:34,134 --> 00:53:36,273
Go ahead.

563
00:53:39,458 --> 00:53:44,301
Only those who earn
their keep should eat.

564
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:47,028
I can't even do that.

565
00:53:49,202 --> 00:53:54,904
I don't think 
I can bear it any longer.

566
00:53:58,936 --> 00:54:04,002
I can't stand to see everyone
else suffer because of me any longer.

567
00:54:04,190 --> 00:54:08,322
Forget the others and just
worry about yourself.

568
00:54:09,233 --> 00:54:11,355
You must do that here.

569
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:21,939
I miss Jaesuk so much,
it's driving me crazy.

570
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:39,031
I miss her so much,
I can't even eat anymore.

571
00:54:45,130 --> 00:54:47,799
Jaesuk, I'm sorry...

572
00:54:49,575 --> 00:54:54,053
You died because of me.

573
00:55:40,656 --> 00:55:43,054
Jaesuk...

574
00:55:44,606 --> 00:55:46,816
It's me...

575
00:55:47,773 --> 00:55:49,320
I said it's me.

576
00:55:49,566 --> 00:55:51,802
Jaesuk!

577
00:55:53,266 --> 00:55:55,411
Jaesuk.

578
00:57:00,736 --> 00:57:03,406
Ahh... That prick...

579
00:57:03,559 --> 00:57:05,498
He's a nuisance even when dead.

580
00:57:05,651 --> 00:57:07,709
How could there never be 
a day of peace here?

581
00:57:07,814 --> 00:57:11,282
Chief Inmate?
I've had it with this!

582
00:57:11,552 --> 00:57:13,645
Someone just died.

583
00:57:14,562 --> 00:57:16,889
Is that all you can say?

584
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:21,697
Say what?

585
00:57:21,873 --> 00:57:24,133
No. 534.

586
00:57:24,450 --> 00:57:26,354
You killed him.

587
00:57:26,707 --> 00:57:29,634
You were pretty much
responsible for his death!

588
00:57:34,279 --> 00:57:37,041
Did you go batty 
in groups or something?

589
00:57:37,170 --> 00:57:40,097
<i>He made it just as hard
for you, you pricks!</i>

590
00:57:40,238 --> 00:57:42,730
Wouldn't getting rid of him solve...

591
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:46,492
Look at you people.

592
00:57:48,542 --> 00:57:51,250
I'm Chief Inmate here, you pricks!

593
00:57:51,344 --> 00:57:56,037
This... Uh?
Can't you see this?

594
00:57:59,396 --> 00:58:01,759
I'm sorry!

595
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:05,229
