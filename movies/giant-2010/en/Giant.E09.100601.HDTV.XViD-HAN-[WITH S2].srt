~ Episode 9 ~

5
00:00:26,385 --> 00:00:28,018
Always on time, aren't you?

6
00:00:28,131 --> 00:00:30,073
Why even bother coming...

7
00:00:33,689 --> 00:00:36,008
This place is filled with the cream of
the financial and political world's crop.

8
00:00:36,146 --> 00:00:39,001
Having an illegitimate daughter
can only bring embarrassment to us,

9
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:42,367
so keep quiet and don't
attract people's attention.

10
00:00:49,881 --> 00:00:51,739
Here you are, Jeongyeon.

11
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,419
She's my daughter.

12
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,089
How are you?
I'm Hwang Jeongyeon.

13
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:02,893
I see your daughter took
after her mother's beauty.

14
00:01:03,562 --> 00:01:05,074
Yes...

15
00:01:05,376 --> 00:01:10,163
Also, our new chief 
of planning, Jo Minwoo.

16
00:01:10,326 --> 00:01:12,248
We already introduced each other.

17
00:01:12,347 --> 00:01:13,893
<i>Is that so?</i>

18
00:01:14,155 --> 00:01:18,621
He'll be your superior at work.

19
00:01:20,267 --> 00:01:23,269
I'm not working for your company.

20
00:01:23,382 --> 00:01:25,289
Shut it, you silly.

21
00:01:26,491 --> 00:01:32,057
Don't mind her being my daughter,
and treat her like all the others.

22
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,311
Do you know where the construction 
committee members are?

23
00:01:58,423 --> 00:02:01,615
They're all gathered at the Royal Club.

24
00:02:05,107 --> 00:02:07,934
If you can't make it into the committee,

25
00:02:08,084 --> 00:02:11,326
you can forget the subway bid altogether.

26
00:02:11,956 --> 00:02:13,919
That's indeed what would happen.

27
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:19,679
Since those who aren't members of the
committee are excluded from the bidding.

28
00:02:19,866 --> 00:02:24,001
Chairman Hwang.
What are you, acting indifferent now?

29
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,447
Director.

30
00:02:25,584 --> 00:02:28,714
I talked on the phone 
with the members myself.

31
00:02:28,851 --> 00:02:30,958
They assured me they would come,

32
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:32,654
so there must be a reason...

33
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:36,754
You still don't get it?

34
00:02:40,514 --> 00:02:46,529
By now, Hong Gipyo must be
laughing at you at the Royal Club.

35
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:55,689
By now, Hwang Taeseop must
be in panic, waiting for us.

36
00:02:57,306 --> 00:03:00,792
I'm sure he's all shaking, already.

37
00:03:01,823 --> 00:03:03,842
Manbo Construction's tenth anniversary?!

38
00:03:04,004 --> 00:03:06,961
Imagine how dreary that party will feel.

39
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:10,451
If you lose this bid,

40
00:03:10,559 --> 00:03:15,014
how are you going to fund my campaign 
at the next assembly elections?

41
00:03:18,017 --> 00:03:21,062
The game starts now.

42
00:03:21,933 --> 00:03:25,488
Why are you so impatient?
It doesn't suit you.

43
00:03:25,725 --> 00:03:27,097
What?

44
00:03:28,061 --> 00:03:30,368
Look, Chairman Hwang!

45
00:03:37,327 --> 00:03:40,304
Hey... Hey...
What are you doing?

46
00:03:42,249 --> 00:03:43,084
Chairman.

47
00:03:43,258 --> 00:03:45,104
I'll head to the Royal Club.

48
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:50,054
It all depends on you now.

49
00:03:50,726 --> 00:03:52,597
I will accept no mistakes.

50
00:03:52,734 --> 00:03:54,604
Yes, Chairman.

51
00:04:05,898 --> 00:04:10,721
You knew they were
gathered at the Royal Club?

52
00:04:10,946 --> 00:04:12,098
Director.

53
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:15,078
Can I borrow some of 
your time later tonight?

54
00:04:15,253 --> 00:04:19,293
I'll treat you to 
a really nice spectacle.

55
00:04:33,818 --> 00:04:35,439
Where are you going?

56
00:04:38,877 --> 00:04:40,338
Bring me home, will you?

57
00:04:40,487 --> 00:04:41,884
I'm sorry.

58
00:04:42,058 --> 00:04:44,673
I already have instructions
from the chairman.

59
00:04:45,263 --> 00:04:46,999
Too bad, then.

60
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,336
Guess I'll grab a taxi.

61
00:04:49,913 --> 00:04:52,209
What are those instructions?

62
00:05:19,043 --> 00:05:22,926
Agasshi.

63
00:05:27,806 --> 00:05:31,442
Dressing to make men believe
you're an easy woman is no fun.

64
00:05:41,692 --> 00:05:44,173
Tomorrow's your first day, 
so don't be late.

65
00:05:57,237 --> 00:06:01,738
Have you seen how dirty that car is? 
You idiot...

66
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:04,225
- Make it shine.
- Yes.

67
00:06:10,935 --> 00:06:13,653
I'll bring the 
committee members by myself,

68
00:06:13,847 --> 00:06:15,374
so just stay here.

69
00:06:15,977 --> 00:06:18,713
This is a very important matter.

70
00:06:22,939 --> 00:06:24,804
What's that supposed to mean?

71
00:06:25,589 --> 00:06:28,769
That it's something I shouldn't
bother with, and leave to you?

72
00:06:28,906 --> 00:06:31,697
The chairman directly instructed me.

73
00:06:31,822 --> 00:06:33,605
You little prick...

74
00:06:37,573 --> 00:06:40,268
How dare you stare back?

75
00:06:40,495 --> 00:06:42,575
Young Master, please...
Stop, please.

76
00:06:42,737 --> 00:06:46,377
Don't stop him.
I'll give you three minutes.

77
00:06:46,626 --> 00:06:48,659
It's all I can spare, 
because of the chairman's orders.

78
00:06:48,821 --> 00:06:51,072
I ought to just...

79
00:06:55,299 --> 00:06:56,633
You...

80
00:06:56,982 --> 00:07:00,137
I'll see you after I'm
done with the committee.

81
00:07:00,615 --> 00:07:03,516
Start the car, 
what are you waiting for?

82
00:07:05,345 --> 00:07:08,462
Only if I go 
we'll manage to bring them here.

83
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,118
Enough with the insolence, you prick!

84
00:07:11,754 --> 00:07:14,809
I'm the son of Manbo
Construction's chairman.

85
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:19,103
The heir is going himself,
think he wouldn't manage?

86
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,297
Ahh... You fool...

87
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:24,788
Let's go.

88
00:07:39,286 --> 00:07:42,241
So how does working here feel?

89
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:43,763
Are you managing all right?

90
00:07:44,087 --> 00:07:46,442
I'm still learning the ropes.

91
00:07:46,704 --> 00:07:51,165
It was an order from the director
so I was forced to take you in,

92
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:56,092
but to be honest, I don't like you.

93
00:07:57,516 --> 00:08:00,083
Is it because of your personal
feelings against Director Jo Pilyeon?

94
00:08:00,233 --> 00:08:06,504
Is there anyone in the KCIA who doesn't
know you're Jo Pilyeon's right-hand man?

95
00:08:08,163 --> 00:08:11,105
Even a beginner knows
that no personal feelings...

96
00:08:11,317 --> 00:08:13,708
should interfere with one's duties.

97
00:08:13,808 --> 00:08:15,479
What are you,

98
00:08:16,565 --> 00:08:18,783
suggesting I'm worse than a beginner?

99
00:08:18,908 --> 00:08:21,863
Whatever your relationship is,
it doesn't concern me.

100
00:08:22,012 --> 00:08:26,588
I merely work for the sake
of our country and the people.

101
00:08:26,763 --> 00:08:28,766
You may leave.

102
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:37,652
Insolent bastard...

103
00:08:40,832 --> 00:08:42,203
Seonbaenim.

104
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:45,395
We just got word that someone
from Manbo Construction...

105
00:08:45,545 --> 00:08:50,145
is making his move towards the Royal Club, 
where the committee is gathered.

106
00:08:51,205 --> 00:08:53,399
- Thanks.
- Seonbaenim.

107
00:08:53,562 --> 00:08:55,733
Are you going there?

108
00:08:55,957 --> 00:08:57,869
What are you investigating these days?

109
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:00,421
Let's have a drink later.

110
00:09:01,411 --> 00:09:03,125
Seonbaenim.

111
00:09:06,842 --> 00:09:09,144
How are you?

112
00:09:18,442 --> 00:09:20,517
- Ma'am.
- It's been a while.

113
00:09:21,481 --> 00:09:23,664
<i>Do you even know who I am?</i>

114
00:09:23,801 --> 00:09:26,282
I'm the son of Manbo
Construction's chairman, you fools!

115
00:09:26,382 --> 00:09:31,307
Uh? Let me go, let me go!

116
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,233
What is the matter?

117
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:38,383
He was here to escort
the committee members out.

118
00:09:40,222 --> 00:09:43,807
Don't tell them I'm here.

119
00:09:44,106 --> 00:09:45,428
Yes.

120
00:09:49,081 --> 00:09:51,103
I said I'm the son of
Manbo Construction's chairman!

121
00:09:51,228 --> 00:09:53,472
Hey... You're embarrassing me...
Let go!

122
00:09:53,572 --> 00:09:55,953
<i>Hey... You'll ruin my clothes!</i>

123
00:09:56,127 --> 00:09:59,020
<i>Let go! Let me go!</i>

124
00:10:06,514 --> 00:10:09,333
Seems like Hwang Taeseop 
panicked, all right.

125
00:10:09,451 --> 00:10:12,386
Sending here that foolish son of his...

126
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:17,321
I guess he was impatient to join 
the bid for the subway construction.

127
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:22,232
I trust no one here would approve
of his entrance into the committee?!

128
00:10:22,407 --> 00:10:27,456
I'm against it. 
The five of us more than suffice.

129
00:10:27,631 --> 00:10:29,027
Same goes for me.

130
00:10:29,152 --> 00:10:33,682
All Chairman Hwang needs to gain entry 
is the approval of three members.

131
00:10:33,831 --> 00:10:39,852
You will find no traitor here, 
so you can spare yourself the concern.

132
00:10:42,489 --> 00:10:45,302
Gentlemen, have some of this.

133
00:10:45,477 --> 00:10:49,739
Kiddo, tell your boss 
to show up, will you?

134
00:10:49,835 --> 00:10:53,217
I've been to just about
every luxury bar in town,

135
00:10:53,354 --> 00:10:56,609
<i>{\a6}*slang for female owner
of bar/room saloon</i>

136
00:10:53,354 --> 00:10:56,609
but I've never seen one with
such haughty madam* before.

137
00:10:56,883 --> 00:10:58,267
<i>I'd drop the curiosity, if I were you.</i>

138
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:02,320
There are rumors that the owner here 
is Baekpa's adoptive daughter.

139
00:11:02,622 --> 00:11:04,115
By Baekpa...

140
00:11:04,277 --> 00:11:07,712
You mean Myeongdong's biggest
private lender, that Baekpa?

141
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:11,101
Yes. There is likely no
business in this country...

142
00:11:11,239 --> 00:11:13,740
that hasn't borrowed money 
from him at least once.

143
00:11:13,865 --> 00:11:19,520
Wow... We'll have to be careful
what we say, this place is scary!

144
00:11:20,344 --> 00:11:22,057
Let's have a drink, shall we?

145
00:11:22,194 --> 00:11:24,122
<i>Let's do that.</i>

146
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:31,256
<i>There is a call for
the committee members.</i>

147
00:11:31,938 --> 00:11:34,710
Is it the son of Manbo
Construction's chairman?

148
00:11:34,947 --> 00:11:38,064
<i>It's another voice.</i>

149
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,826
Let him through.

150
00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:46,543
- Yes.
- Is that Chairman Hong Gipyo?

151
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:49,248
That's right.
Who am I speaking to?

152
00:11:49,398 --> 00:11:52,963
<i>Could I speak with Chairman Cheon 
of Gwangmyeong Construction?</i>

153
00:11:54,036 --> 00:11:55,307
Chairman Cheon.

154
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,097
There's a call for you.

155
00:11:57,196 --> 00:11:59,297
- Me?!
- Yes.

156
00:11:59,411 --> 00:12:02,126
I wasn't expecting any?!

157
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:07,625
- I'll take over for you, if I may.
- Sure.

158
00:12:11,358 --> 00:12:13,457
It's me, Chairman Cheon.

159
00:12:13,719 --> 00:12:18,157
I trust you remember that
Chairman Hong once gave up his bid...

160
00:12:18,307 --> 00:12:22,446
<i>because of a fire 
at his company warehouse?</i>

161
00:12:23,074 --> 00:12:27,273
Ask him directly, why should I...

162
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:33,309
<i>Is he aware that the man who set his
warehouse on fire was your secretary?</i>

163
00:12:39,142 --> 00:12:42,263
Who... Who are you?

164
00:12:44,026 --> 00:12:50,068
And thanks to that,
your company won the bid.

165
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:52,765
<i>I asked who are you!</i>

166
00:12:52,927 --> 00:12:54,136
Let me get straight to the point.

167
00:12:54,261 --> 00:12:56,418
Come outside right now.

168
00:12:56,739 --> 00:13:01,368
Ahh... Can I talk to Chairman Baek
of Honghae Construction?

169
00:13:01,672 --> 00:13:03,737
Just a moment.

170
00:13:04,495 --> 00:13:06,615
Chairman Baek, get the phone.

171
00:13:06,764 --> 00:13:08,198
I'll have to get going.

172
00:13:08,348 --> 00:13:09,071
Where are you going?

173
00:13:09,245 --> 00:13:14,170
Something urgent at work needs
my presence, so have a good night.

174
00:13:15,163 --> 00:13:16,926
Who is it?

175
00:13:19,904 --> 00:13:21,891
<i>What is this all about?!</i>

176
00:13:22,527 --> 00:13:23,844
Hello.

177
00:13:24,006 --> 00:13:26,088
I'm Chairman Baek, who is it?

178
00:13:26,225 --> 00:13:30,290
<i>You're in-laws 
with Chairman Cheon, right?</i>

179
00:13:31,702 --> 00:13:33,266
Why do you ask?

180
00:13:33,966 --> 00:13:38,066
I hear that your daughter is hiding
a child she had before marriage...

181
00:13:38,415 --> 00:13:41,707
I'm sure your in-laws
aren't aware of that?!

182
00:13:42,118 --> 00:13:44,026
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

183
00:13:44,599 --> 00:13:47,372
<i>We need to go somewhere right now.</i>

184
00:13:47,584 --> 00:13:49,616
<i>Will you come out and follow me?</i>

185
00:13:50,003 --> 00:13:52,628
<i>Fine, wait just a moment.</i>

186
00:13:55,177 --> 00:13:58,032
Something came up for me as well, 
so I need to go.

187
00:13:58,162 --> 00:14:01,055
Chairman Jo, pick up the phone.

188
00:14:04,546 --> 00:14:08,398
What call could it possibly be, 
to react this way?

189
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:11,141
Yes, Chairman Jo speaking.

190
00:14:15,974 --> 00:14:19,061
Let's meet right now.

191
00:15:08,938 --> 00:15:13,377
But where are you taking us?

192
00:15:14,085 --> 00:15:16,070
The chairman is waiting for you.

193
00:15:16,257 --> 00:15:19,436
Who is this chairman?

194
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:23,617
Who ordered you to take us there 
without our consent?

195
00:15:24,475 --> 00:15:28,211
Didn't you give your consent,
by spontaneously entering this car?

196
00:15:30,894 --> 00:15:33,142
We're late, so I'll have to speed up.

197
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:53,272
Can you really bring
the committee members here?

198
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,217
<i>Chairman.</i>

199
00:15:55,392 --> 00:15:56,950
<i>Your guests are here.</i>

200
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,382
See them in.

201
00:16:05,779 --> 00:16:07,274
Come on in.

202
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:10,715
Here, have a seat.

203
00:16:12,822 --> 00:16:14,580
Please, sit.

204
00:16:21,242 --> 00:16:22,493
<i>Good job.</i>

205
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,275
You can go.

206
00:16:30,846 --> 00:16:35,459
Thank you for so kindly
accepting my invitation.

207
00:16:35,807 --> 00:16:40,081
Let me make the introductions.

208
00:16:41,095 --> 00:16:47,120
Here's the Director of the KCIA's 
Inspection Department, Jo Pilyeon.

209
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,505
Is that so?

210
00:16:51,079 --> 00:16:53,348
Allow me to introduce myself.

211
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:57,434
<i>I'm Chairman Cheon Suman 
of Gwangmyeong Construction.</i>

212
00:17:04,576 --> 00:17:05,998
Gangmo... Gangmo.

213
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,803
Jeongshik is here.

214
00:17:12,546 --> 00:17:14,700
<i>Just stay put.</i>

215
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:18,861
- I said don't!
- I told you I'm loaded.

216
00:17:27,887 --> 00:17:29,832
And who is this?

217
00:17:32,537 --> 00:17:34,841
Come here, I'll pour you a drink.

218
00:17:43,682 --> 00:17:45,727
Here, have a drink.

219
00:17:50,595 --> 00:17:55,274
Why, thought I'd offer drinks 
to our backyard mutt?

220
00:17:55,835 --> 00:17:57,206
Know who this is?

221
00:17:57,381 --> 00:18:01,021
Know mutts, right? Mutts.

222
00:18:04,413 --> 00:18:06,133
The chairman...

223
00:18:06,769 --> 00:18:09,939
is here with the construction
committee members.

224
00:18:10,575 --> 00:18:11,584
What?

225
00:18:11,821 --> 00:18:14,826
Don't fool around 
and let him see you here.

226
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:17,257
I won't be able to cover up for that.

227
00:18:17,594 --> 00:18:20,531
Don't be so arrogant with me, you prick!

228
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:24,427
Think that just because you're
as loyal to my father as a dog,

229
00:18:24,626 --> 00:18:26,970
he will save a position
in the company for you?

230
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,087
<i>That's never going 
to happen, and know why?</i>

231
00:18:30,986 --> 00:18:36,414
Because I will inherit 
my father's company.

232
00:18:37,378 --> 00:18:42,287
When that happens,
you're the first head to roll, got it?

233
00:18:59,577 --> 00:19:04,516
I'll get straight to the point,
and tell you I'll have to be entrusted...

234
00:19:04,682 --> 00:19:07,171
with the upcoming subway construction.

235
00:19:09,298 --> 00:19:14,889
To make sure that happens, I first
need to be accepted into the committee...

236
00:19:15,163 --> 00:19:21,892
As you're well aware, Chairman Hong Gipyo 
presides over our committee.

237
00:19:22,104 --> 00:19:26,848
You're like sworn enemies, so...

238
00:19:27,054 --> 00:19:28,725
Chairman Cheon.

239
00:19:29,485 --> 00:19:33,783
Isn't a majority vote 
all you need to enter a committee?

240
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:38,734
All I need is for you three
to push for my acceptance.

241
00:19:39,393 --> 00:19:40,528
About that...

242
00:19:40,641 --> 00:19:42,723
According to the rules,
that's indeed possible.

243
00:19:42,922 --> 00:19:45,625
- Director Ju?
- Yes, Chairman.

244
00:20:02,917 --> 00:20:06,470
Please sign the acceptance agreement.

245
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:08,540
Chairman Hwang...

246
00:20:08,689 --> 00:20:16,008
We already decided to grant
Daeryuk Construction the subway project.

247
00:20:16,195 --> 00:20:20,131
Decisions can always be overturned.

248
00:20:20,272 --> 00:20:21,644
Chairman Hwang.

249
00:20:21,806 --> 00:20:24,531
This would put us in
a difficult position, so...

250
00:20:25,222 --> 00:20:27,078
Director.

251
00:20:27,414 --> 00:20:34,297
Isn't the KCIA Inspection Department
where they torture criminals?

252
00:20:34,521 --> 00:20:41,406
Why... Anyone to report in particular?

253
00:20:41,742 --> 00:20:43,824
No.

254
00:20:45,425 --> 00:20:52,228
Is there anyone who has never 
committed a crime or two before?

255
00:21:29,849 --> 00:21:32,634
He's changed, we're not dealing 
with the same Chairman Hwang.

256
00:21:32,784 --> 00:21:37,144
- Isn't that all for the better?
- If he doesn't overstep his boundaries...

257
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:43,802
What is your name?

258
00:21:44,849 --> 00:21:46,345
Lee Gangmo.

259
00:21:47,475 --> 00:21:48,739
You're quite skilled.

260
00:21:48,876 --> 00:21:50,633
Clean and effective.

261
00:21:50,845 --> 00:21:53,650
If you'll excuse me, I'll get going.

262
00:21:59,162 --> 00:22:02,166
He dug through an impenetrable fortress
like the committee in a matter of moments.

263
00:22:02,316 --> 00:22:04,150
He's no ordinary underling.

264
00:22:04,855 --> 00:22:06,945
Keep your eyes on him.

265
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:08,776
I will.

266
00:22:16,211 --> 00:22:19,498
Come on in.

267
00:22:21,951 --> 00:22:23,974
So...

268
00:22:28,636 --> 00:22:30,158
Here.

269
00:22:32,372 --> 00:22:34,208
You did well.

270
00:22:34,632 --> 00:22:36,839
A really good job.

271
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:38,622
Thank you.

272
00:22:46,024 --> 00:22:50,029
There is something I'd like to ask you.

273
00:22:50,861 --> 00:22:55,690
I'd like be entrusted 
the subway bid's leadership.

274
00:22:56,189 --> 00:22:59,600
Want to wear necktie and suit?

275
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,281
Didn't you promise me?

276
00:23:02,687 --> 00:23:05,448
I've already made enough experience 
at the bottom of the ladder.

277
00:23:06,084 --> 00:23:08,877
Allow me to do real work
for your company now.

278
00:23:09,001 --> 00:23:10,423
It's still too early for you.

279
00:23:10,596 --> 00:23:11,931
Chairman.

280
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,702
Everything has its timing and due course.

281
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:20,019
And it's not your time, yet.

282
00:23:20,231 --> 00:23:23,048
I think I did enough to prove myself.

283
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,729
And that's just what you think.

284
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,860
Go out and start the car.

285
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:30,644
Chairman!

286
00:23:30,768 --> 00:23:32,713
I said leave!

287
00:23:35,481 --> 00:23:36,965
Yes.

288
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:50,379
Let alone what he did for us this time,

289
00:23:50,628 --> 00:23:53,683
hasn't Gangmo proven himself
enough to be granted that?

290
00:23:53,882 --> 00:23:58,657
The more you strike it,
the stronger iron becomes.

291
00:23:58,931 --> 00:24:02,933
He needs to experience the bottom
of the ladder a little longer.

292
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:09,727
Only then we'll be able to use him 
for what he's truly worth later.

293
00:24:36,122 --> 00:24:38,364
Let go!

294
00:24:38,513 --> 00:24:39,835
- You wench!
- What are you doing?

295
00:24:39,947 --> 00:24:42,825
Even you look down on me, now?

296
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:44,760
What's wrong with you?

297
00:24:44,885 --> 00:24:45,770
Enough!

298
00:24:45,845 --> 00:24:49,697
Aigoo, this is too much!
Now even minions look down on me!

299
00:24:49,847 --> 00:24:52,417
I can't take this anymore!

300
00:24:52,739 --> 00:24:53,764
What's wrong, again?

301
00:24:53,901 --> 00:24:56,332
She kept looking for the bottle.

302
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:58,528
I told her to stop, and she just...

303
00:24:58,619 --> 00:24:59,736
And who the hell are you?

304
00:24:59,836 --> 00:25:01,469
Did I steal your bottle or something?

305
00:25:01,569 --> 00:25:03,551
How dare you try to order me around?

306
00:25:03,663 --> 00:25:05,595
Give it a rest!

307
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:07,124
You may leave.

308
00:25:07,261 --> 00:25:08,982
Yes...

309
00:25:12,067 --> 00:25:14,293
You're drunk.
Just go to sleep.

310
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:17,609
When you die, think that
brat Jeongyeon is going to...

311
00:25:17,735 --> 00:25:20,929
pour a drink at your altar
and honor your passing?

312
00:25:21,053 --> 00:25:24,083
<i>Jeongshik is our eldest son!</i>

313
00:25:24,258 --> 00:25:27,100
If she gets married,
we'll become strangers.

314
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:28,737
All right, I get it.

315
00:25:28,856 --> 00:25:30,666
I got it, so now go to sleep.

316
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,964
And what is Jeongyeon
going to do in your company?

317
00:25:33,101 --> 00:25:35,869
Are you going to let her 
inherit the whole thing?

318
00:25:37,183 --> 00:25:39,560
Then, what about Jeongshik...

319
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:43,674
Can't you see him always lounging
around with nothing better to do?

320
00:25:43,836 --> 00:25:45,907
And who sold off raw
materials and ran away,

321
00:25:46,069 --> 00:25:48,301
when I gave him the chance
to supervise a construction?

322
00:25:48,425 --> 00:25:51,617
So? Are you going to keep him 
out of the company forever?

323
00:25:51,742 --> 00:25:53,512
Ahh... Really...

324
00:25:53,961 --> 00:25:57,124
Just be honest.

325
00:25:57,774 --> 00:26:00,490
Just say that you still
can't forget that wench.

326
00:26:00,929 --> 00:26:02,647
Jeongyeon's mother,
that promiscuous bitch!

327
00:26:02,834 --> 00:26:05,739
<i>You're still thinking
about her, aren't you?</i>

328
00:26:05,963 --> 00:26:08,445
<i>Why bring up the dead?</i>

329
00:26:08,632 --> 00:26:11,898
<i>Because the living envy them, why?</i>

330
00:26:12,085 --> 00:26:15,512
Just my luck...
What did I do to deserve this?

331
00:26:15,661 --> 00:26:19,028
So stop getting piss drunk
all the time, will you?

332
00:26:19,177 --> 00:26:22,581
<i>I've lost all will to live, really...</i>

333
00:26:23,017 --> 00:26:27,056
<i>Jeongshik...
What about my poor Jeongshik...</i>

334
00:27:01,514 --> 00:27:05,354
Seems like Chairman Hwang will
gain entrance into the committee.

335
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,067
I'm surprised.

336
00:27:10,266 --> 00:27:11,924
I thought it wouldn't be easy for him.

337
00:27:12,074 --> 00:27:15,353
There's this young fella under him, 
a certain Lee Gangmo.

338
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:17,460
He's responsible for this.

339
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,393
To succeed, you need 
talented people by your side.

340
00:27:22,689 --> 00:27:27,227
Using that Lee Gangmo
will benefit you for sure.

341
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:33,898
Aren't you dating anyone?

342
00:27:36,217 --> 00:27:37,622
I'm not in any serious relationship,

343
00:27:37,821 --> 00:27:39,928
but I'm seeing a few women.

344
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:44,354
You know, Chairman Hwang's daughter.

345
00:27:44,691 --> 00:27:46,786
Was it Jeongyeon?

346
00:27:47,023 --> 00:27:48,926
She sure is pretty.

347
00:27:49,803 --> 00:27:52,076
The streets are filled
with women looking like her.

348
00:27:52,282 --> 00:27:54,607
Show some interest in her.

349
00:27:57,774 --> 00:28:01,178
Why, you don't like her?

350
00:28:02,295 --> 00:28:06,758
If you need me to,
I'll show some interest.

351
00:28:17,861 --> 00:28:19,941
Goddamned brat.

352
00:28:20,051 --> 00:28:23,070
Does she think she can 
just toy around with my hair?

353
00:28:23,219 --> 00:28:25,676
She's ruined them so bad 
I can't even comb them anymore.

354
00:28:26,419 --> 00:28:30,784
I told you to avoid her when she's drunk.

355
00:28:31,218 --> 00:28:35,210
If only your father hadn't lost his 
land in Maljukgeori from gambling,

356
00:28:35,397 --> 00:28:38,113
I wouldn't have had to live this way.

357
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:43,227
<i>Why is that damned land
in Gangnam skyrocketing?</i>

358
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,948
Gangmo.

359
00:28:45,235 --> 00:28:46,416
<i>Come on out.</i>

360
00:28:46,553 --> 00:28:49,720
The chairman is really angry 
because of his daughter.

361
00:28:49,932 --> 00:28:51,491
<i>Come on.</i>

362
00:29:02,183 --> 00:29:05,933
Go fetch Jeongyeon at school, 
and send her to work.

363
00:29:06,114 --> 00:29:07,978
I will, Chairman.

364
00:29:08,238 --> 00:29:09,723
Right.

365
00:29:10,634 --> 00:29:13,865
Have a nice day, Honey.

366
00:29:34,381 --> 00:29:36,674
And how are you going to convince
someone as stubborn as she is,

367
00:29:36,787 --> 00:29:38,908
when even her father can't?

368
00:29:44,196 --> 00:29:46,993
Anyhow, when Jeongyeon gets there,

369
00:29:47,155 --> 00:29:52,142
report to me in detail about
what she does and who she meets.

370
00:29:52,279 --> 00:29:54,499
You don't need to worry, Ma'am.

371
00:29:54,786 --> 00:29:57,738
I'll be counting on you, then.

372
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:04,421
Go ahead and try me.

373
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:09,499
Think I'll let you prance around
the company all day in peace?

374
00:30:12,123 --> 00:30:13,756
<i>~ Let's Protect Our Democracy ~</i>

375
00:30:19,941 --> 00:30:22,160
<i>~ Overthrow the Dictators! ~</i>

376
00:30:50,308 --> 00:30:52,543
<i>Let's go to work.</i>

377
00:30:53,292 --> 00:30:55,178
I'm not going to work there.

378
00:30:59,284 --> 00:31:01,916
Hey! Let...

379
00:31:02,779 --> 00:31:05,117
Which faculty and year?

380
00:31:06,792 --> 00:31:09,411
<i>{\a6}*peurakchi: loanword from
the Russian fraktsiya</i>

381
00:31:06,792 --> 00:31:09,411
You're a police informant*, right?

382
00:31:10,764 --> 00:31:12,253
Let's hear it.

383
00:31:12,732 --> 00:31:14,074
Who is this?

384
00:31:16,754 --> 00:31:19,091
Someone I don't know.

385
00:31:22,508 --> 00:31:24,337
Let go!

386
00:31:39,711 --> 00:31:41,269
I...

387
00:31:42,498 --> 00:31:45,534
am neither an informant nor a student.

388
00:31:47,853 --> 00:31:50,396
Go ahead and mind your business.

389
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:52,990
I will take care of my own.

390
00:32:00,872 --> 00:32:02,093
Are you out of your mind?

391
00:32:02,305 --> 00:32:03,639
What do you think you're doing?

392
00:32:03,826 --> 00:32:05,385
Agasshi.

393
00:32:05,734 --> 00:32:08,651
We're at school.
Don't call me that.

394
00:32:09,781 --> 00:32:14,297
Do you plan on wagging your tail
around my father like Jeongshik said?

395
00:32:14,497 --> 00:32:17,502
Is this what you took that GED for?

396
00:32:17,726 --> 00:32:20,594
There are plenty of people who
are having it much harder than you.

397
00:32:20,818 --> 00:32:23,449
Think they all live like you?

398
00:32:26,268 --> 00:32:29,438
Do you even know 
what having it hard means?

399
00:32:30,431 --> 00:32:32,954
Ever starved with 
nothing to eat whatsoever?

400
00:32:34,899 --> 00:32:37,941
Ever cried bitter tears for all
the unfairness surrounding you?

401
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,123
You can scream and
blame this world all you want,

402
00:32:40,248 --> 00:32:41,490
but nobody will listen to you.

403
00:32:41,639 --> 00:32:44,756
If you think your life is unfair, 
just find success.

404
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:51,115
I might look pathetic in your eyes, 
but this is the best for me.

405
00:32:51,405 --> 00:32:54,295
Since I'll climb the ladder and succeed, 
just like your father did.

406
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:57,360
Don't even try 
acting like that with me.

407
00:32:57,510 --> 00:33:01,275
I won't leave your side no matter what.

408
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,360
Here.

409
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,476
Let's go now, Agasshi.

410
00:33:17,137 --> 00:33:19,602
Start by wiping that blood.

411
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,640
<i>What is this?</i>

412
00:33:42,827 --> 00:33:46,094
It's a detailed report on the
land we're about to acquire.

413
00:33:46,256 --> 00:33:52,015
I thought I asked you 
for a plan for the subway bid?

414
00:33:52,177 --> 00:33:53,886
Once that subway opens to the public,

415
00:33:54,048 --> 00:33:56,629
the price of land in
the area will skyrocket.

416
00:33:56,828 --> 00:34:01,292
The best course of action
would be buying land in the area first.

417
00:34:01,628 --> 00:34:02,838
Is that so?

418
00:34:03,025 --> 00:34:06,007
Daeryuk Construction already
secured a significant portion.

419
00:34:06,331 --> 00:34:10,084
If we don't rush,
there will be nothing left to buy.

420
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:17,190
I'll give you carte blanche
over the entire bid.

421
00:34:17,589 --> 00:34:20,583
<i>I'll give you all the support you need,</i>

422
00:34:20,732 --> 00:34:25,092
so let's witness your skills in action.

423
00:34:25,445 --> 00:34:27,178
Thank you, Chairman.

424
00:34:28,763 --> 00:34:31,555
I wouldn't be so fast
to thank me, if I were you...

425
00:34:31,792 --> 00:34:34,121
<i>Because as strong 
a support as I promised,</i>

426
00:34:34,258 --> 00:34:39,607
so will be the repercussions if you fail.

427
00:34:39,794 --> 00:34:43,534
I will make sure you
will not be disappointed.

428
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:51,051
About Jeongyeon.

429
00:34:51,624 --> 00:34:55,826
I leave that kid to your care.

430
00:34:56,237 --> 00:35:00,129
I'll take that as helping her
experience what the real world means.

431
00:35:11,777 --> 00:35:17,840
Jo Pilyeon raised his boy quite well.

432
00:35:29,631 --> 00:35:33,177
Can't you find your way here 
without Lee Gangmo's help?

433
00:35:34,338 --> 00:35:36,755
Three late arrivals 
will result in a pay cut,

434
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:39,498
and two absences without leave
will result in immediate termination.

435
00:35:39,673 --> 00:35:41,044
Hey, Jo Minwoo!

436
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:43,525
- Who the hell are you, to...
- I...

437
00:35:45,632 --> 00:35:47,876
am your direct superior.

438
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:53,624
I will no longer tolerate you 
insulting your father's name this way.

439
00:35:53,898 --> 00:35:55,487
Did I make myself clear?

440
00:35:55,812 --> 00:35:57,320
<i>Also.</i>

441
00:35:58,118 --> 00:36:00,998
Address your superior
with such insolence again,

442
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:04,571
and it won't just end with 
a few tears down your face.

443
00:36:09,304 --> 00:36:11,605
You can return to the service lobby.

444
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:15,657
The chairman ordered me 
to look after Agasshi...

445
00:36:15,781 --> 00:36:17,851
You still don't get it?

446
00:36:18,637 --> 00:36:24,033
Your "Agasshi" is now under my care.

447
00:36:26,402 --> 00:36:28,410
You will soon receive new orders.

448
00:36:28,671 --> 00:36:30,903
Go wait downstairs.

449
00:36:37,137 --> 00:36:39,116
From now on, if you want to meet me,

450
00:36:39,241 --> 00:36:41,361
follow procedure like everyone else.

451
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:45,737
Coming here as you please 
ends today, you silly.

452
00:36:49,614 --> 00:36:51,862
And what is this?

453
00:36:52,005 --> 00:36:54,211
An eligibility confirmation
from Daeryuk Construction.

454
00:36:54,448 --> 00:36:56,642
I passed their entrance test.

455
00:36:57,066 --> 00:36:57,715
You did what?

456
00:36:57,852 --> 00:37:01,743
Now you know why I said
I won't work here, right?

457
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:06,381
I see... 
You want to make a deal with me.

458
00:37:06,506 --> 00:37:08,064
Is that what you think?

459
00:37:08,214 --> 00:37:12,660
You chose business 
administration on your own.

460
00:37:12,822 --> 00:37:15,341
And your grades were quite good as well.

461
00:37:15,565 --> 00:37:21,612
<i>You were well aware that I wanted
you here much more than Jeongshik.</i>

462
00:37:21,829 --> 00:37:26,380
Was it just a ploy 
to make me concerned?

463
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:29,319
Whatever you think,
it doesn't concern me.

464
00:37:29,456 --> 00:37:32,174
Because the choice 
always remains with me.

465
00:37:32,964 --> 00:37:35,765
My daughter is really something.

466
00:37:36,426 --> 00:37:45,019
Fine... Every deal depends on
who takes the initiative first.

467
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:48,972
All right, let's get started.

468
00:37:49,171 --> 00:37:51,577
What is it that you want from me?

469
00:37:52,343 --> 00:37:56,066
I can't let you join Daeryuk Construction.

470
00:37:56,289 --> 00:37:59,935
You threw the first card, 
so let's hear it.

471
00:38:00,841 --> 00:38:05,882
Officially proclaim me as the
heir to Manbo Construction.

472
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:10,765
If you promise me
I will inherit this company,

473
00:38:10,939 --> 00:38:12,934
then I'll follow your wishes.

474
00:38:13,358 --> 00:38:17,535
Is that what they teach
you at school, these days?

475
00:38:17,759 --> 00:38:21,350
Think that everything should be 
given to you on a silver platter?

476
00:38:21,487 --> 00:38:23,732
I didn't come here to hear your lectures.

477
00:38:23,931 --> 00:38:26,164
Just make your decision.

478
00:38:26,613 --> 00:38:32,935
Prove your skills 
to everyone in this company.

479
00:38:33,122 --> 00:38:37,136
Then, I'll announce you as my heir.

480
00:38:38,354 --> 00:38:43,042
Without first proving yourself,
I'm not giving you a thing.

481
00:38:43,285 --> 00:38:44,376
Fine.

482
00:38:44,575 --> 00:38:50,685
You promised you will
do so if I prove myself.

483
00:38:53,941 --> 00:38:55,743
Jeongyeon.

484
00:38:57,663 --> 00:39:03,635
Do you covet this company that bad?

485
00:39:05,595 --> 00:39:08,632
I don't want to be
abandoned like my mother.

486
00:39:09,804 --> 00:39:14,330
She was kicked out
because she was powerless.

487
00:39:15,177 --> 00:39:23,137
If I ever leave, it'll be on my terms.
I'm never going to end up like her.

488
00:39:34,075 --> 00:39:36,521
That little...

489
00:39:40,685 --> 00:39:45,398
Yes, we completed our
report on the area already.

490
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:55,574
- Didn't I tell you already last week?
- Chief.

491
00:39:55,811 --> 00:39:57,552
Can I help you with anything?

492
00:39:57,681 --> 00:39:58,704
I'm fine.

493
00:39:58,866 --> 00:40:01,314
Seems like you didn't
understand what I told you,

494
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:04,308
<i>but just start acquiring
equipment and materials.</i>

495
00:40:05,492 --> 00:40:07,515
Should I bring you a cup of coffee?

496
00:40:07,665 --> 00:40:08,837
I'm good at making that.

497
00:40:08,974 --> 00:40:11,243
You want coffee?
Have a seat, I'll go get it.

498
00:40:11,343 --> 00:40:12,677
No...

499
00:40:13,114 --> 00:40:15,729
Never mind.

500
00:40:18,322 --> 00:40:19,818
Let me do that, I'm good at copying.

501
00:40:19,931 --> 00:40:22,624
There's no need, Agasshi, let me do it.

502
00:40:54,596 --> 00:40:56,728
Chief, please sign these.

503
00:41:00,315 --> 00:41:02,535
Is Hwang Jeongyeon managing well?

504
00:41:02,856 --> 00:41:05,739
We're busy enough as it is,
and she just seems to interfere...

505
00:41:05,926 --> 00:41:10,682
I think not entrusting her anything 
for the time being would be wiser.

506
00:41:13,478 --> 00:41:15,613
- You may go.
- Yes.

507
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:37,730
Everyone's gone home,
you still have work left to do?

508
00:41:37,855 --> 00:41:43,412
My superior is still here,
can a bottom feeder like me leave early?

509
00:41:49,301 --> 00:41:53,678
Isn't giving me no work
on purpose a little crude?

510
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:58,727
I can't entrust anything to
people who aren't prepared.

511
00:42:00,782 --> 00:42:02,636
This is all the data
regarding our upcoming bid.

512
00:42:02,798 --> 00:42:07,619
Start by studying these, and then
I'll decide what your duties will be.

513
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:47,443
He's so annoying, that Jo Minwoo...

514
00:42:49,799 --> 00:42:55,952
But he sure knows 
how to push your buttons.

515
00:42:56,931 --> 00:43:00,073
Fine, you just wait and see.

516
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:04,275
I'll wipe off that
pompous smirk off your face.

517
00:43:04,587 --> 00:43:07,105
You can bet on that.

518
00:43:08,697 --> 00:43:13,189
I'd prefer if you didn't
talk about Jo Minwoo with me.

519
00:43:14,586 --> 00:43:18,912
I know, that you dislike
him as much as I do.

520
00:43:19,523 --> 00:43:21,593
You're right, let's just stop.

521
00:43:21,767 --> 00:43:23,875
He's just going to ruin the mood.

522
00:43:24,299 --> 00:43:26,793
Ajumma, another bottle of soju.

523
00:43:26,947 --> 00:43:28,698
<i>Yes.</i>

524
00:43:30,896 --> 00:43:32,229
<i>Here...</i>

525
00:43:34,118 --> 00:43:37,449
Why aren't you drinking at all?

526
00:43:49,113 --> 00:43:51,251
<i>Awww... Bitter.</i>

527
00:43:51,426 --> 00:43:54,244
<i>It's so bitter...</i>

528
00:44:01,537 --> 00:44:04,031
Should I let you down now?

529
00:44:04,928 --> 00:44:06,675
No way.

530
00:44:07,037 --> 00:44:10,466
I'm so drunk I can't walk straight.

531
00:44:14,927 --> 00:44:17,049
Remember?

532
00:44:17,897 --> 00:44:24,867
When we were kids, 
the first time we met in Daejeon.

533
00:44:25,428 --> 00:44:28,446
You carried me on 
your back that day, too.

534
00:44:32,423 --> 00:44:34,713
Your back is so comfortable.

535
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,743
You don't know that, do you?

536
00:44:44,687 --> 00:44:48,439
I wish time could just stop right now.

537
00:44:49,873 --> 00:44:52,242
If you're tired, just sleep.

538
00:44:56,575 --> 00:44:58,389
Gangmo.

539
00:44:58,856 --> 00:45:01,083
Sleep.

540
00:45:01,976 --> 00:45:03,440
Lee Gangmo.

541
00:45:03,627 --> 00:45:06,407
Don't call me and just sleep.

542
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:12,741
Don't you ever abandon me.

543
00:45:16,453 --> 00:45:22,650
Don't abandon me like my mother did.

544
00:45:48,822 --> 00:45:52,811
Ma'am, it's time to head to the stage.

545
00:46:14,514 --> 00:46:18,516
It's the bid presentation
I'll show to the other members.

546
00:46:20,101 --> 00:46:24,909
So with this you'll keep
the other members at bay,

547
00:46:25,015 --> 00:46:28,212
and Daeryuk Construction
will end up winning the bid?

548
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,394
Yes, Director.

549
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:33,673
They're waiting for me next door.

550
00:46:33,835 --> 00:46:38,480
Jo Pilyeon is eyeing a political career.

551
00:46:39,258 --> 00:46:42,067
If Manbo Construction
fails to win this bid,

552
00:46:42,191 --> 00:46:44,922
I'm sure the shock
will be hard to cope with.

553
00:46:45,502 --> 00:46:49,697
You don't need to worry about
Jo Pilyeon or Hwang Taeseop now.

554
00:46:49,847 --> 00:46:53,230
These days, the KCIA seems
to have lost its charm.

555
00:46:53,404 --> 00:46:57,494
The Blue House's escorts 
treat us like dirt.

556
00:46:57,643 --> 00:46:59,077
I can understand.

557
00:46:59,351 --> 00:47:05,670
I'll make sure you become a
congressman at the next elections.

558
00:47:05,857 --> 00:47:11,679
So all you need to do is make
a few contacts among politicians.

559
00:47:12,876 --> 00:47:15,756
- Thank you, Chairman Hong.
- Yes.

560
00:47:19,006 --> 00:47:22,285
You must take good care of the director.

561
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:24,043
Yes, Chairman.

562
00:47:24,417 --> 00:47:28,008
Wait here, I'll bring you 
the good news later.

563
00:47:28,133 --> 00:47:30,078
All right.

564
00:47:32,257 --> 00:47:34,504
Have a seat.

565
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:43,120
You're cute.

566
00:47:43,257 --> 00:47:44,830
What's your name?

567
00:47:44,978 --> 00:47:46,404
Lola.

568
00:47:46,516 --> 00:47:50,202
Not what you use here,
the one your parents gave you.

569
00:47:53,082 --> 00:47:54,566
Gyeongja.

570
00:47:54,778 --> 00:47:56,736
Yeom Gyeongja.

571
00:48:03,192 --> 00:48:08,591
<i>{\a6}~ Bae Insook's "Like Everyone Else Would" ~
(Cover of Alain Barriere's Un Poete)</i>

572
00:48:03,192 --> 00:48:08,591
"Like everyone else would,"

573
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:13,216
"They come back to mind
when I cross the street."

574
00:48:14,164 --> 00:48:19,497
"The faces of yesteryear,
who whispered in my ears,"

575
00:48:19,777 --> 00:48:23,662
"Caressing the way like falling petals."

576
00:48:25,128 --> 00:48:35,426
"Like pouring rainwater, I'm drenched
by those precious memories,"

577
00:48:36,274 --> 00:48:41,747
"I turn back as nostalgia haunts me,"

578
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:46,718
"Past those rivers of tears."

579
00:48:58,199 --> 00:49:02,313
"Like everyone else would,"

580
00:49:03,909 --> 00:49:08,484
"A glance at the mirror and I recall,"

581
00:49:09,319 --> 00:49:18,625
"The streets and alleys
my childhood memories were made of."

582
00:49:20,670 --> 00:49:25,775
"The white dreams
which made my heart throb..."

583
00:49:25,962 --> 00:49:30,425
<i>"Suddenly vanish out of the blue."</i>

584
00:49:31,721 --> 00:49:37,044
"As sadness surrounds me, I look back,"

585
00:49:37,181 --> 00:49:41,239
"Past those rivers of tears."

586
00:49:41,682 --> 00:49:44,225
<i>What are you waiting for?</i>

587
00:49:48,103 --> 00:49:53,399
<i>There's no way a dead
woman could be alive.</i>

588
00:49:53,686 --> 00:49:58,212
But they sure look alike...

589
00:49:59,010 --> 00:50:03,748
"When I close my eyes,
they come back to mind."

590
00:50:04,445 --> 00:50:09,900
"Not the woes of breaking up,
but the very first moments we shared,"

591
00:50:10,037 --> 00:50:14,413
"Placid waves of warmth 
gently caressing me."

592
00:50:19,064 --> 00:50:22,595
Chairman Hwang, what brings you here?

593
00:50:25,850 --> 00:50:29,740
What are you doing here?

594
00:50:30,426 --> 00:50:32,783
I suppose you haven't heard the news.

595
00:50:32,970 --> 00:50:37,973
Starting today, I've become an official
member of the construction committee.

596
00:50:38,123 --> 00:50:40,579
What's that supposed to mean?

597
00:50:41,863 --> 00:50:43,497
Listen, Chairman Hwang.

598
00:50:43,821 --> 00:50:46,688
Think you can just 
barge in as you please?

599
00:50:52,571 --> 00:50:55,987
<i>Those are agreements approving
my entrance into the committee.</i>

600
00:50:56,099 --> 00:50:58,522
They're what?!

601
00:51:11,355 --> 00:51:14,466
How do you explain this?

602
00:51:14,666 --> 00:51:15,599
Uh?

603
00:51:15,736 --> 00:51:20,075
From what I hear, 
you enjoy playing mahjong here?!

604
00:51:20,965 --> 00:51:23,554
Let's use cards next time.

605
00:51:23,703 --> 00:51:27,419
Mahjong just gives me a headache.

606
00:51:27,618 --> 00:51:29,477
<i>Get out of my face.</i>

607
00:51:29,783 --> 00:51:31,646
I'm never going to allow you in!

608
00:51:31,784 --> 00:51:33,604
And who the hell are you?

609
00:51:33,828 --> 00:51:36,098
Can you decide that on your own?

610
00:51:36,597 --> 00:51:38,529
These three gentlemen...

611
00:51:38,753 --> 00:51:41,421
<i>already agreed to it.</i>

612
00:51:41,658 --> 00:51:43,776
<i>If you don't approve their decision, 
you can just leave,</i>

613
00:51:43,914 --> 00:51:47,704
or break up the committee altogether.

614
00:51:47,891 --> 00:51:52,008
Do as you wish!

615
00:51:53,651 --> 00:51:55,970
According to committee rules,

616
00:51:56,282 --> 00:52:02,138
those not present at our meetings 
give up all their voting rights.

617
00:52:03,734 --> 00:52:05,044
Chairman Hong.

618
00:52:05,305 --> 00:52:07,063
As you wish.

619
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:12,038
One mouth less to share the pie with.

620
00:52:15,454 --> 00:52:23,883
And with that, let's get this meeting
for the subway bidding rights started.

621
00:52:25,127 --> 00:52:29,279
I was going to propose
doing it via secret voting...

622
00:52:30,139 --> 00:52:34,316
<i>I'm sure there would be no objections?!</i>

623
00:53:28,990 --> 00:53:32,544
Who will take care of counting votes?

624
00:53:35,527 --> 00:53:39,368
Care to help me with that, 
Chairman Cheon?

625
00:53:44,991 --> 00:53:47,401
Manbo Construction.

626
00:53:51,534 --> 00:53:53,952
Daeryuk Construction.

627
00:53:58,478 --> 00:54:00,710
Daeryuk Construction.

628
00:54:02,437 --> 00:54:04,810
<i>Manbo Construction.</i>

629
00:54:07,367 --> 00:54:09,885
Manbo Construction.

630
00:54:15,781 --> 00:54:18,164
Manbo Construction.

631
00:54:19,535 --> 00:54:26,218
Accordingly, Manbo Construction 
will be entrusted the subway construction.

632
00:54:26,392 --> 00:54:28,400
<i>That is all.</i>

633
00:54:58,205 --> 00:55:01,516
All these are about open bids 
in the construction sector.

634
00:55:01,653 --> 00:55:03,560
<i>Is it going well?</i>

635
00:55:03,772 --> 00:55:04,720
Afraid not.

636
00:55:04,882 --> 00:55:06,241
I can't really get my head around it.

637
00:55:06,366 --> 00:55:09,670
We have an expert on the matter, though.

638
00:55:09,844 --> 00:55:12,134
<i>Should I introduce you to him?</i>

639
00:55:12,651 --> 00:55:14,603
I'd appreciate it.

640
00:55:45,524 --> 00:55:49,875
At last, Chairman Hwang won the 
subway bidding rights at the meeting.

641
00:55:50,050 --> 00:55:51,696
That's good to hear.

642
00:55:53,486 --> 00:55:55,867
<i>~ Demonstrations in Busan, Masan ~</i>

643
00:56:06,718 --> 00:56:09,843
The situation in Busan
and Masan is quite serious.

644
00:56:09,992 --> 00:56:13,925
<i>They need to get it over with 
before things escalate.</i>

645
00:56:17,759 --> 00:56:20,933
Until the construction is
officially assigned to Manbo,

646
00:56:21,058 --> 00:56:22,579
we must never let our guard down.

647
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:24,474
<i>Keep an eye on Min Honggi until then,</i>

648
00:56:24,611 --> 00:56:28,202
because if he makes a move,
you never know what might happen.

649
00:56:29,162 --> 00:56:30,459
I will.

650
00:56:30,846 --> 00:56:36,368
We will finally get the chance 
to leave this gloomy rat-hole,

651
00:56:36,517 --> 00:56:38,487
and finally enter the political arena.

652
00:56:38,637 --> 00:56:41,879
As hard as it might be to wait, 
endure it until then.

653
00:56:56,409 --> 00:56:59,040
Jo Pilyeon, Hwang Taeseop...

654
00:57:00,063 --> 00:57:03,328
It's not going to go as you plan.

655
00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:07,043
I'll never allow it.

656
00:57:17,324 --> 00:57:23,271
<i>So he gained control of
the committee in one strike?</i>

657
00:57:24,249 --> 00:57:29,376
<i>Seems like that Hwang Taeseop
is not your ordinary fella?</i>

658
00:57:31,271 --> 00:57:35,909
<i>~ Euiinmulyong. Yonginmuleui. ~
Baekpa</i>

659
00:57:37,149 --> 00:57:41,620
You said you had 
some kind of past together?

660
00:57:43,590 --> 00:57:48,872
Is he the only particular 
relationship my past was made of?!

661
00:57:49,421 --> 00:57:51,959
You experience 
many relationships in life,

662
00:57:52,139 --> 00:57:55,150
but the traces they leave
behind are always different.

663
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:01,666
Seems like it'll rain.

664
00:58:27,461 --> 00:58:30,970
It's cold, so don't touch it.

665
00:58:32,765 --> 00:58:37,578
To me, it's the warmest of them all.

666
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:44,010
I still don't understand.

667
00:58:45,020 --> 00:58:52,214
Why you gave such an opportunity
to someone as insignificant as me.

668
00:58:56,056 --> 00:58:58,973
Know what these characters stand for?

669
00:58:59,770 --> 00:59:03,599
<i>Euiinmulyong. Yonginmuleui.</i>

670
00:59:03,811 --> 00:59:07,787
If haunted by suspicion,
do not use that person.

671
00:59:07,974 --> 00:59:12,450
But if you already are,
don't ever bear suspicions.

672
00:59:13,377 --> 00:59:18,173
You're working for me,
so I will never suspect you.

673
00:59:18,397 --> 00:59:21,115
That's all you need to know.

674
00:59:21,921 --> 00:59:23,779
Yes.

675
00:59:29,464 --> 00:59:35,488
Chairman Hong will not so easily give up.

676
00:59:37,969 --> 00:59:42,253
A cloud of dust is about 
to assault those sand dunes.

677
00:59:48,026 --> 00:59:50,067
What is this?
Let's wake up!

678
00:59:50,179 --> 00:59:51,612
All right.

679
01:00:00,902 --> 01:00:03,594
Today was the day you
always go to 31 Building, right?

680
01:00:03,819 --> 01:00:05,639
Just let us handle this for today.

681
01:00:05,826 --> 01:00:07,447
Forget it.

682
01:00:07,621 --> 01:00:12,546
Hey... Miju and your brother could come!

683
01:00:12,837 --> 01:00:14,454
I gave up.

684
01:00:15,384 --> 01:00:17,865
Seeing as they never came all these years,

685
01:00:19,087 --> 01:00:21,107
I won't be able to find them this way.

686
01:00:25,390 --> 01:00:26,518
Are you ready?

687
01:00:26,630 --> 01:00:28,089
Yes.

688
01:00:30,173 --> 01:00:31,786
Will they be enough?

689
01:00:31,936 --> 01:00:34,492
The others are waiting outside.

690
01:00:35,266 --> 01:00:37,422
We're at war with Daeryuk Construction.

691
01:00:37,546 --> 01:00:41,860
We must gain control
of the subway lot at all cost.

692
01:00:42,724 --> 01:00:44,149
Spare no effort.

693
01:00:44,336 --> 01:00:45,820
Yes.

694
01:01:07,213 --> 01:01:09,931
<i>{\a6}*lit. grandmother,

Some rice cakes, please.

696
01:01:20,732 --> 01:01:22,070
It's good.

697
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:24,018
Waiting for someone here?

698
01:01:24,113 --> 01:01:25,611
Yes.

699
01:01:26,030 --> 01:01:27,020
Who?

700
01:01:27,170 --> 01:01:28,329
Your boyfriend?

701
01:01:28,504 --> 01:01:30,386
Yes, both of them.

702
01:01:30,548 --> 01:01:31,855
Both?!

703
01:01:33,566 --> 01:01:35,511
You have that many?

704
01:01:38,117 --> 01:01:40,282
Actually, I'm waiting for my brothers.

705
01:01:40,419 --> 01:01:43,063
We separated when we were kids.

706
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:49,733
This tastes great.

707
01:02:48,767 --> 01:02:50,388
Long time no see.

708
01:02:50,555 --> 01:02:51,822
It's me, Sotae.

709
01:02:51,970 --> 01:02:53,380
Park Sotae.

710
01:02:53,717 --> 01:02:56,857
The one who used to shine shoes 
with you in Myeongdong.

711
01:02:57,057 --> 01:02:58,716
I've heard you were released from prison.

712
01:02:58,878 --> 01:03:00,001
Really?

713
01:03:00,206 --> 01:03:01,976
You disappoint me.

714
01:03:02,140 --> 01:03:04,349
Not even a visit all this time...

715
01:03:07,790 --> 01:03:11,493
Take your boys and pull out 
of the neighborhood.

716
01:03:13,156 --> 01:03:14,972
Never been in the can, have you?

717
01:03:15,171 --> 01:03:18,227
<i>Think it's easy to find
a job with a conviction?</i>

718
01:03:18,426 --> 01:03:22,715
Thanks to Chairman Hong Gipyo
my title now is "chief."

719
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,265
Chief Park.

720
01:03:24,371 --> 01:03:26,805
Where else would I hear that?

721
01:03:26,967 --> 01:03:29,511
Then, let's make the rules clear.

722
01:03:30,072 --> 01:03:32,693
Those who lose will 
give up this place for good.

723
01:03:33,876 --> 01:03:35,224
Nah...

724
01:03:38,756 --> 01:03:40,710
Let's just do it my way.

725
01:03:41,795 --> 01:03:44,942
We fight to our deaths.

726
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:48,520
Fine with me.

727
01:04:13,085 --> 01:04:25,308
"Here comes the water cock,
quacking on the paddy field."

728
01:04:25,952 --> 01:04:37,659
"Here comes the cuckoo,
echoing in the forest."

729
01:04:38,482 --> 01:04:40,496
Wow... They fit just right.

730
01:04:40,671 --> 01:04:44,291
They're so pretty!
Thanks, Oppa.

731
01:04:45,159 --> 01:04:49,498
"When my Oppa will ride
to Seoul with his horse,"

732
01:04:49,698 --> 01:04:59,556
"He said he will bring me silken shoes."

733
01:06:06,808 --> 01:06:09,245
You said so yourself.

734
01:06:09,482 --> 01:06:11,477
Let's fight to our deaths.

735
01:06:11,614 --> 01:06:12,923
I sure did.

736
01:06:13,048 --> 01:06:15,180
I'm on the edge of a cliff already.

737
01:06:15,279 --> 01:06:19,595
This is the kind of life
that suits people like us.

738
01:06:19,782 --> 01:06:21,228
Come.

739
01:06:22,388 --> 01:06:24,595
Come get some!

740
01:06:36,379 --> 01:06:38,071
Run, you pricks!

741
01:06:38,233 --> 01:06:40,093
That way!

742
01:06:46,536 --> 01:06:48,269
How many times do I have to tell you?

743
01:06:48,369 --> 01:06:50,207
I didn't demonstrate.

744
01:06:50,312 --> 01:06:52,402
You were found with demonstrators.

745
01:06:52,558 --> 01:06:56,224
I was waiting outside 31 Building,
and they just arrested me.

746
01:06:56,348 --> 01:06:57,059
Shut it.

747
01:06:57,184 --> 01:06:58,892
Which college and year?

748
01:06:59,530 --> 01:07:01,273
The name of your school!

749
01:07:02,386 --> 01:07:04,827
I'm not a college student.

750
01:07:04,976 --> 01:07:07,111
Then, what are you?

751
01:07:09,263 --> 01:07:10,774
I...

752
01:07:13,348 --> 01:07:14,615
am a housemaid.

753
01:07:14,790 --> 01:07:16,062
Uh?!

754
01:07:16,398 --> 01:07:17,820
Housemaid.

755
01:07:18,019 --> 01:07:19,690
Housemaid?!

756
01:07:21,044 --> 01:07:23,281
The ones cooking,
doing the laundry and stuff?

757
01:07:23,468 --> 01:07:24,989
Yes.

758
01:07:26,676 --> 01:07:28,594
Are you telling the truth?

759
01:07:28,843 --> 01:07:32,633
Can't you call and find out?

760
01:07:39,478 --> 01:07:41,868
- Enough!
- Just go!

761
01:07:44,211 --> 01:07:46,194
You're hurting me!

762
01:07:51,968 --> 01:07:54,411
Yes, I understand.

763
01:07:56,113 --> 01:07:57,287
See?

764
01:07:57,387 --> 01:07:58,421
What did I tell you?

765
01:07:58,571 --> 01:08:01,900
Next time don't even pass
where they're demonstrating.

766
01:08:02,307 --> 01:08:03,895
Just go, go...

767
01:08:04,115 --> 01:08:06,314
Ahh, my shoes.

768
01:08:10,282 --> 01:08:11,035
Are these your sister's?

769
01:08:11,172 --> 01:08:12,631
No, they're mine.

770
01:08:12,755 --> 01:08:15,062
My brother bought them.

771
01:08:17,536 --> 01:08:20,099
They're really pretty, aren't they?

772
01:08:22,011 --> 01:08:24,156
