Episode 50

4
00:00:10,447 --> 00:00:11,836
Thank you for coming.

5
00:00:11,922 --> 00:00:14,501
- Congratulations.
- Yes, please go in.

6
00:00:21,436 --> 00:00:24,059
Thank you for coming,
President Lee Gangmo.

7
00:00:24,288 --> 00:00:27,957
I have high expectations
about tonight's party.

8
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:34,520
I'm sure you'll welcome me
even without an invite, Jeongyeon?

9
00:00:35,477 --> 00:00:37,172
It's been a long time.

10
00:00:37,288 --> 00:00:38,953
Isn't it a wonderful night?

11
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,322
I hear there were no
demonstrations in Seoul today?

12
00:00:42,419 --> 00:00:44,819
There have to be days like this.

13
00:00:45,885 --> 00:00:50,782
Since you organized it, I'm
expecting even more from this party.

14
00:00:51,945 --> 00:00:56,021
I'm sure it won't disappoint you.

15
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:08,280
Esteemed Federation of
Korean Industries members,

16
00:01:08,642 --> 00:01:12,349
and representatives of
the ruling and opposition parties.

17
00:01:12,789 --> 00:01:19,621
I think this gathering is particularly
meaningful, more so than ever before.

18
00:01:20,166 --> 00:01:26,221
We are only one year away from a
worldwide festival like the Seoul Olympics,

19
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:36,359
and it is to ensure this event's
success that we all gathered here tonight.

20
00:01:37,956 --> 00:01:43,022
Other than being a competition pitting
sportsmen of every country against each other,

21
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:46,345
the Olimpic Games are also a golden opportunity
for business and culture...

22
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:48,252
from all over the world to meet.

23
00:01:48,337 --> 00:01:51,371
There are too many unfamiliar
faces among the journalists.

24
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,751
Not to mention the event
personnel and bodyguards.

25
00:01:57,077 --> 00:02:03,995
Seeing as Jo Pilyeon joined us,
maybe he smelled something already?

26
00:02:10,308 --> 00:02:11,900
What is the matter?

27
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:15,335
What could possibly be going on, to
see ANSP agents all over the place?

28
00:02:15,453 --> 00:02:20,103
We have reason to believe that opposition
party members might be plotting something.

29
00:02:20,228 --> 00:02:23,882
You're talking about people
formally invited by the hosts.

30
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:26,780
We can finally get the entire
congress under the same roof,

31
00:02:26,906 --> 00:02:28,767
must you really spoil the mood this way?

32
00:02:28,909 --> 00:02:31,396
Listen well, Congressman.

33
00:02:31,631 --> 00:02:37,698
There might be a secret bipartisan
agreement on the constitutional amendment.

34
00:02:37,859 --> 00:02:40,350
What?!
A secret agreement?

35
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,510
And what ruling party
member would agree to that?

36
00:02:44,023 --> 00:02:48,548
I guess this will be a good opportunity
to find out who the traitors are.

37
00:02:48,647 --> 00:02:53,750
If what you say is right,
we can't let this slide.

38
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:57,109
They must all be captured.

39
00:03:05,488 --> 00:03:07,778
The second part of
the event will soon start.

40
00:03:07,886 --> 00:03:10,527
Keep a close eye on all congress members.

41
00:03:10,613 --> 00:03:14,582
Check every single one they
meet, even if apparently accidental.

42
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:16,141
Don't worry.

43
00:03:16,254 --> 00:03:19,601
We not only have agents
on the field, but CCTV cameras as well.

44
00:03:20,321 --> 00:03:24,163
But shouldn't you
release Lee Seongmo by now?

45
00:03:24,262 --> 00:03:25,779
It's way too early to jump to conclusions.

46
00:03:25,878 --> 00:03:29,436
Why, don't you know that this
operation already leaked to the outside?

47
00:03:29,564 --> 00:03:31,506
It can't be Lee Seongmo.

48
00:03:31,633 --> 00:03:36,206
If any secret bipartisan
gathering happens tonight,

49
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,544
it could also mean it was
planned from the very start.

50
00:03:38,686 --> 00:03:43,052
And Lee Seongmo
might be part of this complot.

51
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,645
We must catch them by the end of the night.

52
00:03:47,758 --> 00:03:49,585
Is that clear, Chief Oh?

53
00:03:49,655 --> 00:03:53,965
Do it right, will you? What if
this falls down during the event?

54
00:03:54,036 --> 00:03:55,878
Stay put!

55
00:03:56,034 --> 00:03:57,721
Let me see.

56
00:03:58,612 --> 00:03:59,493
That should do it.

57
00:03:59,607 --> 00:04:03,271
So how do I look? Don't I look
at least ten years younger?

58
00:04:03,384 --> 00:04:04,845
Wake up, will you?

59
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:08,800
If anything goes wrong, you could
croak twenty years before your time.

60
00:04:08,899 --> 00:04:11,025
Like I wouldn't know that?

61
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:14,739
Look what I have to do for a living...

62
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:18,382
If only Jo Pilyeon couldn't
recognize me, I would have done it.

63
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,724
Hurry up and come out.
The second part is starting.

64
00:04:20,809 --> 00:04:22,648
Ahh... What the hell...

65
00:04:22,978 --> 00:04:26,875
Your pants... Eww...
You pissed all over them.

66
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:33,638
You must remember these faces.

67
00:04:33,837 --> 00:04:36,780
They're the people
you will give your red roses to.

68
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:40,232
Miju, come out.
It's your turn.

69
00:04:50,552 --> 00:04:53,395
Here... Let's change the mood.

70
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:58,121
Our first act of part two is a new
shining star causing a stir in the pop scene.

71
00:04:58,263 --> 00:05:00,261
Here is Cha Soojeong.

72
00:05:00,417 --> 00:05:03,877
Miss Cha, please.

73
00:05:08,209 --> 00:05:17,925
You smell like the
scent of sweet flowers,

74
00:05:18,316 --> 00:05:26,467
Waking me up from this deep sleep.

75
00:05:28,468 --> 00:05:37,767
Like a thorn blooming
into a fresh new petal,

76
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:47,244
You might resemble a rose.

77
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:57,782
Your face glitters like a rose,

78
00:05:58,023 --> 00:06:03,034
So when I call your name.

79
00:06:03,133 --> 00:06:09,250
When I call your name,

80
00:06:09,448 --> 00:06:16,824
I will say Rose.

81
00:06:46,495 --> 00:06:51,848
You will see the singer we invited
give red roses to certain ruling party members.

82
00:06:53,031 --> 00:06:57,088
They are those who would approve
a constitutional amendment.

83
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:53,893
- Lee Juil, along with Shim Hyungrae, Korea's
1980s "King of Comedy" -

84
00:08:03,196 --> 00:08:06,042
Guys, just sit and have a drink.

85
00:08:06,151 --> 00:08:08,087
We're fine.

86
00:08:09,245 --> 00:08:13,502
Why, afraid I'll knock
you down and run away?

87
00:08:24,151 --> 00:08:26,807
Please, don't let them catch you, Gangmo.

88
00:08:26,991 --> 00:08:28,962
I beg you...

89
00:08:37,696 --> 00:08:39,861
It was truly an impressive performance.

90
00:08:39,946 --> 00:08:43,546
Thanks to you, I can
finally see some sparks in the air.

91
00:08:43,646 --> 00:08:45,233
Thank you, Congressman Oh.

92
00:08:45,318 --> 00:08:47,190
So I was thinking.

93
00:08:47,447 --> 00:08:52,424
I'd like to recommend Miss Cha as
honorary ambassador for the city of Seoul.

94
00:08:52,807 --> 00:08:54,690
You really mean that, Deputy?

95
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:56,152
You won't disappoint us, right?

96
00:08:56,308 --> 00:08:59,327
It would be a great honor.

97
00:08:59,696 --> 00:09:04,260
Soojeong, you better thank
the deputy mayor with a big bow.

98
00:09:04,572 --> 00:09:07,317
So let's make a toast.

99
00:09:12,172 --> 00:09:16,532
The financial world is keeping a close
eye on Hangang Construction these days.

100
00:09:16,674 --> 00:09:18,106
I appreciate it.

101
00:09:18,332 --> 00:09:21,394
I hope I can count on
your continued support.

102
00:09:21,536 --> 00:09:22,542
Right...

103
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:26,639
I hear you have a keen interest
in the credit sector, Director Hwang?

104
00:09:26,753 --> 00:09:30,126
Yes, we plan to start our
own credit institution very soon.

105
00:09:30,226 --> 00:09:32,267
Retaining your clientele
must be the key here.

106
00:09:32,366 --> 00:09:37,991
You will get preferential treatment
if you decide to join it.

107
00:09:38,567 --> 00:09:42,829
I see Miss Hwang takes after her father.

108
00:09:43,114 --> 00:09:45,792
I know that only simpletons
would brag about their kids,

109
00:09:45,896 --> 00:09:50,357
but my Jeongyeon
leaves nothing to be desired.

110
00:09:50,527 --> 00:09:53,546
But, did you get married?

111
00:09:53,701 --> 00:09:57,584
Why, are you interested
in some matchmaking?

112
00:09:57,711 --> 00:10:01,540
My second son is still single.

113
00:10:01,937 --> 00:10:06,261
I see there was another reason
why you came here, Chairman Kim.

114
00:10:19,104 --> 00:10:25,641
I suggest you keep Min Honggi
and his surroundings in check.

115
00:10:25,826 --> 00:10:27,810
All right.

116
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:37,818
Did you tell the opposition party members
that you'd show them the account?

117
00:10:37,931 --> 00:10:41,949
Otherwise, they'll never trust us.

118
00:10:42,034 --> 00:10:46,315
And how are you going to
do that in this atmosphere?

119
00:10:47,349 --> 00:10:49,532
Let's wait.

120
00:10:59,777 --> 00:11:02,382
Is there anything else I
can bring you, gentlemen?

121
00:11:03,289 --> 00:11:08,324
To verify the account, call the
waiter and order some beverages.

122
00:11:09,299 --> 00:11:10,958
Can I have the menu?

123
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:12,489
Yes.

124
00:11:15,478 --> 00:11:19,481
Here you go, Sir.

125
00:11:22,878 --> 00:11:24,267
Yes.

126
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:27,088
Here as well.

127
00:11:42,864 --> 00:11:45,452
One more glass of this, please.

128
00:11:45,545 --> 00:11:46,783
Yes.

129
00:11:46,925 --> 00:11:47,818
Will you take a look as well?

130
00:11:47,917 --> 00:11:50,766
Yes, let's do that.

131
00:11:57,798 --> 00:12:00,758
Bring me the same.

132
00:12:21,352 --> 00:12:23,393
Have you enjoyed your dinner?

133
00:12:23,606 --> 00:12:26,271
The steak here is delicious.

134
00:12:29,528 --> 00:12:33,780
They have been shown the account.

135
00:12:35,334 --> 00:12:37,439
All right.

136
00:12:42,953 --> 00:12:44,203
What's going on?

137
00:12:44,315 --> 00:12:46,256
Nothing is happening.

138
00:12:46,469 --> 00:12:49,879
The party is not over yet.

139
00:12:57,165 --> 00:13:00,948
Min Honggi is approaching Congressman Jang.

140
00:13:08,683 --> 00:13:12,792
I wonder what convinced you to leave
your precious street demonstrations for a day?!

141
00:13:12,962 --> 00:13:15,769
Are we in the mood for
sarcasm, by any chance?!

142
00:13:15,911 --> 00:13:18,888
Don't you think that instigating
people to demonstrate on the streets...

143
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,452
is beneath a politician worth his name?

144
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:25,307
What's more democratic, demonstrating
on the street for the sake of one's country,

145
00:13:25,463 --> 00:13:27,731
or ignoring this sad state of things because
it's beneath you, like some politicians I know?

146
00:13:27,816 --> 00:13:30,070
Democratic?!

147
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:33,982
Is throwing rocks and Molotovs at
the authorities democratic behavior?

148
00:13:34,157 --> 00:13:38,658
Have you people ever stopped a moment
to consider what the people really wish for?

149
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:40,784
How else are they going to resist
the oppression of authorities...

150
00:13:40,912 --> 00:13:42,669
who let rifles and batons
speak on their behalf?

151
00:13:42,754 --> 00:13:44,370
Look, Congressman Jang...
Watch what you say!

152
00:13:44,441 --> 00:13:47,975
Right as we speak, our people
are shedding blood on the streets...

153
00:13:48,089 --> 00:13:50,849
to finally turn the tides of
this wretched reality of ours!

154
00:13:51,033 --> 00:13:55,179
And all you worry about is winning
favors with those in power...

155
00:13:55,647 --> 00:13:57,376
You should be ashamed of yourselves.

156
00:13:57,447 --> 00:14:00,892
Hey! Shut that insolent mouth of yours!

157
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,491
What's wrong with
you people? Give it a rest!

158
00:14:10,562 --> 00:14:12,674
So what, we're basking in a
cesspool and you're completely clean?

159
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:15,850
You're the only reason
why people are reacting this way!

160
00:14:15,935 --> 00:14:18,458
Stop it, Congressman Min!
There are journalists here.

161
00:14:18,529 --> 00:14:20,953
Enough with this, and follow me!

162
00:14:21,052 --> 00:14:23,794
Ehh.... How embarrassing!

163
00:14:35,086 --> 00:14:37,367
Here... Folks.

164
00:14:39,122 --> 00:14:42,963
Here... Here.

165
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,373
We all gathered here today to show unity.

166
00:14:45,472 --> 00:14:47,287
Even if you argue, don't do it here.

167
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,019
There are journalists all over
the place, so let's reconcile.

168
00:14:50,126 --> 00:14:51,454
Go ahead.

169
00:14:51,554 --> 00:14:56,613
Ohh Ohh... Come on.
Shake hands.

170
00:15:00,158 --> 00:15:02,822
Here! Let's leave them alone.

171
00:15:03,894 --> 00:15:06,840
What is going on?
Did you reconcile?

172
00:15:09,626 --> 00:15:12,142
Here... Everyone, you saw that, right?

173
00:15:12,255 --> 00:15:16,352
They reconciled, so no need
to write anything about this.

174
00:15:24,418 --> 00:15:26,905
Have you seen the account?

175
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:29,524
Yes, we verified it.

176
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:31,891
I'll take care of securing enough ruling
party members to enact the amendment...

177
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:35,392
by the next plenary session.

178
00:15:35,563 --> 00:15:39,376
Let's give it our all and
fight for our people together.

179
00:15:39,886 --> 00:15:42,150
Let's do it.

180
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:02,930
That's our signal that
they've made it, Gangmo.

181
00:16:16,931 --> 00:16:18,799
What did I say?

182
00:16:18,912 --> 00:16:21,676
I told you not to act so impulsively.

183
00:16:21,776 --> 00:16:24,582
Have you forgotten
whom we're dealing with?

184
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:39,217
Congressman.

185
00:16:39,401 --> 00:16:40,833
Are you leaving?

186
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,583
Did the secret agreement go well?

187
00:16:43,782 --> 00:16:45,495
Excuse me?

188
00:16:47,071 --> 00:16:48,520
My guess was right.

189
00:16:48,648 --> 00:16:53,155
Pushing you behind closed
doors was the right thing to do.

190
00:16:53,524 --> 00:16:55,452
Thank you, Sir.

191
00:16:55,707 --> 00:16:57,819
It wouldn't have been
possible without your help.

192
00:16:57,918 --> 00:17:01,122
Ahh... I wasn't looking
for acknowledgments.

193
00:17:01,292 --> 00:17:06,817
It's just that you remind
me of when I first entered politics.

194
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:09,213
Ohh... Here's my car.

195
00:17:09,425 --> 00:17:11,920
I'll have to get going.

196
00:17:14,765 --> 00:17:18,725
Don't you forget that spirit.

197
00:17:18,867 --> 00:17:21,815
Don't let politics spoil it like with me.

198
00:17:52,184 --> 00:17:55,729
The event just concluded.

199
00:18:01,756 --> 00:18:04,247
What embarrassment did you get us into?

200
00:18:04,386 --> 00:18:06,549
First we capture Lee Seongmo
without a shred of evidence,

201
00:18:06,634 --> 00:18:10,177
then we get stared at by everyone
for ruining the mood here.

202
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:11,980
What goddamned embarrassment is this?

203
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:13,497
You more than deserve it.

204
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,581
Since that is all you could do.

205
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,931
What?

206
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,166
You still refuse to admit
any mistake on your part?

207
00:18:19,259 --> 00:18:21,360
My judgment was flawless.

208
00:18:21,454 --> 00:18:23,281
You were just too incompetent
to get a hold of all this ruse.

209
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,478
Hey... Jo Pilyeon!

210
00:18:25,869 --> 00:18:27,914
Careful what you say, Chief Oh.

211
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:30,964
Don't delude yourself into
thinking you can talk to me like that.

212
00:18:32,561 --> 00:18:36,562
I'll take Lee Seongmo.
Just release him.

213
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:38,247
Fine.

214
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:40,856
Do as you damn please!

215
00:19:15,686 --> 00:19:17,757
It's Seongmo Oppa.

216
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:58,852
Big Oppa...

217
00:19:58,965 --> 00:20:00,921
will be all right now, I hope?

218
00:20:01,106 --> 00:20:03,501
They're releasing him because
he's no longer being suspected.

219
00:20:03,572 --> 00:20:04,862
Right, Little Oppa?

220
00:20:04,961 --> 00:20:06,450
Let's go wait at the apartment.

221
00:20:06,521 --> 00:20:09,554
Not there, Oppa.

222
00:20:10,135 --> 00:20:14,160
Minwoo knows where I live.

223
00:20:14,855 --> 00:20:19,759
If he learns Seongmo is my brother,
it could put him in danger.

224
00:20:30,955 --> 00:20:33,341
Did you catch the culprit?

225
00:20:33,922 --> 00:20:35,340
Nah.

226
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:37,551
We couldn't.

227
00:20:38,147 --> 00:20:43,965
Have you seen that account personally?

228
00:20:44,515 --> 00:20:46,386
I haven't.

229
00:20:46,742 --> 00:20:48,881
Who saw it?

230
00:20:51,371 --> 00:20:55,331
All I needed was the confirmation
that you weren't the culprit.

231
00:20:55,473 --> 00:20:57,599
That's good enough for me.

232
00:20:57,698 --> 00:20:59,752
But not for me.

233
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:05,113
I must find who did this to me.

234
00:21:05,978 --> 00:21:07,338
Seongmo.

235
00:21:07,565 --> 00:21:11,436
Enduring injustice is part of life.

236
00:21:11,556 --> 00:21:15,234
If you let that affect you
every time, you will find no peace.

237
00:21:15,418 --> 00:21:18,935
Except for the fact that you would
never let any such injustice slide,

238
00:21:19,161 --> 00:21:21,799
if you were on the receiving end of it.

239
00:21:22,376 --> 00:21:26,548
You still resent me?

240
00:21:26,902 --> 00:21:28,844
If I say I do,

241
00:21:29,373 --> 00:21:31,849
will you accept that?

242
00:21:33,266 --> 00:21:34,826
Seongmo.

243
00:21:35,302 --> 00:21:38,894
The congressman invited
you here to console you.

244
00:21:39,563 --> 00:21:41,488
I'll have to get going.

245
00:21:42,651 --> 00:21:46,166
I guess time might console me a lot better.

246
00:22:00,627 --> 00:22:01,761
Try to understand him.

247
00:22:01,888 --> 00:22:05,186
I'm sure all this really shocked him.

248
00:22:05,313 --> 00:22:07,950
I still have doubts about this all.

249
00:22:08,418 --> 00:22:12,429
I'm sure there's more than one culprit.

250
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:14,329
Are you suggesting
there was an accomplice?

251
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:17,419
The account was obviously
written by one man alone.

252
00:22:17,575 --> 00:22:20,278
But there must be someone
backing him from behind the scenes.

253
00:22:20,392 --> 00:22:23,458
So you're still suspecting Seongmo...

254
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:26,856
In my mind, nothing has changed.

255
00:22:28,004 --> 00:22:34,833
Because there are only two people
who could have written that account.

256
00:22:39,885 --> 00:22:41,463
Me and...

257
00:22:42,942 --> 00:22:44,965
Lee Seongmo.

258
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,329
Chief.

259
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:58,115
Chanseong.

260
00:22:59,212 --> 00:23:01,389
It was hard, wasn't it?

261
00:23:07,224 --> 00:23:09,544
Thanks for everything you did.

262
00:23:13,102 --> 00:23:15,554
Your siblings are waiting for you.

263
00:23:35,949 --> 00:23:37,162
Miju.

264
00:23:37,772 --> 00:23:39,607
Gangmo.

265
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:44,668
Big Oppa...

266
00:23:47,336 --> 00:23:49,856
Oppa, are you okay?

267
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:51,671
I'm fine.

268
00:23:51,917 --> 00:23:53,622
Oppa is all right.

269
00:23:53,778 --> 00:23:56,173
Look at your face...

270
00:23:56,429 --> 00:23:58,512
It must have been so hard...

271
00:23:58,626 --> 00:24:00,780
I said it's all right.

272
00:24:01,957 --> 00:24:04,494
Come on, it's getting awkward...

273
00:24:06,224 --> 00:24:07,925
Hyung.

274
00:24:11,778 --> 00:24:13,371
Gangmo.

275
00:24:22,775 --> 00:24:24,782
Thanks, Gangmo.

276
00:24:25,689 --> 00:24:28,250
Chanseong told me.

277
00:24:31,621 --> 00:24:33,849
You did great.

278
00:24:34,226 --> 00:24:36,089
I owe you my life.

279
00:24:37,361 --> 00:24:40,866
Next time, discuss it with me before
you do something like this.

280
00:24:41,036 --> 00:24:42,836
Don't try to do it all alone.

281
00:24:43,843 --> 00:24:48,832
I've suddenly become
the pest of the family...

282
00:24:49,927 --> 00:24:53,936
I'm sorry,
Big Oppa, Little Oppa.

283
00:24:54,519 --> 00:25:00,083
I finally realized how hard it's
been for the both of you.

284
00:25:00,447 --> 00:25:04,176
I will never make you worry again.

285
00:25:05,568 --> 00:25:06,920
See?

286
00:25:07,027 --> 00:25:10,672
Thanks to you, even Miju has matured.

287
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:12,132
All right.

288
00:25:12,259 --> 00:25:15,834
Fine... I won't make you worry again.

289
00:25:26,392 --> 00:25:27,246
Oppa!

290
00:25:27,373 --> 00:25:30,040
You're out there, right?

291
00:25:30,252 --> 00:25:32,946
We're not going anywhere, stop worrying.

292
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:35,724
Take your time, Miju.
It's all right.

293
00:25:37,403 --> 00:25:41,564
She still can't go to the
lady's room alone, can she?!

294
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:43,520
Gangmo.

295
00:25:44,002 --> 00:25:48,149
Give that account back to me.

296
00:25:48,697 --> 00:25:50,712
It's dangerous.

297
00:25:51,052 --> 00:25:54,234
If things go wrong,
you might even lose your life.

298
00:25:54,357 --> 00:25:59,189
I don't believe that Jo
Pilyeon no longer suspects you.

299
00:26:00,422 --> 00:26:02,156
I will keep it.

300
00:26:02,579 --> 00:26:06,576
- Gangmo.
- Just this once, do as I say.

301
00:26:07,432 --> 00:26:11,155
When you need it, I'll give it to you.

302
00:26:14,628 --> 00:26:16,482
By the way,

303
00:26:17,602 --> 00:26:21,288
because of me you couldn't
focus on your boiler project, what now?

304
00:26:21,727 --> 00:26:24,151
If you let Jo Minwoo beat you,

305
00:26:24,704 --> 00:26:26,845
it'll also influence the New City concessions.

306
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:28,262
It's all right, Hyung.

307
00:26:28,432 --> 00:26:30,388
The sale hasn't even started.

308
00:26:30,502 --> 00:26:32,946
Is there anything I can help you with?

309
00:26:35,386 --> 00:26:37,525
I'll help you, Oppa.

310
00:26:38,146 --> 00:26:40,289
And how would you help him?

311
00:26:40,501 --> 00:26:42,826
You're talking to a
very expensive model here.

312
00:26:42,982 --> 00:26:45,809
I'll be the model for Hangang
Construction's apartments.

313
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:50,577
That sounds cool?
"The apartment Cha Soojeong lives in."

314
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:51,975
He'd hit the jackpot?!

315
00:26:52,074 --> 00:26:53,123
Fine, Miju.

316
00:26:53,223 --> 00:26:55,150
We'll pay you generously.

317
00:26:55,278 --> 00:26:57,101
And how would that help you?

318
00:26:57,225 --> 00:27:00,112
You've given me an
apartment, so I'll do it for free.

319
00:27:00,211 --> 00:27:03,595
Hey... Still, how can I
ask my own sister to...

320
00:27:03,665 --> 00:27:05,789
No discussions.

321
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:07,819
I want to help you.

322
00:27:07,932 --> 00:27:10,186
No way, Lee Miju.

323
00:27:10,453 --> 00:27:14,013
Hey... Don't start arguing.
Let's just do this.

324
00:27:14,198 --> 00:27:16,367
You'll do it for free,

325
00:27:16,494 --> 00:27:19,868
and if you hit the jackpot, you'll
move her to a much nicer apartment.

326
00:27:19,953 --> 00:27:22,641
- Happy now?
- Sounds good, Big Oppa.

327
00:27:26,069 --> 00:27:29,720
So should the water reach boiling point,

328
00:27:29,847 --> 00:27:31,350
it would increase volume?

329
00:27:31,506 --> 00:27:34,212
Ahh... You ignoramus.
Don't even know that?

330
00:27:34,297 --> 00:27:35,772
What....
Ignoramus?

331
00:27:35,899 --> 00:27:38,753
I always worked at the construction
site, how would I know?

332
00:27:38,848 --> 00:27:40,081
Listen well, Brother-in-law.

333
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,990
The issue here...

334
00:27:42,097 --> 00:27:44,771
is that if the water reaches
boiling point, it'll increase its volume...

335
00:27:44,874 --> 00:27:48,123
and leak into the
layers linking all the pipes.

336
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:52,781
Aigoo... And I thought all you did
all day was looking awry...

337
00:27:52,908 --> 00:27:55,488
We've become a boiler expert, already!

338
00:27:56,112 --> 00:28:00,237
So... How would you solve that?

339
00:28:00,861 --> 00:28:01,980
Who...

340
00:28:02,632 --> 00:28:04,504
Me?!

341
00:28:09,137 --> 00:28:10,527
So what I was saying is...

342
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,284
The water would start leaking, right?

343
00:28:12,355 --> 00:28:15,593
- Just like this.
- Yeah, leak.

344
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,054
Ahh... I can't take it anymore.
Take off that damn wig!

345
00:28:18,139 --> 00:28:19,457
Ahh... Really.

346
00:28:19,542 --> 00:28:23,527
I'm the one throwing a blanket over
the scalp, and you're the one complaining?

347
00:28:23,669 --> 00:28:25,441
Allow me to explain.

348
00:28:25,568 --> 00:28:31,664
All we need to do is create a space
which would house this increased volume,

349
00:28:31,976 --> 00:28:36,384
and we're testing out what
the appropriate size should be.

350
00:28:36,526 --> 00:28:39,366
I think water is boiling?

351
00:28:51,819 --> 00:28:56,069
What's this... We failed again?

352
00:28:58,196 --> 00:29:03,540
Why the hell did you take it off?
I can't even look at that scalp.

353
00:29:03,752 --> 00:29:07,481
What are you, fueling the fire?

354
00:29:07,566 --> 00:29:12,239
I can't bear to watch it, so just cover it!

355
00:29:15,698 --> 00:29:16,959
Let me pour you a drink.

356
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:18,972
Nah, forget it.

357
00:29:19,398 --> 00:29:21,111
Why let that disappoint you?

358
00:29:21,198 --> 00:29:22,729
It's not like we don't
know how to solve this.

359
00:29:22,842 --> 00:29:24,592
I'm not in the mood,

360
00:29:24,685 --> 00:29:28,453
and if we want to match
the start of the sale,

361
00:29:28,652 --> 00:29:30,255
we don't have the time, either.

362
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:32,621
Ahh... Why are you acting like this?

363
00:29:32,749 --> 00:29:37,585
I know you've been spending
sleepless nights working there.

364
00:29:37,866 --> 00:29:40,719
So have a drink and a good night of sleep.

365
00:29:40,832 --> 00:29:44,574
Why, if we sleep, is anyone
going to solve our problems?

366
00:29:44,669 --> 00:29:45,791
Right.

367
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:49,905
We need to solve this whatever it takes.

368
00:29:50,032 --> 00:29:53,576
You don't always have to
use technology to solve such problems.

369
00:29:53,689 --> 00:29:54,880
What's that supposed to mean?

370
00:29:55,008 --> 00:29:59,954
Why, what are you going to do,
call a mudang and have a ritual instead?

371
00:30:00,068 --> 00:30:03,767
When technology doesn't work,
you need people to solve your problems.

372
00:30:03,838 --> 00:30:05,213
Is he drunk?!

373
00:30:05,327 --> 00:30:07,609
Aren't technicians people, too?

374
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:11,479
I've had it with all this,
just serve me a drink.

375
00:30:11,663 --> 00:30:13,320
Here you go.

376
00:30:13,434 --> 00:30:16,524
Let's make a toast and cheer up.

377
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,991
President, it's really been a long time.

378
00:30:19,132 --> 00:30:20,805
This is on the house.

379
00:30:20,918 --> 00:30:21,726
Thank you.

380
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,626
Ohh... On the house!

381
00:30:23,725 --> 00:30:25,898
Told you Auntie's the best!

382
00:30:25,977 --> 00:30:28,345
That's why I always come here.

383
00:30:28,439 --> 00:30:33,513
- So, what, is she your real aunt?
- Aren't we all the same anyhow... Here!

384
00:30:38,817 --> 00:30:41,824
You don't always have to
use technology to solve such problems.

385
00:30:41,937 --> 00:30:43,065
What's that supposed to mean?

386
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:47,508
Why, what are you going to do,
call a mudang and have a ritual instead?

387
00:30:47,602 --> 00:30:50,364
When technology doesn't work,
you need people to solve your problems.

388
00:30:50,449 --> 00:30:51,727
Is he drunk?

389
00:30:51,793 --> 00:30:54,941
Aren't technicians people, too?

390
00:30:55,101 --> 00:31:00,361
Don't come here again.

391
00:31:01,104 --> 00:31:06,065
Pretend we don't know each other,

392
00:31:07,353 --> 00:31:11,655
and don't ever show up before me again.

393
00:31:14,961 --> 00:31:18,124
So you're saying that you don't
care even if this will kill me.

394
00:31:21,187 --> 00:31:22,988
I'm sorry.

395
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:26,441
Chairman?

396
00:31:36,984 --> 00:31:41,393
Seems like President Lee is
developing a similar technology.

397
00:31:41,489 --> 00:31:47,352
What we can rely on is the fact that
we're still one step ahead of him.

398
00:31:48,503 --> 00:31:52,720
How far has development proceeded?

399
00:31:52,859 --> 00:31:57,069
Other than the toxic gas exhaust
mechanism, everything is complete.

400
00:31:57,556 --> 00:31:59,586
Start by securing a patent for it.

401
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:03,552
That will help us tremendously.

402
00:32:03,752 --> 00:32:05,255
All right.

403
00:32:05,764 --> 00:32:11,081
Lee Gangmo's side will try everything in
their power to steal our technology.

404
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,608
So maintain tight security.

405
00:32:12,749 --> 00:32:14,400
Yes, Chairman.

406
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:18,934
But, about that factory manager from Beaute.

407
00:32:19,169 --> 00:32:22,258
How about we give him a
position at the research lab?

408
00:32:23,421 --> 00:32:28,464
Considering his reputation in the
boiler sector, he could certainly help us.

409
00:32:28,953 --> 00:32:30,543
I'll leave that to you.

410
00:32:30,708 --> 00:32:32,106
Yes, Chairman.

411
00:32:51,033 --> 00:32:52,149
What?

412
00:32:52,353 --> 00:32:54,326
They've already paid the rest of the bills?!

413
00:32:54,443 --> 00:32:54,925
Yes...

414
00:32:54,984 --> 00:32:59,189
While you were away this
morning, they settled it all.

415
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:04,698
You said his name was Moon
Seongjoong of Manbo Construction?

416
00:33:05,648 --> 00:33:07,898
It's probably him.

417
00:33:11,492 --> 00:33:12,819
Yes?

418
00:33:13,571 --> 00:33:15,744
Ahh... Yes! Director Moon.

419
00:33:16,613 --> 00:33:18,540
What? The research lab?

420
00:33:18,657 --> 00:33:20,067
Until the factory is complete,

421
00:33:20,137 --> 00:33:23,382
you'll focus on boiler
development at the research lab.

422
00:33:23,494 --> 00:33:24,667
Thank you.

423
00:33:24,786 --> 00:33:26,621
Thank you very much, Director Moon.

424
00:33:26,821 --> 00:33:30,544
You can rest this weekend,
and start working on Monday.

425
00:33:30,779 --> 00:33:32,720
All right.

426
00:33:33,366 --> 00:33:35,520
Director Moon.

427
00:33:35,658 --> 00:33:40,519
I'll never forget the help you gave
us, paying all those hospital bills.

428
00:33:41,153 --> 00:33:42,698
Hospital... bills?!

429
00:33:42,946 --> 00:33:46,814
Weren't you the one who paid those bills?

430
00:33:46,956 --> 00:33:49,502
I guess you got confused.

431
00:33:49,654 --> 00:33:51,874
I never did such thing.

432
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:06,068
What else do you want?

433
00:34:06,553 --> 00:34:08,464
I guess he's being discharged?

434
00:34:10,068 --> 00:34:11,691
Ajeosshi!

435
00:34:11,795 --> 00:34:14,800
Minsu!

436
00:34:16,562 --> 00:34:17,725
So you're fully recovered?

437
00:34:17,807 --> 00:34:19,205
Yes, I'm fine now.

438
00:34:19,299 --> 00:34:20,579
Great.

439
00:34:22,047 --> 00:34:23,310
You've come.

440
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:25,210
It's a relief Minsu recovered so well.

441
00:34:25,335 --> 00:34:28,999
It's all thanks to you, Director Moon.
Thank you so much.

442
00:34:40,642 --> 00:34:44,350
I really can't figure him out.

443
00:34:44,533 --> 00:34:47,376
Why even help someone who knows no shame?

444
00:34:47,505 --> 00:34:50,465
Go to the Samcheong camp
and you'll get your answer.

445
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:53,241
What the hell is
that supposed to mean?

446
00:34:53,546 --> 00:34:55,508
Oh, it does mean something.

447
00:34:55,848 --> 00:35:00,007
Something powerful enough to
force you to look at the mirror.

448
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:05,003
Didn't that make
a decent man out of me?

449
00:35:08,987 --> 00:35:13,450
I stole Beaute's core technology.

450
00:35:13,554 --> 00:35:15,082
I know.

451
00:35:15,317 --> 00:35:19,317
And I sold it to Manbo Construction.

452
00:35:19,481 --> 00:35:21,607
I'm sure you did.

453
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:29,054
I will soon start working at their research lab.

454
00:35:29,583 --> 00:35:31,366
Good for you.

455
00:35:32,482 --> 00:35:35,571
Why did you help someone like me?

456
00:35:35,822 --> 00:35:38,038
I have no excuses.

457
00:35:38,367 --> 00:35:40,605
I'm nothing but a shameless traitor.

458
00:35:42,583 --> 00:35:47,550
After losing traces of
each other in our childhood,

459
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,922
I just met my family again.

460
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:54,703
If I were in your shoes,

461
00:35:55,032 --> 00:36:01,006
and anyone in my family was hurting
and in need, I would have done the same.

462
00:36:02,262 --> 00:36:05,999
All I asked you was to develop my boilers.

463
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:08,442
I never stopped a moment...

464
00:36:09,746 --> 00:36:12,313
to think about
how you were living,

465
00:36:15,038 --> 00:36:18,068
or what was worrying you.

466
00:36:19,913 --> 00:36:30,590
That hurts me even more than
seeing our core technology get stolen.

467
00:36:33,421 --> 00:36:40,714
It's a relief that you'll soon start working
at Manbo Construction's research lab.

468
00:36:43,087 --> 00:36:45,436
Take good care of Minsu.

469
00:36:49,113 --> 00:36:54,247
I'll take this opportunity
to look at our employees...

470
00:36:54,869 --> 00:36:57,430
as if they were my own family.

471
00:37:01,271 --> 00:37:03,194
I'm sorry.

472
00:37:05,684 --> 00:37:07,939
I'm sorry, President.

473
00:37:33,412 --> 00:37:34,873
Soojeong.

474
00:37:35,214 --> 00:37:37,176
Let's have an interview.

475
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:40,324
I'm sorry.

476
00:37:40,418 --> 00:37:42,867
- The people know nothing about you...
- I'm sorry,

477
00:37:42,975 --> 00:37:45,073
no interviews for the time being.

478
00:37:45,191 --> 00:37:46,835
Wait a moment.

479
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:50,554
Have you heard the rumors?

480
00:37:50,923 --> 00:37:52,826
What rumors?

481
00:37:54,329 --> 00:37:57,417
About Cha Soojeong
being the mother of a child.

482
00:37:57,694 --> 00:37:59,092
What?!

483
00:38:00,932 --> 00:38:03,003
Speak the truth!

484
00:38:05,517 --> 00:38:07,537
I apologize.

485
00:38:07,925 --> 00:38:11,944
I always planned to at least tell you.

486
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:15,045
You told me your private
life was completely clean!

487
00:38:16,513 --> 00:38:19,227
If people learn of this, it's all over.

488
00:38:19,558 --> 00:38:23,186
Everything you've achieved
so far will be in vain, got it?

489
00:38:24,713 --> 00:38:28,095
Quit your singing career and leave.

490
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,038
Director...

491
00:38:30,644 --> 00:38:35,021
Think people will accept an
unmarried mother as a singer?

492
00:38:35,138 --> 00:38:39,649
Think you'll be able to continue
acting like a star while hiding that?

493
00:38:40,007 --> 00:38:41,917
I have no confidence in someone like you.

494
00:38:42,221 --> 00:38:45,981
Before those rumors end up
on a tabloid, quit on your own.

495
00:38:46,298 --> 00:38:47,988
Are we clear?

496
00:38:48,794 --> 00:38:49,844
I...

497
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,923
did nothing wrong.

498
00:38:53,215 --> 00:38:54,079
What?

499
00:38:54,202 --> 00:38:57,585
Not telling you was certainly wrong,

500
00:38:58,071 --> 00:39:02,514
but I don't believe that giving birth
to a child without a father is a sin.

501
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:05,615
Are you kidding me?

502
00:39:06,386 --> 00:39:10,736
Because if I committed any sin,
that would make my son a sinner, too.

503
00:39:11,292 --> 00:39:13,779
What did that poor
child ever do wrong?

504
00:39:14,366 --> 00:39:16,697
If being born that way is a sin,

505
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:20,585
then how can that boy go on living?

506
00:39:28,765 --> 00:39:29,470
Hey!

507
00:39:29,552 --> 00:39:31,537
What did this poor
child ever do wrong?

508
00:39:31,666 --> 00:39:34,661
Do bar girls have to go
through so much scrutiny?

509
00:39:34,802 --> 00:39:37,398
Is it a sin to give birth to a child?

510
00:39:37,481 --> 00:39:39,970
Aigoo.... Really...

511
00:39:42,543 --> 00:39:46,513
Fine... The hell with this.
The hell with you and this place!

512
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:50,236
Think I won't find any other place?

513
00:39:52,574 --> 00:39:54,145
I'm sorry, baby.

514
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:57,575
I scared you, didn't I?
Don't cry, baby.

515
00:39:58,292 --> 00:40:00,359
I won't do it again, Jeongyeon.

516
00:40:00,465 --> 00:40:03,530
Mommy won't scream again.

517
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:06,314
Don't... Stop crying, Jeongyeon.

518
00:40:06,432 --> 00:40:08,858
I'm sorry...

519
00:40:24,282 --> 00:40:28,391
Thank you for everything
you did for me, Director.

520
00:40:29,002 --> 00:40:30,940
And sorry.

521
00:40:32,103 --> 00:40:38,687
Whatever damages I caused you,
I will do everything to pay them back.

522
00:40:42,058 --> 00:40:43,703
Don't go.

523
00:40:47,324 --> 00:40:49,263
Manager Park.
Come in.

524
00:40:49,404 --> 00:40:50,942
Yes!

525
00:40:54,055 --> 00:40:58,695
Find that reporter,
and keep him quiet at all cost.

526
00:40:59,129 --> 00:41:00,037
What?

527
00:41:00,213 --> 00:41:02,048
All right.

528
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:09,563
As you said, giving birth is no sin.

529
00:41:10,091 --> 00:41:13,163
But it can only damage your career.

530
00:41:13,281 --> 00:41:14,502
Director...

531
00:41:14,585 --> 00:41:16,781
Limit your meetings with him.

532
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,495
And should any strange rumors
start spreading, don't let them get to you.

533
00:41:19,929 --> 00:41:21,515
You better be careful as well.

534
00:41:21,691 --> 00:41:23,794
- Yes, Director.
- All right.

535
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:32,089
And don't you ever
cry because of this again.

536
00:41:32,975 --> 00:41:34,708
I don't like it.

537
00:41:40,566 --> 00:41:42,599
Soojeong...

538
00:42:01,502 --> 00:42:04,129
The director is here.

539
00:42:07,642 --> 00:42:09,592
Director.

540
00:42:10,054 --> 00:42:12,071
Have a seat.

541
00:42:14,115 --> 00:42:17,539
So you said you're
meeting investors today?

542
00:42:17,665 --> 00:42:18,822
Yes.

543
00:42:18,928 --> 00:42:22,401
I have a dinner tonight with five chairmen
from the Korean Federation of Industries.

544
00:42:22,542 --> 00:42:23,706
Really?

545
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,030
Which companies?

546
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:30,588
Joyang Chemicals, Golden Group, Taeyang Group
Oseong Electric and Cheonha Heavy Industries.

547
00:42:30,768 --> 00:42:33,098
How much do you plan to raise?

548
00:42:33,203 --> 00:42:36,025
For starters, I think over five billion.

549
00:42:36,166 --> 00:42:39,287
If we add all other companies
affiliated with the Olympic Support Committee,

550
00:42:39,405 --> 00:42:42,670
I think reaching the
ten billion might be possible.

551
00:42:43,351 --> 00:42:48,003
Baekpa always used to
say that money has a soul.

552
00:42:48,698 --> 00:42:49,671
What?

553
00:42:49,847 --> 00:42:55,462
And that whomever is able to capture
that soul can successfully conclude any deal.

554
00:42:57,518 --> 00:43:02,427
He meant that you should never look
at the money, but at whom is investing it.

555
00:43:03,167 --> 00:43:06,644
Thank you, Director.
I will bear it in mind.

556
00:43:06,773 --> 00:43:08,688
No need to thank me.

557
00:43:09,064 --> 00:43:13,016
Since I only said so
hoping you will succeed.

558
00:43:13,368 --> 00:43:15,342
Yes, Director.

559
00:43:45,102 --> 00:43:46,216
How did it go?

560
00:43:46,275 --> 00:43:48,037
Did they leave?

561
00:43:48,166 --> 00:43:51,186
They all went to the golf course.

562
00:43:51,814 --> 00:43:53,384
The golf course?!

563
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:56,190
We had an appointment for today.

564
00:43:56,295 --> 00:44:00,113
Their secretaries all said
that the meeting would take place there.

565
00:44:00,372 --> 00:44:02,979
They never informed me of that?

566
00:44:03,155 --> 00:44:04,410
Who changed those plans?

567
00:44:04,528 --> 00:44:06,141
Where is this golf course?

568
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:16,870
Come on in, Director Hwang.

569
00:44:21,703 --> 00:44:23,624
We've heard from Director
Hwang Jeongshik already.

570
00:44:23,754 --> 00:44:27,054
If it was really urgent, you could
have just canceled the meeting.

571
00:44:27,125 --> 00:44:29,721
Didn't I come on my
sister's behalf, Chairman?

572
00:44:29,803 --> 00:44:33,744
I've had a good time, thanks to you.

573
00:44:37,186 --> 00:44:38,871
I apologize.

574
00:44:38,959 --> 00:44:42,448
- Have you had lunch...
- We were just about to get up.

575
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:46,423
We've already discussed
business with Director Hwang here.

576
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:49,935
We'll let you talk with your brother.

577
00:44:50,029 --> 00:44:52,566
- Here, let's get up.
- Right.

578
00:44:52,684 --> 00:44:54,281
- See you next time.
- Yes.

579
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:56,583
- See you again.
- See you soon.

580
00:44:56,688 --> 00:44:58,750
See you again, Chairman.

581
00:45:04,259 --> 00:45:06,032
Sit down a moment.

582
00:45:13,685 --> 00:45:15,447
What are you trying to do?

583
00:45:16,081 --> 00:45:20,016
I'm working under President Noh Gapsoo.

584
00:45:20,227 --> 00:45:23,052
- I know.
- Really?

585
00:45:23,627 --> 00:45:25,013
That's surprising.

586
00:45:25,107 --> 00:45:27,093
To hear you show any interest for me.

587
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:31,350
Are you trying to steal
clients under my nose?

588
00:45:31,450 --> 00:45:32,707
No.

589
00:45:33,729 --> 00:45:36,056
I'm afraid that won't be enough.

590
00:45:37,102 --> 00:45:41,730
I'm actually trying to bring
you and your mother down.

591
00:45:42,235 --> 00:45:43,245
What?

592
00:45:43,374 --> 00:45:46,417
Do you even know why my mother died?

593
00:45:48,185 --> 00:45:49,970
It was because of your family.

594
00:45:51,016 --> 00:45:53,024
You and your mother...

595
00:45:53,494 --> 00:45:54,763
Your father.

596
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,454
Stop it right now.

597
00:45:56,537 --> 00:45:57,923
Say what?

598
00:46:00,827 --> 00:46:05,489
You really think you can
secure any investment from them?

599
00:46:05,583 --> 00:46:09,847
- Hwang Jeongshik!
- I'm Hwang Taeseop's son to them,

600
00:46:09,988 --> 00:46:11,949
not to mention your brother.

601
00:46:13,183 --> 00:46:16,040
They'll soon invest in me.

602
00:46:17,374 --> 00:46:19,846
Thank you for keeping me on my toes.

603
00:46:21,193 --> 00:46:26,095
It was a welcome wake up call.

604
00:46:26,344 --> 00:46:28,997
- What?
- Let's do it.

605
00:46:29,492 --> 00:46:33,496
I'll give my best,
so give it your all as well.

606
00:46:34,330 --> 00:46:41,095
It looks much more dignified than wasting
your life away on the poker table.

607
00:46:50,739 --> 00:46:52,117
Fine...

608
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:56,540
You'll keep looking down on
me to the very end, won't you?

609
00:46:57,728 --> 00:47:03,893
Let's see if you'll have such kind words
when I force bitter tears out of you.

610
00:47:51,454 --> 00:47:53,584
Want me to help you?

611
00:47:55,851 --> 00:47:58,482
You're Kang Wooju, right?

612
00:47:58,646 --> 00:48:00,815
Don't you remember me?

613
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:09,002
Want some chocolate?

614
00:48:09,167 --> 00:48:10,694
My teeth will rot.

615
00:48:10,776 --> 00:48:13,968
Mommy said I shouldn't eat that.

616
00:48:14,966 --> 00:48:17,198
It'll rot your teeth, right...

617
00:48:18,066 --> 00:48:20,041
Did you eat lunch?

618
00:48:20,957 --> 00:48:22,986
Must be hungry.

619
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,456
You like jjajangmyeon, right?

620
00:48:26,273 --> 00:48:28,776
Want me to buy you jjajangmyeon?

621
00:48:30,644 --> 00:48:32,066
You don't want to?

622
00:48:32,221 --> 00:48:38,115
Mommy said I shouldn't follow strangers.

623
00:48:38,502 --> 00:48:39,852
She did?!

624
00:48:39,946 --> 00:48:42,448
Our Wooju is really clever?!

625
00:48:43,059 --> 00:48:46,448
Mommy's name is Lee Miju, right?

626
00:48:46,583 --> 00:48:47,628
Yes.

627
00:48:47,834 --> 00:48:50,287
See? I even know her name.

628
00:48:50,391 --> 00:48:56,861
So do Mommy and this
ajeosshi know each other or not?

629
00:49:02,570 --> 00:49:06,141
Let's go eat jjajangmyeon.

630
00:49:26,681 --> 00:49:28,713
Is it that good?

631
00:49:29,847 --> 00:49:30,909
Wooju.

632
00:49:31,050 --> 00:49:33,324
Is there anything you'd like to have?

633
00:49:33,432 --> 00:49:35,553
I'll buy it for you.

634
00:49:35,652 --> 00:49:37,812
- Really?
- Sure...

635
00:49:37,918 --> 00:49:41,947
This ajeosshi here can buy you anything.

636
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:43,321
Let's hear it.

637
00:49:43,497 --> 00:49:44,882
What do you want?

638
00:49:44,990 --> 00:49:47,085
A father.

639
00:49:48,764 --> 00:49:53,322
I wish I had a father, too.

640
00:49:53,416 --> 00:49:58,638
But Mommy said my father is in heaven.

641
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:04,558
I wish you could be my father.

642
00:50:14,593 --> 00:50:16,543
Here...

643
00:50:30,714 --> 00:50:32,042
Wooju.

644
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:37,951
You and I meeting today...
Let's keep it a secret, shall we?

645
00:50:38,113 --> 00:50:39,394
Yes.

646
00:50:39,652 --> 00:50:41,367
Promise.

647
00:50:41,543 --> 00:50:43,740
Seal.

648
00:50:56,877 --> 00:50:57,702
What?!

649
00:50:57,807 --> 00:50:59,299
Canceled?!

650
00:50:59,513 --> 00:51:02,694
Are you telling me Cha Soojeong
will be left out of this live broadcast?

651
00:51:02,904 --> 00:51:06,690
I mean... We even finished
rehearsals, what is all this about?

652
00:51:06,783 --> 00:51:07,707
Hello?

653
00:51:07,798 --> 00:51:09,303
Hello?

654
00:51:12,368 --> 00:51:13,728
What happened?

655
00:51:13,836 --> 00:51:15,998
First they started canceling
all those radio appearances,

656
00:51:16,115 --> 00:51:19,238
and now even TV?

657
00:51:29,797 --> 00:51:31,151
I'm late.

658
00:51:31,245 --> 00:51:33,630
Let's go, or PD Kim will scold me.

659
00:51:33,712 --> 00:51:34,946
Soojeong.

660
00:51:35,145 --> 00:51:38,629
Your gig was c.... canceled.

661
00:51:38,892 --> 00:51:39,996
What?

662
00:51:40,453 --> 00:51:43,238
It was canceled?

663
00:51:46,283 --> 00:51:48,780
All the broadcast gigs are off the schedule?!

664
00:51:49,402 --> 00:51:51,106
Were they all canceled?

665
00:51:51,369 --> 00:51:53,338
They didn't tell us the reason,

666
00:51:53,584 --> 00:51:56,028
but there must have been
some outside pressure involved.

667
00:51:56,829 --> 00:51:58,889
Outside pressure?!

668
00:51:59,112 --> 00:52:01,978
So someone is trying to
prevent me from appearing on TV?

669
00:52:02,365 --> 00:52:04,632
I'll be damned...

670
00:52:07,851 --> 00:52:09,307
Revenge?!

671
00:52:09,425 --> 00:52:12,616
And you little tramp
would get revenge against me?

672
00:52:12,741 --> 00:52:16,168
Coming here was a grave mistake.

673
00:52:16,591 --> 00:52:20,467
Since you'll soon find out
how scary and cruel life can get.

674
00:52:22,789 --> 00:52:26,517
We better let the director know, Soojeong.

675
00:52:26,681 --> 00:52:28,029
Wait a little longer.

676
00:52:28,155 --> 00:52:29,665
I need to verify something first.

677
00:52:29,759 --> 00:52:30,992
Verify?

678
00:52:31,145 --> 00:52:32,919
I'll be right back.

679
00:52:41,182 --> 00:52:42,713
Congressman.

680
00:52:42,817 --> 00:52:45,344
Cha Soojeong is waiting outside.

681
00:52:45,459 --> 00:52:46,983
Cha Soojeong?

682
00:52:47,170 --> 00:52:49,267
We have no reason to meet.
Send her packing.

683
00:52:49,661 --> 00:52:51,182
All right.

684
00:52:59,292 --> 00:53:01,257
Ten minutes... No.

685
00:53:01,367 --> 00:53:03,542
Five minutes is all I need.

686
00:53:05,821 --> 00:53:09,004
My broadcast appearances
have suddenly been canceled.

687
00:53:09,202 --> 00:53:11,306
Were you behind that?

688
00:53:12,334 --> 00:53:14,701
I thought I gave you a word of warning?

689
00:53:14,830 --> 00:53:15,864
Give me back my gigs.

690
00:53:15,957 --> 00:53:17,684
You were the one who ignored my warnings.

691
00:53:17,743 --> 00:53:19,416
I won't meet Minwoo again.

692
00:53:19,481 --> 00:53:21,008
We have no reason to.

693
00:53:21,102 --> 00:53:22,758
I see you don't get the point.

694
00:53:23,019 --> 00:53:26,280
I don't like the fact that you're a singer.

695
00:53:26,374 --> 00:53:28,098
And I certainly don't want to
see you prance around on TV...

696
00:53:28,204 --> 00:53:30,259
and make Minwoo increasingly miserable.

697
00:53:30,377 --> 00:53:34,969
Singing might not look all that special to you,

698
00:53:35,146 --> 00:53:36,978
but it's the dream of a lifetime to me.

699
00:53:37,084 --> 00:53:38,435
Aren't those five minutes up?

700
00:53:38,517 --> 00:53:39,757
Let's go.

701
00:53:41,042 --> 00:53:45,585
Just because you don't approve of it,
can you really ruin someone's life this way?

702
00:53:45,705 --> 00:53:49,853
Is that what this mighty
authority of yours is all about?

703
00:53:51,556 --> 00:53:54,528
I'm stopping at this just for Minwoo's sake.

704
00:53:55,115 --> 00:53:57,663
Keep trying to rile me up,

705
00:53:57,953 --> 00:54:03,383
and I'll make you experience what
our mighty authority really feels like.

706
00:54:04,617 --> 00:54:06,680
If you really want to sing,

707
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:10,340
go do it on some stage
away from people's attention.

708
00:54:10,463 --> 00:54:12,836
I'll allow that much.

709
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:14,998
You just wait.

710
00:54:15,104 --> 00:54:18,898
As I won't let this slide, either.

711
00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:20,791
You lowly little tramp...

712
00:54:20,907 --> 00:54:24,295
Think a little make-up is all you
need to act all haughty around me?

713
00:54:48,426 --> 00:54:49,788
Reporter Kim.

714
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:51,655
Are you really sure?

715
00:54:52,125 --> 00:54:57,282
I did receive a report that Kang Wooju's
mother looks exactly like Cha Soojeong.

716
00:54:57,764 --> 00:55:02,740
Her son frequents
that kindergarten, is that it?

717
00:55:02,864 --> 00:55:03,875
Yes.

718
00:55:04,005 --> 00:55:07,153
So let's find out.

719
00:55:24,818 --> 00:55:27,436
You're Wooju.

720
00:55:27,627 --> 00:55:29,561
Who are you?

721
00:55:31,566 --> 00:55:34,729
Is your mother's name Cha Soojeong?

722
00:55:34,897 --> 00:55:36,291
No.

723
00:55:37,078 --> 00:55:38,335
It's not Cha Soojeong?

724
00:55:38,453 --> 00:55:40,121
It's not.

725
00:55:40,426 --> 00:55:43,150
Then...
What's your mother's name?

726
00:55:43,326 --> 00:55:45,757
It's Lee Miju.

727
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:49,140
Is it really Lee Miju?

728
00:55:49,246 --> 00:55:50,537
Yes.

729
00:55:57,239 --> 00:56:00,470
I guess it was a false report, after all.

730
00:56:00,682 --> 00:56:02,843
Allow me to apologize.

731
00:56:16,862 --> 00:56:18,060
Soojeong.

732
00:56:19,701 --> 00:56:21,875
How have you been, Deputy?

733
00:56:22,028 --> 00:56:23,508
What brings you here?

734
00:56:23,602 --> 00:56:27,478
She probably has a
meeting for the promo shoot.

735
00:56:27,608 --> 00:56:29,577
Is that so?

736
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:32,612
- Then, why don't you show her the way?
- Yes.

737
00:56:32,811 --> 00:56:35,713
No. That won't be necessary.

738
00:56:36,315 --> 00:56:37,689
All right, then.

739
00:56:37,830 --> 00:56:39,498
I'm a little busy today.

740
00:56:39,627 --> 00:56:40,637
See you next time.

741
00:56:40,731 --> 00:56:42,728
Yes, Deputy.

742
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:47,567
Deputy?!

743
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:55,864
I examined the boiler
projects you sent me.

744
00:56:57,203 --> 00:57:04,268
It seems that boilers will decide
who wins the Suseo sale, after all.

745
00:57:07,615 --> 00:57:10,012
Well, if you allow me to
get straight to the point,

746
00:57:10,528 --> 00:57:14,062
when it comes to the Korean-style
ondol-based boiler you presented,

747
00:57:14,521 --> 00:57:18,197
Manbo Construction seems to have the edge.

748
00:57:21,016 --> 00:57:26,499
After you acquired Beaute
Boilers, I had high expectations,

749
00:57:27,357 --> 00:57:29,048
so I'm honestly a little surprised.

750
00:57:29,979 --> 00:57:32,678
Our development process
still hasn't been completed.

751
00:57:32,851 --> 00:57:37,318
We will satisfy your
expectations before the sale begins.

752
00:57:37,643 --> 00:57:40,343
And will that be so easy to achieve?

753
00:57:41,141 --> 00:57:46,803
Because you can't develop a technology
out of the blue with hard work alone.

754
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:55,983
Jo Minwoo.

755
00:58:02,456 --> 00:58:04,347
I might not like the way you did it,

756
00:58:04,499 --> 00:58:07,572
but I do acknowledge that you
found a solution to those flaws.

757
00:58:08,279 --> 00:58:11,995
Your boiler research lab seems
to have quite the potential?!

758
00:58:12,114 --> 00:58:15,713
Don't act all accommodating with me.
It makes me sick.

759
00:58:16,664 --> 00:58:18,740
Maybe I have a good reason to do so.

760
00:58:18,881 --> 00:58:23,098
And if this Suseo apartment construction
ends up becoming your last,

761
00:58:23,384 --> 00:58:25,165
will you say the same thing?

762
00:58:25,788 --> 00:58:28,477
- Try to make it happen, if you can.
- Hey, Lee Gangmo.

763
00:58:28,665 --> 00:58:31,238
Manbo Construction, Daeryuk Construction...

764
00:58:31,419 --> 00:58:33,948
Already forgot who made them collapse?

765
00:58:34,735 --> 00:58:39,293
If I only wanted, I could destroy
Hangang Construction in a heartbeat.

766
00:58:39,645 --> 00:58:41,031
You know that?

767
00:59:20,898 --> 00:59:22,425
Chairman!

768
00:59:27,837 --> 00:59:30,415
I'll stop by the research lab on my way home.

769
00:59:45,337 --> 00:59:48,341
Chairman.

770
00:59:49,010 --> 00:59:50,894
Go ahead.

771
00:59:57,146 --> 00:59:58,987
Is anything the matter?

772
00:59:59,128 --> 01:00:04,344
I just learned this...

773
01:00:04,449 --> 01:00:07,750
Cha Soojeong.... No.

774
01:00:07,879 --> 01:00:13,083
Lee Miju has been hiding a son.

775
01:00:14,704 --> 01:00:18,283
Here's the child's census register.

776
01:00:27,083 --> 01:00:32,216
- Kang Wooju -

777
01:00:39,766 --> 01:00:41,553
Grandma...

778
01:00:45,601 --> 01:00:49,266
He's registered as son
of a certain Kang Jeongja,

779
01:00:49,406 --> 01:00:52,124
but she's too old to have a child.

780
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:55,507
The mother is clearly Lee Miju,

781
01:00:55,589 --> 01:00:58,049
but as for the father...

782
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:00,190
Turn the car around.

783
01:01:00,565 --> 01:01:01,389
What?

784
01:01:01,518 --> 01:01:03,374
Bring me to this child right now.

785
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:06,522
By now, the kindergarten might already...

786
01:01:06,628 --> 01:01:08,766
I said turn around!

787
01:01:28,663 --> 01:01:33,127
See you, Wooju.

788
01:01:34,214 --> 01:01:35,987
Chairman...

789
01:01:36,610 --> 01:01:38,080
It's that boy.

Are you suggesting we change our
marketing strategy based on groundless rumors?

796
01:02:18,747 --> 01:02:20,791
You've found yourself
quite the remarkable sponsor.

797
01:02:20,885 --> 01:02:24,961
Hangang Construction
will be added to the list.

798
01:02:25,090 --> 01:02:28,654
I know who killed Lee Gangmo's father.

799
01:02:28,762 --> 01:02:31,314
Chairman Hwang is meeting
those opposition party members.

800
01:02:31,420 --> 01:02:33,605
Find out everything about that account.

801
01:02:33,699 --> 01:02:37,595
If I don't pay back those
forty million, they'll kill me, Dad.

802
01:02:37,702 --> 01:02:41,228
Don't you ever gamble
again, and just work under me.

803
01:02:41,322 --> 01:02:44,476
- It's Lee Miju's son.
- Are you telling me Minwoo is the father?

804
01:02:44,584 --> 01:02:46,366
Here are the results of the DNA test.

805
01:02:46,483 --> 01:02:49,208
