4
00:00:11,894 --> 00:00:12,948
Chief.

5
00:00:13,161 --> 00:00:15,403
Did you look into that James Lee?

6
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,258
It was right as you suggested.

7
00:00:17,364 --> 00:00:22,281
It's the same James Lee as the
owner of those Gaepo-Dong mudflats.

8
00:00:23,664 --> 00:00:27,769
Didn't that land belong
to the late Lee Gangmo?

9
00:00:28,031 --> 00:00:29,098
Good job.

10
00:00:29,283 --> 00:00:30,343
You can go.

11
00:00:30,506 --> 00:00:32,092
Yes, Chief.

12
00:00:35,965 --> 00:00:38,469
James Lee...

13
00:00:39,007 --> 00:00:41,089
Lee Gangmo...

14
00:00:43,331 --> 00:00:45,771
James Lee...

15
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,649
How do you feel about this?

16
00:00:55,869 --> 00:01:00,440
I'd like to accept Hangang
Construction as a new memb...

17
00:01:00,557 --> 00:01:02,507
I'm against it.

18
00:01:04,167 --> 00:01:09,028
It's a medium-sized firm that barely
has a highway project to its name,

19
00:01:09,315 --> 00:01:11,518
and you want us to accept it
into the construction committee?

20
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,449
<i>I might oppose
Chairman Cheon's exclusion,</i>

21
00:01:14,559 --> 00:01:18,329
but I'm a little perplexed
about this recommendation, myself.

22
00:01:18,427 --> 00:01:21,389
I'm against that as well.

23
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,557
Same goes for me.

24
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,807
I'd like a word with you.

25
00:01:32,772 --> 00:01:37,576
Let's talk in private.

26
00:01:49,788 --> 00:01:51,768
Gangmo, you...

27
00:01:52,016 --> 00:01:54,258
Why are you doing this to me?

28
00:01:54,956 --> 00:02:00,421
If you were alive,
you should have come to me first!

29
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:07,613
Why are you trying to strangle
Manbo Construction behind my back?

30
00:02:08,181 --> 00:02:10,539
Hwang Jeongshik and Jo Minwoo,

31
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,048
just for the sake of getting their
hands on those Gaepo-Dong mudflats,

32
00:02:14,471 --> 00:02:16,336
attempted to kill me.

33
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:19,120
What?!

34
00:02:19,726 --> 00:02:21,837
Jeongshik and... Minwoo?!

35
00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:29,767
Thanks to them, I learned quite a
few life lessons at the Samcheong camp.

36
00:02:31,601 --> 00:02:36,536
When I'd heard you were
taken to the Samcheong camp,

37
00:02:37,235 --> 00:02:39,914
the thought did cross my mind...

38
00:02:40,132 --> 00:02:42,501
I have no intention...

39
00:02:44,058 --> 00:02:46,765
to forgive the people
who did this to me.

40
00:02:47,436 --> 00:02:49,314
Yeah...

41
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:52,473
I can understand.

42
00:02:53,638 --> 00:02:55,658
You must be feeling wronged.

43
00:02:55,858 --> 00:02:58,741
You must be livid about it all.

44
00:02:59,496 --> 00:03:03,574
<i>Still, Gangmo.</i>

45
00:03:04,812 --> 00:03:08,131
If only for Jeongyeon's sake and mine,

46
00:03:09,296 --> 00:03:12,417
you must forgive them.

47
00:03:14,146 --> 00:03:16,843
Do you know what
happened to Jeongyeon...

48
00:03:17,453 --> 00:03:21,764
when she heard you'd died?

49
00:03:25,461 --> 00:03:28,953
I'll do everything you ask.

50
00:03:29,637 --> 00:03:34,252
Come back to me, Gangmo.

51
00:03:35,796 --> 00:03:37,880
If you only help Jeongyeon,

52
00:03:37,973 --> 00:03:40,192
Manbo Construction could be...

53
00:03:42,842 --> 00:03:44,226
Right...

54
00:03:44,404 --> 00:03:46,064
Gangmo.

55
00:03:46,544 --> 00:03:49,892
You two get married.

56
00:03:50,184 --> 00:03:51,823
<i>I'll give you my consent.</i>

57
00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:53,669
Wouldn't that be enough?

58
00:03:53,838 --> 00:03:56,535
Gangmo. Uh?!

59
00:03:57,093 --> 00:04:03,000
I've heard Gaepo will soon be announced
as a residential development zone.

60
00:04:03,611 --> 00:04:09,158
I plan to build
apartments on that land.

61
00:04:09,478 --> 00:04:11,036
Sure.

62
00:04:11,429 --> 00:04:13,632
Of course you should.

63
00:04:13,846 --> 00:04:16,481
If you bring that land
and come back to me,

64
00:04:16,699 --> 00:04:22,712
then I'll let you build a new city
in Manbo Construction's name.

65
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:26,087
I need a construction permit.

66
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:31,502
And the reason I want
to join the committee...

67
00:04:31,837 --> 00:04:34,294
is exactly that.

68
00:04:34,819 --> 00:04:38,982
Because with the
committee's joint liability,

69
00:04:39,448 --> 00:04:42,928
the City Council will
automatically issue that permit.

70
00:04:44,238 --> 00:04:49,144
So you really want us to part ways?

71
00:04:50,307 --> 00:04:59,916
Didn't giving you that land
make up for all I did to you?

72
00:05:01,415 --> 00:05:03,393
Jeongshik and Minwoo!

73
00:05:03,493 --> 00:05:05,332
I'll make them
repent for what they did.

74
00:05:05,478 --> 00:05:08,710
If you ask me to punish them, I will.

75
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:11,166
And should that not be enough...

76
00:05:11,261 --> 00:05:14,592
<i>And what will you do to make up...</i>

77
00:05:15,785 --> 00:05:17,853
for killing my father?

78
00:05:18,304 --> 00:05:20,561
What is that supposed to mean?

79
00:05:21,878 --> 00:05:26,376
You fool...
Make up for killing your father?!

80
00:05:26,653 --> 00:05:29,128
And who on earth is your father?

81
00:05:30,482 --> 00:05:32,214
Lee...

82
00:05:34,733 --> 00:05:36,698
Dae...

83
00:05:38,008 --> 00:05:40,660
Soo is his name.

84
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,629
Lee...

85
00:05:43,255 --> 00:05:44,740
Dae...

86
00:05:49,675 --> 00:05:51,801
Lee Daesoo?!

87
00:06:16,133 --> 00:06:19,238
Then, you?!

88
00:06:21,592 --> 00:06:27,467
The man you and Jo Pilyeon
killed a long time ago...

89
00:06:31,922 --> 00:06:34,208
Lee Daesoo...

90
00:06:37,119 --> 00:06:42,768
is my one and only father.

91
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,793
Do you...

92
00:06:53,278 --> 00:06:55,461
Do you...

93
00:06:56,678 --> 00:06:59,898
finally understand the reason why...

94
00:07:00,341 --> 00:07:02,664
I'll never be able to forgive you?

95
00:07:09,536 --> 00:07:15,909
If you want to stop me,
then why don't you try?

96
00:07:28,997 --> 00:07:35,466
Gangmo was Lee Daesoo's son?!

97
00:07:37,461 --> 00:07:43,546
The same son I spent
so long looking for...

98
00:07:43,735 --> 00:07:46,734
was Lee Gangmo?!

99
00:08:21,673 --> 00:08:23,580
What is the matter?

100
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:28,297
What happened with James Lee,
to leave you in this state?

101
00:08:35,853 --> 00:08:37,543
Gyeongok...

102
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:42,274
Looks like I'm getting punished.

103
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:48,639
For abandoning you,

104
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:54,589
for my friend...
and what I did...

105
00:09:08,462 --> 00:09:12,102
It is only natural you'd be against
accepting me into the committee.

106
00:09:13,092 --> 00:09:15,494
So let's settle for one condition.

107
00:09:15,771 --> 00:09:18,552
<i>You know better than anyone that,
when you build apartments,</i>

108
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:21,173
<i>you first need to deal with
the roads surrounding them.</i>

109
00:09:21,406 --> 00:09:23,502
If you accept me into the committee,

110
00:09:23,881 --> 00:09:26,050
I will make sure all
the chairmen present here...

111
00:09:26,327 --> 00:09:32,325
can employ our new method for the
next three years, free of charge.

112
00:09:56,536 --> 00:09:58,655
Visit for you.

113
00:10:07,512 --> 00:10:09,652
Your clout never fails to amaze me.

114
00:10:09,844 --> 00:10:13,626
Allowing me to
walk freely at this time.

115
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:15,941
I must ask for your forgiveness.

116
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:17,746
I understand your position.

117
00:10:17,935 --> 00:10:22,493
Min Honggi got the big suits involved,
so there was nothing you could do.

118
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:26,140
To be really honest, this whole
ordeal really hurt my pride.

119
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:30,481
Min Honggi was under us
back in the military.

120
00:10:34,674 --> 00:10:39,451
You still have all that data
on politicians, right?

121
00:10:41,227 --> 00:10:45,697
With my past experience at
the KCIA, I'm well aware...

122
00:10:45,842 --> 00:10:48,099
that you're secretly
investigating the entire junta.

123
00:10:48,286 --> 00:10:50,807
Why are you asking?

124
00:10:50,952 --> 00:10:52,731
Give it to me.

125
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:56,180
Just the data concerning the
big shots currently in office.

126
00:10:56,384 --> 00:10:57,628
And what would you do with that?

127
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,179
I swear,

128
00:10:59,378 --> 00:11:03,488
you won't have to face any
repercussions because of this.

129
00:11:05,687 --> 00:11:09,515
I can't waste an entire year in here.

130
00:11:09,821 --> 00:11:12,149
If nobody is going
to get me out of here,

131
00:11:12,294 --> 00:11:16,503
I'll have to give them
a good reason to do so.

132
00:11:16,705 --> 00:11:22,107
Not to mention the connections
I'll need to deal with Min Honggi later.

133
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:24,057
Would that data be enough?

134
00:11:24,203 --> 00:11:26,154
I'm sure you know me already,

135
00:11:26,381 --> 00:11:30,793
but I never fail to make it up,
be it debts of gratitude or affronts.

136
00:11:31,263 --> 00:11:33,199
<i>I need to make up for all you did,</i>

137
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:36,570
and also get revenge against Min Honggi.

138
00:11:38,867 --> 00:11:41,083
Chief, what brings you here?

139
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:45,029
Ohh... He's a close friend of mine,

140
00:11:45,195 --> 00:11:47,742
<i>and he'll make it big once he's out.</i>

141
00:11:47,903 --> 00:11:51,066
Take good care of him on my behalf.

142
00:11:51,174 --> 00:11:52,402
Yes.

143
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,622
I'll give you what you asked for.

144
00:11:56,463 --> 00:11:58,487
Thanks, Chief Oh.

145
00:12:15,152 --> 00:12:19,461
If you take a look here,
it's the direct opposite.

146
00:12:21,238 --> 00:12:25,517
Ahh...
Done that way, it's much simpler!

147
00:12:25,929 --> 00:12:27,613
You smile?!

148
00:12:27,895 --> 00:12:31,078
Oppa, you're really good
at explaining this.

149
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:33,594
"Oppa"?!

150
00:12:39,286 --> 00:12:41,053
Chief!

151
00:12:42,766 --> 00:12:44,762
Is he your boss?

152
00:12:45,037 --> 00:12:47,316
No... Actually...

153
00:12:47,512 --> 00:12:49,274
<i>I'm her boyfriend.</i>

154
00:12:50,016 --> 00:12:50,958
Who is he?

155
00:12:51,152 --> 00:12:54,690
He helps me with math
from time to time.

156
00:12:55,214 --> 00:12:57,710
Nice to meet you, I'm a Korea
University student, my name is Choi...

157
00:12:57,804 --> 00:12:59,131
Hurry and get up.

158
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:00,542
What?

159
00:13:00,993 --> 00:13:03,206
Are you just going
to keep sitting there?

160
00:13:03,789 --> 00:13:06,512
No need to help Miju out anymore.

161
00:13:10,195 --> 00:13:12,641
I'm sorry.

162
00:13:16,528 --> 00:13:18,042
What... "Chief"?!

163
00:13:18,261 --> 00:13:19,489
I'm sorry.

164
00:13:19,593 --> 00:13:20,953
It just became a habit...

165
00:13:21,045 --> 00:13:24,743
So when did he start
helping you, how and why?

166
00:13:25,476 --> 00:13:29,043
He happened to be sitting
next to me about a week ago,

167
00:13:29,203 --> 00:13:32,085
and seeing how I was
having problems with math...

168
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,798
But did you get angry
just because of that Oppa?

169
00:13:35,943 --> 00:13:38,799
Got used to calling him Oppa
already, haven't you?

170
00:13:39,463 --> 00:13:41,151
Forget how and when...

171
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:45,136
I mean, why was he
helping you to study, why?

172
00:13:45,246 --> 00:13:49,202
That's just because I'm
not too good at math, so...

173
00:13:49,319 --> 00:13:50,918
But, tell me.

174
00:13:51,044 --> 00:13:52,853
Why do you keep smiling at him?

175
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:54,027
Uh?

176
00:13:54,215 --> 00:13:56,948
Your lips looked about to burst.

177
00:14:12,453 --> 00:14:15,336
Are you still upset with me?

178
00:14:15,947 --> 00:14:17,367
Why would I?

179
00:14:17,621 --> 00:14:20,664
You're acting like someone who's upset.

180
00:14:21,072 --> 00:14:22,222
When did I ever?

181
00:14:22,341 --> 00:14:24,951
Ever since you came to the library.

182
00:14:27,614 --> 00:14:29,544
Don't smile in
any other man's presence.

183
00:14:29,797 --> 00:14:31,108
What?

184
00:14:32,432 --> 00:14:35,854
You're not jealous, are you?

185
00:14:36,698 --> 00:14:38,212
Hey...

186
00:14:38,678 --> 00:14:41,022
Jealousy... Yeah, right...

187
00:14:41,895 --> 00:14:43,749
I'm not jealous.

188
00:14:46,806 --> 00:14:48,659
I said I'm not!

189
00:14:49,005 --> 00:14:50,868
All right.

190
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:53,969
Don't even...

191
00:14:54,384 --> 00:14:56,080
talk with another man.

192
00:14:57,434 --> 00:14:59,829
Don't look at them, either.

193
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:03,280
And don't trust any man other than me.

194
00:15:03,687 --> 00:15:05,613
They're all thieves, got it?

195
00:15:05,886 --> 00:15:06,613
Yes.

196
00:15:06,704 --> 00:15:08,899
I'll do as you say.

197
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:12,466
I won't talk with any other man,
won't look at them,

198
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:15,442
and except you,
I won't trust anyone.

199
00:15:15,754 --> 00:15:17,574
Happy now?

200
00:15:33,715 --> 00:15:35,241
What are you doing this weekend?

201
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:36,719
I need to study.

202
00:15:36,889 --> 00:15:38,467
Come out here at two.

203
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:39,862
We're going to the library?

204
00:15:39,949 --> 00:15:41,853
On a date!

205
00:16:09,991 --> 00:16:13,689
<i>- Hangang Construction Admission Agreement -</i>

206
00:16:17,655 --> 00:16:22,929
<i>Approved / Rejected</i>

207
00:16:46,483 --> 00:16:48,026
Ahh... Hello?

208
00:16:48,213 --> 00:16:49,932
Lawyer Kim?

209
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:52,526
I didn't wake you up, did I?

210
00:16:53,181 --> 00:16:58,218
Yes... I needed to
talk about something.

211
00:16:59,427 --> 00:17:03,955
Is he talking with
the Royal Club owner?

212
00:17:11,118 --> 00:17:14,918
<i>You'd like to change your testament?</i>

213
00:17:16,636 --> 00:17:20,566
<i>Is it about the company inheritance?</i>

214
00:17:21,265 --> 00:17:26,704
<i>This must remain between you and me.</i>

215
00:17:27,167 --> 00:17:29,336
<i>Certainly, Chairman.</i>

216
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:37,547
What is he talking about?

217
00:17:37,781 --> 00:17:40,240
He wants to change his testament?!

218
00:17:41,255 --> 00:17:44,982
What on earth is he thinking?

219
00:18:02,975 --> 00:18:04,600
I'm back.

220
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:07,202
You're late.

221
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:13,067
Did you manage to meet
Hangang Construction's James Lee?

222
00:18:13,544 --> 00:18:16,184
He didn't come.

223
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:20,186
Just forget about them.

224
00:18:20,361 --> 00:18:22,705
There were rumors spreading
on the stock exchange.

225
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:26,970
It seems Hangang Construction is
looking for a permit to build apartments.

226
00:18:27,116 --> 00:18:30,242
I said stop concerning yourself
with Hangang Construction!

227
00:18:31,286 --> 00:18:33,558
D...Dad...

228
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:42,233
Did anything happen at
the committee meeting?

229
00:18:42,424 --> 00:18:44,490
Nothing.

230
00:18:44,811 --> 00:18:46,635
Go to sleep.

231
00:18:58,635 --> 00:19:02,202
Did you finish that survey
on the subcontractors?

232
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:07,690
Here you go.

233
00:19:08,185 --> 00:19:14,678
I only chose the very best
subcontractors in the business.

234
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:15,901
How about their asking price?

235
00:19:16,053 --> 00:19:20,123
All the people running these companies cut
their teeth on construction sites thanks to me,

236
00:19:20,254 --> 00:19:23,937
back when I'd just kick
them around like rag dolls.

237
00:19:24,054 --> 00:19:27,228
And since I know the estimates
down to the last penny,

238
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:30,541
they won't be able to bargain with me.

239
00:19:31,173 --> 00:19:34,068
Start meeting with them, then.

240
00:19:34,376 --> 00:19:36,986
And if their asking price fits what
we're looking for, just sign wth them.

241
00:19:37,162 --> 00:19:43,567
Aigoo... You still pay me peanuts
but expect me to work all day like an ox?

242
00:19:43,931 --> 00:19:45,183
What's wrong?

243
00:19:45,329 --> 00:19:47,760
Mister "Founding Director"
of Hangang Construction?!

244
00:19:48,488 --> 00:19:51,351
Just hearing you say that feels nice.

245
00:19:52,205 --> 00:19:54,396
Reporter Yoon is here.
Come on in.

246
00:19:54,498 --> 00:19:56,512
- Ohh... How are you?
- Come on in.

247
00:19:56,589 --> 00:19:58,472
- Bit late, right?
- Not at all.

248
00:19:59,244 --> 00:20:01,039
Here. Have a seat.
Some coffee, please.

249
00:20:01,115 --> 00:20:02,321
Yes!

250
00:20:02,461 --> 00:20:05,917
What are you waiting for? We have
a guest, so let's serve him coffee!

251
00:20:06,101 --> 00:20:08,847
Ehh...
A managing director serving coffee?

252
00:20:08,949 --> 00:20:12,588
Then, should a technical
director like me do it?

253
00:20:12,952 --> 00:20:16,466
I told you to scout Miss Choi
of the Honey Coffeehouse.

254
00:20:16,646 --> 00:20:19,570
While you're there,
give me a cup as well.

255
00:20:19,766 --> 00:20:22,779
The hell am I, Miss Park
of the Gangnam coffeehouse?

256
00:20:24,073 --> 00:20:26,587
Right... Seonsaengnim.

257
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,052
You spread those rumors
at the stock exchange, right?

258
00:20:29,212 --> 00:20:32,241
<i>{\a6}*Jjirashi: loanword from Japanese chirasu
(scatter); original meaning: propaganda leaflets</i>

259
00:20:29,212 --> 00:20:32,241
Tabloid* pieces about Manbo
Construction are starting to circulate.

260
00:20:32,386 --> 00:20:35,516
Their stock price was
falling as well, today.

261
00:20:36,725 --> 00:20:42,552
This will help you
with your reportage.

262
00:20:51,898 --> 00:20:55,943
Why is our stock price
falling so badly?

263
00:20:56,193 --> 00:20:58,318
We will soon take care of it.
You can rest assured.

264
00:20:58,431 --> 00:21:02,597
Isn't this all because we've decided
on a woman as our future chairman?

265
00:21:02,772 --> 00:21:05,366
And there were rumors at the stock
exchange that Manbo Construction...

266
00:21:05,465 --> 00:21:07,926
and Commissioner Han
Myeongseok are on bad terms,

267
00:21:08,086 --> 00:21:09,393
what is that all about?

268
00:21:09,556 --> 00:21:11,376
It's a groundless rumor
devoid of any truth.

269
00:21:11,543 --> 00:21:14,432
Chief, let Director Hwang
explain by herself!

270
00:21:14,543 --> 00:21:16,666
<i>We're well aware of how they took away
the highway project under your nose.</i>

271
00:21:16,797 --> 00:21:19,378
<i>What are you expecting,
some kind of gift from heaven?</i>

272
00:21:19,473 --> 00:21:21,572
Let's hear it!

273
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:24,717
Say something!

274
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,829
<i>What do you have to say?</i>

275
00:21:33,977 --> 00:21:38,982
Don't you think all those rumors
are a little too specific?

276
00:21:40,336 --> 00:21:44,219
So you're suggesting that someone
is spreading them on purpose?

277
00:21:44,412 --> 00:21:48,549
Ever met that man called James Lee?

278
00:21:49,991 --> 00:21:50,891
No.

279
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:52,771
Not yet.

280
00:21:53,528 --> 00:21:54,649
Is it him?

281
00:21:54,853 --> 00:22:00,822
Every obstacle in your way
comes from Hangang Construction.

282
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:05,213
Seemed like the chairman
knew James Lee quite well.

283
00:22:05,649 --> 00:22:08,124
What was his Korean name, again...

284
00:22:08,765 --> 00:22:11,994
<i>It was all too sudden
to remember it clearly...</i>

285
00:22:12,215 --> 00:22:13,919
Ahh... Right.

286
00:22:14,239 --> 00:22:19,932
He looked a lot like that boyfriend
you once came to the club with.

287
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:23,499
- By any chance, was his name...
- That is not possible.

288
00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:27,896
Because that man is dead.

289
00:22:28,594 --> 00:22:30,807
Is that so?

290
00:22:39,874 --> 00:22:42,495
Dirty bastard...

291
00:22:43,878 --> 00:22:45,271
Don't misunderstand.

292
00:22:45,523 --> 00:22:47,313
That was for James Lee.

293
00:22:47,459 --> 00:22:51,206
Did you even meet with
Commissioner Han?

294
00:22:52,865 --> 00:22:54,103
Leave me alone.

295
00:22:54,336 --> 00:22:57,003
If you find it too difficult,
I can always meet him.

296
00:22:57,335 --> 00:22:59,722
If anyone ever meets him,
that'll be me.

297
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:05,080
I thought I told you to leave?!

298
00:23:18,616 --> 00:23:20,364
What's the reason?

299
00:23:21,499 --> 00:23:25,484
What's the reason you try to
leave me out of every important task?

300
00:23:26,022 --> 00:23:30,463
Ever thought that I'm the
only one who can help you?

301
00:23:30,841 --> 00:23:32,256
Look around you!

302
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:34,320
Who is by your side now?

303
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,403
So you'd help me?

304
00:23:37,262 --> 00:23:39,226
Despite knowing how much I loved him,

305
00:23:39,386 --> 00:23:42,400
the same man who conspired with
Jeongshik and killed Gangmo,

306
00:23:42,895 --> 00:23:45,399
you would help me?

307
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:50,057
Don't even try to say it was
because you loved me.

308
00:23:50,421 --> 00:23:54,061
Because it is just for your sake,

309
00:23:54,629 --> 00:23:57,891
and to satisfy your father's ambitions,
that you do things like that.

310
00:24:00,118 --> 00:24:01,447
I'll hand you my resignation.

311
00:24:01,516 --> 00:24:03,379
Resignation?!

312
00:24:04,529 --> 00:24:08,329
So, what, are you going
to make it up for killing him...

313
00:24:08,664 --> 00:24:12,600
by simply leaving this company?

314
00:24:12,831 --> 00:24:15,278
What is it that you want?

315
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:18,306
Want to see me dead?

316
00:24:18,467 --> 00:24:20,155
No.

317
00:24:21,524 --> 00:24:25,658
For the rest of your days, I'll make
you painfully regret killing Gangmo.

318
00:24:28,285 --> 00:24:31,601
And, tell me, will you be able
to do that on your own?

319
00:24:31,735 --> 00:24:32,836
What?

320
00:24:32,987 --> 00:24:37,810
As you said, everything I do,
I'm forced to do it for my father's sake.

321
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:39,407
But...

322
00:24:40,366 --> 00:24:43,280
you always tried to stop me in some way.

323
00:24:44,469 --> 00:24:48,196
Do you really believe
you can win this fight,

324
00:24:49,041 --> 00:24:52,156
especially knowing that I have
no feelings left for you whatsoever?

325
00:25:06,746 --> 00:25:07,625
What?!

326
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:10,804
Jeongyeon found out?!

327
00:25:12,409 --> 00:25:14,098
It wasn't me!

328
00:25:14,331 --> 00:25:17,076
I didn't tell her anything!

329
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:20,093
<i>Hey... Stop worrying.</i>

330
00:25:20,276 --> 00:25:22,489
Even if she found out,
what can she do about it?

331
00:25:22,602 --> 00:25:24,920
Jo Minwoo is one of
Manbo Construction's pillars,

332
00:25:25,167 --> 00:25:27,628
would she go as far as firing you?

333
00:25:27,875 --> 00:25:30,991
Go pay a visit to Hangang
Construction's offices.

334
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:32,346
Hangang Construction?

335
00:25:32,476 --> 00:25:35,502
Find out who the president really is.

336
00:25:35,695 --> 00:25:41,125
You still believe that
James Lee might be Lee Gangmo?

337
00:25:42,043 --> 00:25:43,576
He could be.

338
00:25:44,066 --> 00:25:45,857
Then...

339
00:25:46,483 --> 00:25:49,599
If it turns out he's
really alive, what should I do?

340
00:25:49,817 --> 00:25:52,656
He was sentenced to
four years in prison.

341
00:25:53,049 --> 00:25:55,699
If he's alive and walking free,

342
00:25:56,325 --> 00:25:57,999
that would only mean jailbreaking.

343
00:25:58,176 --> 00:25:59,717
Jailbr...

344
00:26:01,391 --> 00:26:03,167
You have a point?!

345
00:26:03,605 --> 00:26:05,231
Don't you worry, Minwoo.

346
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:10,218
I'll find out what that
James Lee is all about.

347
00:26:15,997 --> 00:26:21,753
Are you really going
to make those changes?

348
00:26:23,369 --> 00:26:25,145
Who could this man possibly be,

349
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:27,853
to have him inherit all this fortune?

350
00:26:28,246 --> 00:26:30,837
Please, don't ask me anything.

351
00:26:31,968 --> 00:26:39,363
All you need to do after I'm dead
is proceeding as this testament states.

352
00:26:56,004 --> 00:27:01,216
This is the last change
this testament will go through.

353
00:27:01,926 --> 00:27:03,312
Here...

354
00:27:03,499 --> 00:27:06,137
You may leave.

355
00:27:06,938 --> 00:27:09,692
It's good, all right.

356
00:27:11,277 --> 00:27:14,514
What are you waiting for?
The closest to the phone picks it up.

357
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,893
Wow... You...

358
00:27:21,066 --> 00:27:25,530
You're as cheap as
this herring, you know?

359
00:27:28,288 --> 00:27:29,724
Yes.

360
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:33,349
<i>Am I speaking to
Hangang Construction?</i>

361
00:27:33,495 --> 00:27:35,446
That's right, how may I help you?

362
00:27:35,635 --> 00:27:39,944
<i>I'm Chairman Hwang Taeseop
of Manbo Construction.</i>

363
00:27:40,206 --> 00:27:43,047
<i>Gangmo... No...</i>

364
00:27:43,281 --> 00:27:46,353
<i>I'd like to speak with
President Lee Gangmo.</i>

365
00:27:47,372 --> 00:27:48,579
Hey...

366
00:27:49,148 --> 00:27:51,827
It's Chairman Hwang Taeseop?!

367
00:27:52,132 --> 00:27:52,994
What?

368
00:27:53,108 --> 00:27:54,588
He's asking for Gangmo.

369
00:27:54,684 --> 00:27:58,490
But Gangmo went to meet
Commissioner Han Myeongseok?!

370
00:27:58,742 --> 00:28:01,819
Our president right now
is meeting... Han...

371
00:28:01,965 --> 00:28:05,736
Han Something... Commissioner...
Right, he's meeting with this Han Something.

372
00:28:07,293 --> 00:28:09,812
How can you just tell him?

373
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:13,845
Then, could you convey a memo for me?

374
00:28:14,724 --> 00:28:16,952
Yangsuri...

375
00:28:17,131 --> 00:28:19,411
Next to the public cemetery.

376
00:28:19,515 --> 00:28:21,609
Tomorrow at 1 pm?

377
00:28:22,877 --> 00:28:26,413
I'll probably get to tell him
by the end of the day.

378
00:28:26,604 --> 00:28:29,254
Yes... Yes.

379
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:37,846
Why is he asking to meet Gangmo
at a public cemetery?

380
00:28:38,084 --> 00:28:39,816
Public...

381
00:28:40,763 --> 00:28:42,341
Got a point?!

382
00:28:42,447 --> 00:28:43,281
Wait a moment.

383
00:28:43,398 --> 00:28:48,395
So huge corporations even get involved
in the grave business, or something?

384
00:28:51,089 --> 00:28:54,248
I was wondering who could be owning
those mudflats in Gaepo-Dong,

385
00:28:54,436 --> 00:28:56,490
and it turns out to be you.

386
00:28:57,262 --> 00:29:01,076
So, what do you
plan to do with that land?

387
00:29:01,353 --> 00:29:05,580
I was thinking of building
apartment complexes there.

388
00:29:08,317 --> 00:29:11,258
The reason I asked to meet you today...

389
00:29:11,345 --> 00:29:15,524
I'm afraid I'll have to
deal with the check tonight.

390
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:20,343
Hangang Construction doesn't
have the qualifications.

391
00:29:20,561 --> 00:29:24,272
No matter how hard you try to convince me,
I can't issue you that permit.

392
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:28,864
I will use the construction
committee's joint liability.

393
00:29:29,432 --> 00:29:32,693
Did the committee
agree to give you that?

394
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:37,241
Should I get that,
would you issue that permit?

395
00:29:39,512 --> 00:29:43,530
You have more business savvy
than I imagined.

396
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:46,500
Then, how are you going to deal
with your nearly non-existent...

397
00:29:46,587 --> 00:29:49,791
track record with subcontractors?

398
00:29:50,052 --> 00:29:56,488
I'm negotiating with our country's
most efficient subcontractors as we speak.

399
00:29:59,982 --> 00:30:05,820
So can I deal with the check for tonight?

400
00:30:06,184 --> 00:30:09,095
I see you have quite the quick temper.

401
00:30:09,345 --> 00:30:12,548
So, what, do you want me
to make a decision right now?

402
00:30:12,754 --> 00:30:14,879
I'm fully confident I can build
apartments that will be stronger...

403
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:20,208
and of much better quality than
any of those big corporations.

404
00:30:27,473 --> 00:30:29,744
You have a guest.

405
00:30:30,429 --> 00:30:33,653
I'm Hwang Jeongyeon
of Manbo Construction.

406
00:30:34,243 --> 00:30:36,645
I'm talking with a guest,
send her back.

407
00:30:36,833 --> 00:30:41,901
<i>I won't move a finger
until you agree to meet me.</i>

408
00:30:42,937 --> 00:30:45,806
- Just a moment.
- Yes.

409
00:30:57,081 --> 00:30:59,455
How do you explain
such insulting behavior?

410
00:31:00,671 --> 00:31:03,291
I'm begging for your help, Commissioner.

411
00:31:03,859 --> 00:31:04,868
Look, Miss Jeongyeon...

412
00:31:04,975 --> 00:31:09,391
Save Manbo Construction.

413
00:31:10,381 --> 00:31:13,118
I'm afraid I don't have all that power.

414
00:31:13,336 --> 00:31:15,025
You looked for the wrong person.

415
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,814
Chairman Hwang Taeseop
has been misled into thinking...

416
00:31:18,936 --> 00:31:21,852
you were the first to act
against Manbo Construction.

417
00:31:22,172 --> 00:31:25,797
The one who used Jo Pilyeon
to put me in a difficult spot...

418
00:31:26,001 --> 00:31:27,399
was exactly Chairman Hwang Taeseop.

419
00:31:27,562 --> 00:31:29,844
We never did that.

420
00:31:30,856 --> 00:31:34,894
And if you ask me to stake my life
to prove those accusations wrong,

421
00:31:35,127 --> 00:31:38,723
I will be happy to.

422
00:31:42,246 --> 00:31:45,413
Have you asked yourself who could
be behind this misunderstanding?

423
00:31:46,097 --> 00:31:47,472
<i>The way I see it,</i>

424
00:31:47,583 --> 00:31:50,479
it could very well be the man who
would have most benefited from it,

425
00:31:51,062 --> 00:31:56,623
Hangang Construction's
President James Lee.

426
00:32:08,955 --> 00:32:10,819
Miss Jeongyeon.

427
00:32:11,212 --> 00:32:12,668
I suggest you leave.

428
00:32:12,916 --> 00:32:15,128
Let me clear this misunderstanding.

429
00:32:15,783 --> 00:32:19,433
I will soon contact you.
You may leave now.

430
00:32:42,481 --> 00:32:44,403
President Lee,

431
00:32:45,509 --> 00:32:51,334
I believe you might have
something to tell me?!

432
00:32:56,182 --> 00:33:01,394
I'll be expecting good news
concerning the construction permit.

433
00:33:03,476 --> 00:33:07,343
Bring me that joint
liability you promised.

434
00:33:07,702 --> 00:33:11,712
Although, if Miss Jeongyeon can have
any say in it, it might be difficult.

435
00:33:12,055 --> 00:33:14,137
All right.

436
00:33:34,126 --> 00:33:35,945
Daesoo.

437
00:33:36,557 --> 00:33:39,808
Looks like your son's not coming.

438
00:34:14,257 --> 00:34:15,638
<i>Jeongyeon...</i>

439
00:34:15,751 --> 00:34:18,159
<i>You have matured a lot.</i>

440
00:34:18,901 --> 00:34:21,828
<i>You now know how to drive,</i>

441
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:28,099
<i>and you've become much stronger...</i>

442
00:34:28,871 --> 00:34:31,957
<i>and more confident than ever.</i>

443
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:56,891
<i>- Lee Daesoo's Grave -</i>

444
00:34:56,982 --> 00:34:58,993
<i>Hey, Daesoo.</i>

445
00:34:59,122 --> 00:35:04,802
I really wanted your boy
to become my real son.

446
00:35:06,083 --> 00:35:10,014
How could one's destiny
be so wretched...

447
00:35:12,882 --> 00:35:18,089
You've been cursing at me from
up there all along, haven't you?

448
00:35:19,996 --> 00:35:24,830
I... even changed
my testament, you prick.

449
00:35:25,063 --> 00:35:29,969
I decided to give
half my entire assets...

450
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:33,151
to your son Gangmo.

451
00:35:35,524 --> 00:35:38,873
I know that won't
earn your forgiveness.

452
00:35:39,151 --> 00:35:42,658
Who ever asked you to
forgive me, you silly?

453
00:35:44,987 --> 00:35:48,999
I'm just giving back what was
yours from the very start.

454
00:35:51,911 --> 00:35:57,967
When I come next time,
I'll bring Gangmo with me.

455
00:36:03,179 --> 00:36:06,180
I'm sorry, Daesoo.

456
00:36:25,339 --> 00:36:27,493
Did they go belly-up, already?

457
00:36:27,668 --> 00:36:32,574
How could there be no one
in sight for half a day?

458
00:37:02,837 --> 00:37:06,481
Your palms don't really
suggest this line of work?!

459
00:37:06,569 --> 00:37:07,787
- Oppa.
- Yeah.

460
00:37:07,918 --> 00:37:10,536
Are you really Hangang
Construction's managing director?

461
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,764
Can't you read?
It's written there.

462
00:37:12,871 --> 00:37:15,664
"Managing Director Park Sotae."

463
00:37:16,435 --> 00:37:18,409
So how many employees do you have?

464
00:37:18,487 --> 00:37:19,801
Employees?

465
00:37:20,077 --> 00:37:21,591
Three...

466
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:23,513
Three minutes wouldn't
be enough to list them!

467
00:37:23,586 --> 00:37:25,201
Who can count all those people?

468
00:37:25,295 --> 00:37:26,427
You're so cool, Oppa...

469
00:37:26,514 --> 00:37:29,105
Hey, Park Sotae.

470
00:37:32,206 --> 00:37:34,769
And why would I run?

471
00:37:38,408 --> 00:37:39,005
Wow...

472
00:37:39,078 --> 00:37:40,991
You sure can be thick-headed.

473
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,223
I wonder what kind of brilliant idea
is behind you coming here looking for me.

474
00:37:43,325 --> 00:37:44,228
What?!

475
00:37:44,417 --> 00:37:45,800
You little twit, have a death wish?

476
00:37:45,887 --> 00:37:47,765
Be my guest. Hit me!

477
00:37:47,911 --> 00:37:50,610
I know Officer Kim down at
the station pretty well.

478
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:52,858
So hit me!

479
00:37:54,287 --> 00:37:55,598
Actually,

480
00:37:56,162 --> 00:37:58,411
I was here to do a
little negotiating with you.

481
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,847
Give me a break.

482
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:02,011
Negotiating... Yeah...

483
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:04,573
Negotiating what?

484
00:38:04,661 --> 00:38:08,169
You like money, don't you?

485
00:38:08,533 --> 00:38:09,363
I can give you money.

486
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,819
Give me land instead, you twat.

487
00:38:10,892 --> 00:38:12,508
Didn't you say I'd get some land
if I got rid of Lee Gangmo?

488
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:17,570
So... Did Lee Gangmo die?

489
00:38:18,545 --> 00:38:19,317
Of course.

490
00:38:19,491 --> 00:38:20,554
Did he make it, then?

491
00:38:20,685 --> 00:38:21,501
Did you see it?

492
00:38:21,646 --> 00:38:23,102
Have you seen
Lee Gangmo alive and well?

493
00:38:23,189 --> 00:38:24,529
Hey... Hey!

494
00:38:35,437 --> 00:38:37,140
<i>This is just a little appetizer.</i>

495
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,311
If you do as I say,

496
00:38:39,455 --> 00:38:41,522
<i>there'll be more where that came from.</i>

497
00:38:44,812 --> 00:38:48,048
Where is that president of yours?

498
00:38:49,022 --> 00:38:51,104
James Lee.

499
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:53,986
What is he really about?

500
00:38:54,307 --> 00:38:56,097
I'll bring him to you,

501
00:38:56,287 --> 00:38:58,330
so you can see for yourself.

502
00:38:58,470 --> 00:38:59,957
Really?

503
00:39:01,004 --> 00:39:02,508
Can you do that for me?

504
00:39:02,606 --> 00:39:04,417
I'm Park Sotae...

505
00:39:04,691 --> 00:39:06,336
When am I getting
the rest of the money?

506
00:39:06,475 --> 00:39:09,687
If you bring James Lee to me...

507
00:39:09,785 --> 00:39:11,824
Fine.

508
00:39:12,109 --> 00:39:15,493
Come to the construction
site at midnight.

509
00:39:15,697 --> 00:39:18,020
At... At midnight?!

510
00:39:18,783 --> 00:39:22,732
The president will come
at half past eleven.

511
00:39:23,713 --> 00:39:25,479
You...

512
00:39:26,053 --> 00:39:28,259
If you take that money and run away,

513
00:39:28,411 --> 00:39:31,157
you know it'll get
you killed, don't you?

514
00:39:32,016 --> 00:39:33,282
Am I out of my mind?

515
00:39:33,481 --> 00:39:37,927
Abandoning a stable job for
a pittance and running away.

516
00:39:39,295 --> 00:39:41,130
Let's get going.

517
00:39:42,242 --> 00:39:45,264
You people, really...

518
00:39:48,351 --> 00:39:49,217
What?!

519
00:39:49,414 --> 00:39:51,918
So that is who Hwang Jeongshik was?

520
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:53,229
I told you.

521
00:39:53,331 --> 00:39:55,820
Because of that prick,
Gangmo was framed for murder,

522
00:39:55,907 --> 00:39:57,902
and was even taken
to the Samcheong camp.

523
00:39:58,047 --> 00:40:01,192
Anyhow, he's the worst thing
that happened to us.

524
00:40:01,338 --> 00:40:04,089
Wow...
That motherless son of a tramp...

525
00:40:04,206 --> 00:40:07,034
So, you'll help us, right?

526
00:40:07,263 --> 00:40:08,949
Let's see the money first.

527
00:40:09,619 --> 00:40:12,021
I told you we'd share it
when it's all said and done!

528
00:40:12,182 --> 00:40:13,637
Fine.

529
00:40:14,059 --> 00:40:15,719
What are you going to do?

530
00:40:16,098 --> 00:40:17,102
What do you think?

531
00:40:17,262 --> 00:40:19,527
Anything that happens
on a construction site...

532
00:40:19,643 --> 00:40:23,333
should be dealt with
the construction-site way.

533
00:40:23,681 --> 00:40:26,789
Construction-site way...

534
00:40:28,094 --> 00:40:31,999
Ahh... Where am I supposed to go?

535
00:40:32,756 --> 00:40:35,645
I can't see a thing in here.

536
00:40:39,758 --> 00:40:41,001
It's here.

537
00:40:41,129 --> 00:40:42,278
Come.

538
00:40:42,469 --> 00:40:44,664
Ehh... You really...

539
00:40:44,886 --> 00:40:47,906
What are you, meeting a spy?

540
00:40:48,088 --> 00:40:51,324
<i>Always acting like trash, aren't you?</i>

541
00:41:05,978 --> 00:41:07,845
Hey... Park Sotae!

542
00:41:08,511 --> 00:41:10,283
Wanna die?

543
00:41:10,535 --> 00:41:11,728
Die?

544
00:41:11,932 --> 00:41:13,304
Who?

545
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:14,288
Me?!

546
00:41:14,375 --> 00:41:15,957
You bastard...

547
00:41:16,136 --> 00:41:18,044
If you leave me here, you're dead!

548
00:41:18,175 --> 00:41:20,489
You prick!

549
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:26,444
Action!

550
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,247
Hey... Hey! Park Sotae!

551
00:41:33,306 --> 00:41:35,957
What the hell are you doing?

552
00:41:42,854 --> 00:41:45,673
Hey... Hey... Park Sotae...

553
00:41:50,025 --> 00:41:51,408
Spare me... Spare my life...

554
00:41:51,481 --> 00:41:54,085
Cut!

555
00:41:56,154 --> 00:41:59,488
Said the same thing
many times, deep down.

556
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:01,526
"Please, spare me."

557
00:42:01,614 --> 00:42:04,912
Sotae... Sotae... Sotae!

558
00:42:05,203 --> 00:42:06,368
Scared, aren't you?

559
00:42:06,484 --> 00:42:07,911
A little angry as well.

560
00:42:08,115 --> 00:42:15,204
But I was a hundred times angrier
and more scared than you.

561
00:42:16,398 --> 00:42:18,722
Action!

562
00:42:25,062 --> 00:42:27,809
Sotae...

563
00:42:28,088 --> 00:42:32,901
Burying you would be a waste of
perfectly good land, you prick.

564
00:42:33,017 --> 00:42:35,458
<i>Sotae...</i>

565
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:45,817
You fool.

566
00:42:45,989 --> 00:42:48,478
Shouldn't you at least
send me a signal to stop?

567
00:42:48,624 --> 00:42:51,471
Are you really going to bury him?

568
00:42:52,068 --> 00:42:52,913
Please, spare me.

569
00:42:52,985 --> 00:42:55,475
I beg you... Spare me...

570
00:42:55,781 --> 00:43:02,128
He looks like an annoying twat,
just like you said.

571
00:43:05,462 --> 00:43:06,781
Don't cry.

572
00:43:06,991 --> 00:43:09,978
Will that bring back
the love long gone by?

573
00:43:14,229 --> 00:43:17,170
Hand me the rest of my money.

574
00:43:18,043 --> 00:43:22,556
You said you'd give it to me
if I brought you James Lee.

575
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:26,065
I'm James Lee.

576
00:43:27,139 --> 00:43:28,508
How do you do?

577
00:43:28,667 --> 00:43:31,382
Don't you even understand
"How do you do"?

578
00:43:31,474 --> 00:43:33,312
<i>How do you do.</i>

579
00:43:33,486 --> 00:43:36,471
He's asking how many
yoodoo (nipples) you have.

580
00:43:36,645 --> 00:43:38,043
<i>Uh?</i>

581
00:43:49,583 --> 00:43:53,936
Back where you were.
Quick.

582
00:43:55,363 --> 00:43:56,489
Shall we go?

583
00:43:56,589 --> 00:43:58,028
President James Lee.

584
00:43:58,174 --> 00:44:00,071
Yeah!

585
00:44:01,187 --> 00:44:02,177

Sotae!

590
00:44:10,344 --> 00:44:12,810
Get me out of here first!

591
00:44:20,055 --> 00:44:22,224
Nah...

592
00:44:32,026 --> 00:44:33,733
I apologize.

593
00:44:33,867 --> 00:44:36,306
- Why?
- They're so expensive...

594
00:44:36,437 --> 00:44:39,538
How about these?

595
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:32,417
Our Miju looks like a princess?!

596
00:45:32,883 --> 00:45:35,705
If I'm a princess, what are you?

597
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:39,461
We're just... your guards, I guess?

598
00:45:39,763 --> 00:45:42,111
If anyone bothers you, just tell us.

599
00:45:42,212 --> 00:45:44,194
We'll scold him for you.

600
00:45:44,396 --> 00:45:47,766
People will be so scared of you,
I'll never get to marry.

601
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:52,596
Of course!
Whoever it is, better watch out.

602
00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:05,959
If I'm a princess, then I guess
I'll just have to meet my prince.

603
00:46:06,178 --> 00:46:07,997
By any chance...

604
00:46:08,244 --> 00:46:09,964
Are we dating someone?

00:46:10,181 --> 00:46:11,243
Uh?!

606
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:12,772

607
00:46:12,918 --> 00:46:14,818
You're really dating?

608
00:46:15,029 --> 00:46:17,515
What time is it?
I had to go somewhere...

609
00:46:17,944 --> 00:46:19,556
With whom?

610
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:22,158
Sorry, I'll get going.

611
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:23,643
Hey...

612
00:46:24,779 --> 00:46:28,346
Is she really dating, or what?

613
00:46:28,986 --> 00:46:31,156
She had it so hard all this time.

614
00:46:31,447 --> 00:46:34,140
She deserves to do
what everyone else does now.

Let's go to the hospital, uh?

621
00:47:03,116 --> 00:47:04,773
The hospital, for so little?

622
00:47:04,866 --> 00:47:06,202
Just a band-aid and...

623
00:47:06,333 --> 00:47:07,163
Get on my back.

624
00:47:07,279 --> 00:47:10,778

Is that the problem now?

627
00:47:17,405 --> 00:47:19,126
Blood is gushing out of there!

628
00:47:19,212 --> 00:47:21,206
Gushing?!
I said I'm all right!

629
00:47:21,308 --> 00:47:22,773
Just stay put.

630
00:47:26,991 --> 00:47:29,263
I thought I'd die of
embarrassment in there.

631
00:47:29,369 --> 00:47:34,488
Just a band-aid and that'll do,
need to turn the hospital upside down?

632
00:47:35,148 --> 00:47:36,585
Hey...

633
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:40,311
There is such a thing as tetanus.

00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:35,559
<i>Dearest Congressman Park Yongseon.</i>

650
00:50:35,784 --> 00:50:40,112
<i>I always deeply respected you,
but we never had the chance to meet.</i>

651
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:43,140
<i>What I need now is an ally.</i>

652
00:50:43,403 --> 00:50:46,969
<i>Whether you and I
become allies of a lifetime,</i>

653
00:50:47,158 --> 00:50:51,366
<i>or you refuse to form ties with me
and turn ourselves against each other,</i>

654
00:50:51,613 --> 00:50:54,802
<i>that solely depends on you.</i>

655
00:51:44,043 --> 00:51:48,032
<i>- Min Honggi wins Gangnam By-Elections
by Landslide Margin! -</i>

656
00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:03,636
Thank you, I appreciate it.

657
00:52:03,850 --> 00:52:06,500
Let's have dinner together,
one of these days.

658
00:52:06,674 --> 00:52:07,810
Yes, thank you again.

659
00:52:07,897 --> 00:52:09,610
<i>Congressman.</i>

660
00:52:09,688 --> 00:52:11,472
Congratulations on your victory.

661
00:52:11,564 --> 00:52:14,711
- Congratulations.
- My congratulations.

662
00:52:15,744 --> 00:52:17,271
Congratulations, Congressman.

663
00:52:17,373 --> 00:52:19,149
Yes.

664
00:52:21,391 --> 00:52:22,162
Have a seat.

665
00:52:22,293 --> 00:52:24,200
- Yes.
- Yes.

666
00:52:28,408 --> 00:52:32,549
So the committee is
officially supporting me...

667
00:52:32,709 --> 00:52:34,907
I must thank you all.

668
00:52:35,399 --> 00:52:38,882
But I don't see
Chairman Hwang Taeseop?!

669
00:52:39,056 --> 00:52:45,200
Don't you know how close to
Jo Pilyeon he's always been?

670
00:52:45,418 --> 00:52:47,515
Try to be understanding.

671
00:52:54,663 --> 00:52:57,751
Hwang Taeseop is
still supporting Jo Pilyeon.

672
00:52:57,859 --> 00:53:05,882
Whatever the occasion, you must always
pretend you two are on good terms.

673
00:53:06,367 --> 00:53:11,186
You also should let people believe
Hwang was behind the committee's support.

674
00:53:12,773 --> 00:53:16,631
So we'll create a rift
between him and Jo Pilyeon?

675
00:53:16,791 --> 00:53:22,697
Or if Jo Pilyeon ends up
getting rid of him, all the better.

676
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:26,569
As long as Hwang Taeseop
keeps going strong,

677
00:53:26,788 --> 00:53:30,034
Jo Pilyeon will always get
a chance to get back on his feet.

678
00:53:30,806 --> 00:53:33,582
Getting rid of our problems
at the very root...

679
00:53:34,387 --> 00:53:37,070
Have any idea how to do it?

680
00:53:45,863 --> 00:53:49,646
Looks like you're busy, these days.

681
00:53:49,823 --> 00:53:53,674
I was about to start feeling disappointed,
always waiting for you in vain?

682
00:53:53,765 --> 00:53:55,422
Forgive me.

683
00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:58,472
But you look good.

684
00:53:58,589 --> 00:54:01,158
There's nothing I
can complain about here.

685
00:54:01,289 --> 00:54:05,249
Your environment is only as bad
as you make it out to be, isn't it?

686
00:54:06,123 --> 00:54:10,003
The construction committee
started supporting Min Honggi.

687
00:54:14,513 --> 00:54:15,901
Is that true?

688
00:54:16,012 --> 00:54:20,468
Even when you're released,
getting back on your feet won't be easy.

689
00:54:20,904 --> 00:54:22,263
Who's behind this?

690
00:54:22,535 --> 00:54:23,933
Was it Hwang Taeseop?

691
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:28,841
Since Chairman Hwang
leads the committee.

692
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:36,673
So I see there was a reason why
he kept avoiding me all this time.

693
00:54:38,144 --> 00:54:42,678
Jaechun, you go tell Hwang Taeseop
I want to meet him.

694
00:54:42,882 --> 00:54:44,325
All right.

695
00:54:46,288 --> 00:54:50,109
People only show their true colors
when the going gets rough.

696
00:54:50,219 --> 00:54:57,163
Hwang Taeseop kept betraying me
whenever I faced problems.

697
00:54:57,469 --> 00:55:01,365
<i>If this turns out to be
his latest act of betrayal,</i>

698
00:55:01,555 --> 00:55:06,634
I'm afraid I'll find it hard to
keep forgiving him any longer.

699
00:55:15,531 --> 00:55:17,426
You have a guest.

700
00:55:17,831 --> 00:55:19,811
Who is it?

701
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:28,415
What brings you here?

702
00:55:28,619 --> 00:55:32,636
Director Jo would like to meet you.

703
00:55:33,801 --> 00:55:35,256
All the better.

704
00:55:35,417 --> 00:55:39,609
I was thinking of
paying him a visit myself.

705
00:55:54,258 --> 00:55:56,297
I'd like a more comfortable setting,

706
00:55:56,442 --> 00:55:58,626
I trust you won't mind?

707
00:56:03,765 --> 00:56:07,450
So the committee decided to pledge
their support for Min Honggi?

708
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:09,153
Is that so?

709
00:56:09,407 --> 00:56:11,410
Why, you weren't aware?

710
00:56:11,759 --> 00:56:16,214
Don't you think that
was a foregone conclusion?

711
00:56:16,622 --> 00:56:17,535
What?

712
00:56:17,772 --> 00:56:20,157
I'm afraid businessmen like us...

713
00:56:20,266 --> 00:56:24,930
can't afford to wait for
a failure to redeem himself.

714
00:56:25,267 --> 00:56:28,528
Did I just hear "failure"?

715
00:56:28,703 --> 00:56:32,352
Clouds only gather up high.

716
00:56:32,648 --> 00:56:34,334
Same goes for money.

717
00:56:34,773 --> 00:56:37,609
Who would ever invest money
in a losing team?

718
00:56:37,709 --> 00:56:39,272
Look, Chairman Hwang!

719
00:56:39,389 --> 00:56:46,260
I don't have any more money
to throw at you, either.

720
00:56:47,003 --> 00:56:52,604
And that's because it took half my assets
to make up for the sins you made me commit.

721
00:56:52,866 --> 00:56:54,584
What are you talking about?

722
00:56:54,890 --> 00:56:57,017
The sins I made you commit?!

723
00:56:57,141 --> 00:56:59,651
That friend of mine you killed,

724
00:57:00,218 --> 00:57:02,038
Lee Daesoo.

725
00:57:02,431 --> 00:57:05,008
His son has shown up.

726
00:57:07,046 --> 00:57:12,295
So I'll take this opportunity
to atone for all my sins.

727
00:57:12,554 --> 00:57:19,385
That can only mean these wretched ties
of ours will finally have to be cut.

728
00:57:20,622 --> 00:57:24,757
And who is this son
you're talking about?

729
00:57:25,048 --> 00:57:29,497
Why, suspecting a
possible retaliation,

730
00:57:30,182 --> 00:57:32,686
are you by any chance afraid?

731
00:57:33,384 --> 00:57:35,240
I'm asking you who he is.

732
00:57:35,437 --> 00:57:38,087
Or maybe, just like
you did with my friend,

733
00:57:38,276 --> 00:57:41,701
will you get rid of
his son the same way?

734
00:57:41,807 --> 00:57:44,167
Hey... Hwang Taeseop!

735
00:57:44,917 --> 00:57:47,100
Jo Pilyeon.

736
00:57:47,654 --> 00:57:55,116
I see no reason why I should
continue letting you walk all over me!

737
00:57:59,144 --> 00:58:02,944
Past, present or future,

738
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:05,491
I won't ever kneel down before you,

739
00:58:05,666 --> 00:58:08,252
nor will I lose something
just for your sake.

740
00:58:08,359 --> 00:58:09,539
Are we clear,

741
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:11,562
Jo Pilyeon?

742
00:58:14,081 --> 00:58:19,349
You're always welcome to try me,

743
00:58:20,266 --> 00:58:23,964
so do as you please.

744
00:58:28,433 --> 00:58:29,627
Ahh...

745
00:58:29,833 --> 00:58:31,476
Also,

746
00:58:31,859 --> 00:58:34,344
allow me to let you in on something.

747
00:58:36,528 --> 00:58:41,478
The fact I could be as
cruel as you, and more.

748
00:58:47,586 --> 00:58:49,580
Cruel?

749
00:58:51,662 --> 00:58:54,516
Even more cruel than me?

750
00:58:57,136 --> 00:58:58,534
Sure...

751
00:58:58,956 --> 00:59:06,164
I'll make you feel what
being cruel really means.

752
00:59:27,723 --> 00:59:28,902
Yes?

753
00:59:29,135 --> 00:59:32,673
<i>Why was it so hard to reach
you these last few days?</i>

754
00:59:34,507 --> 00:59:36,420
I was busy here and there.

755
00:59:36,853 --> 00:59:39,346
Why, anything urgent?

756
00:59:39,539 --> 00:59:43,122
<i>Hwang Taeseop called
several times looking for you.</i>

757
00:59:43,379 --> 00:59:46,913
<i>Said it's important,
so you should call him.</i>

758
00:59:48,867 --> 00:59:50,755
All right.

759
01:00:06,459 --> 01:00:07,937
Yes.

760
01:00:08,476 --> 01:00:09,844
<i>It's me.</i>

761
01:00:10,368 --> 01:00:14,416
Right...
I was waiting for your call.

762
01:00:14,881 --> 01:00:16,803
<i>What is the matter?</i>

763
01:00:17,516 --> 01:00:20,399
I need to go somewhere with you.

764
01:00:20,574 --> 01:00:24,695
You'll also get to meet
a very welcome person.

765
01:00:25,117 --> 01:00:27,271
<i>Who would that be?</i>

766
01:00:28,698 --> 01:00:32,309
Before that, I also need
to give you something,

767
01:00:32,454 --> 01:00:34,798
so I'd like to meet.

768
01:00:36,050 --> 01:00:40,580
Tonight at midnight
by my house would be fine.

769
01:00:40,755 --> 01:00:42,560
Dad.

770
01:00:44,278 --> 01:00:45,542
All right.

771
01:00:45,705 --> 01:00:48,078
We'll meet there, then.

772
01:00:50,553 --> 01:00:52,886
Who called?

773
01:00:54,076 --> 01:00:56,056
It's nothing.

774
01:00:56,862 --> 01:00:59,740
Commissioner Han Myeongseok called.

775
01:00:59,949 --> 01:01:03,006
He wanted to meet you later tonight.

776
01:01:03,515 --> 01:01:04,960
Han Myeongseok? Why?

777
01:01:05,075 --> 01:01:07,239
It'll probably be about
Hangang Construction.

778
01:01:07,350 --> 01:01:08,771
And James Lee as well.

779
01:01:08,931 --> 01:01:13,001
I told you to stop concerning
yourself with Hangang Construction.

780
01:01:13,210 --> 01:01:14,652
Dad.

781
01:01:15,584 --> 01:01:18,117
Postpone my meeting
with him to tomorrow.

782
01:01:18,439 --> 01:01:20,723
I have other plans tonight.

783
01:01:20,999 --> 01:01:24,916
There is nothing more important to us
than meeting Commissioner Han.

784
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:26,459
Jeongyeon!

785
01:01:26,648 --> 01:01:30,328
You met that James Lee, didn't you?

786
01:01:30,813 --> 01:01:32,895
Who is he?

787
01:01:33,754 --> 01:01:35,178
You can leave.

788
01:01:35,413 --> 01:01:36,863
Dad...

789
01:01:37,175 --> 01:01:39,315
I said leave!

790
01:01:55,529 --> 01:01:59,285
I think that, after letting
Hwang Taeseop take care of it,

791
01:01:59,445 --> 01:02:03,120
it's time we get our
Manbo Construction back.

792
01:02:03,353 --> 01:02:07,779
I'm well aware of what you're implying.

793
01:02:08,434 --> 01:02:11,259
There must be no mistakes.

794
01:02:11,739 --> 01:02:13,573
All right.

795
01:02:20,493 --> 01:02:23,056
Thanks, Jaechun.

796
01:02:28,049 --> 01:02:30,335
Director.

797
01:02:35,516 --> 01:02:38,530
Even when forced into
this pathetic state,

798
01:02:38,879 --> 01:02:44,601
I still feel you're
the only one I can trust.

799
01:03:06,967 --> 01:03:10,319
I'll go take a walk before I come in.

800
01:03:10,429 --> 01:03:12,845
By yourself?!
Let me accompany you.

801
01:03:12,954 --> 01:03:14,561
No need.

802
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:18,454
I just want to
spend some time alone.

803
01:04:14,908 --> 01:04:17,601
Who are you? Chairman!

804
01:04:29,585 --> 01:04:30,371
Wake up!

805
01:04:30,531 --> 01:04:32,089
Chairman!

806
01:04:37,257 --> 01:04:39,271
Chairman! Wake up...

807
01:04:39,412 --> 01:04:42,018
Chairman... Chairman!!

808
01:04:42,203 --> 01:04:45,307
Brought to you by WITH S2
