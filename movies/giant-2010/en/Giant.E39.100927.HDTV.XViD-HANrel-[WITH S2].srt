00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,001
<i>Sir.</i>

5
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:29,182
<i>Aren't you sleeping yet?</i>

6
00:00:29,263 --> 00:00:30,842
No need to come in.

7
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:33,223
Go have some rest.

8
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:00,331
I'm Han Sojin.

9
00:01:06,055 --> 00:01:08,021
<i>- Taeyang Trading CEO-
HAN Sojin</i>

10
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,201
I'm Lee Gangmo.

11
00:01:15,387 --> 00:01:18,111
So you run Hangang Construction?!

12
00:01:19,732 --> 00:01:22,432
But what's your relation with her?

13
00:01:22,937 --> 00:01:25,732
I don't think
that's any of your business?

14
00:01:25,826 --> 00:01:29,550
Ahh... Again being snarky.

15
00:01:29,904 --> 00:01:32,627
- Let me pour you one.
- No thanks.

16
00:01:32,886 --> 00:01:35,147
I need to go.

17
00:01:37,223 --> 00:01:38,851
<i>How much is it?</i>

18
00:01:39,156 --> 00:01:41,059
2,000 won.

19
00:01:42,539 --> 00:01:44,324
Thank you.

20
00:01:48,754 --> 00:01:52,171
I wanted a word with you.

21
00:01:52,894 --> 00:01:56,141
If it's regarding the loan,
you can look for me at the office.

22
00:02:13,839 --> 00:02:15,260
You're still here?

23
00:02:16,364 --> 00:02:17,817
Had a few things to take care of.

24
00:02:17,911 --> 00:02:19,642
All the better.

25
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,014
I need a favor.

26
00:02:23,417 --> 00:02:26,618
Dig into this fella for me.

27
00:02:27,277 --> 00:02:29,304
<i>Han... So...jin...</i>

28
00:02:29,485 --> 00:02:30,460
And who is he?

29
00:02:30,566 --> 00:02:33,033
He's been approaching
Jeongyeon for a while.

30
00:02:33,128 --> 00:02:34,137
What?!

31
00:02:35,607 --> 00:02:39,412
Jeongyeon doesn't really understand men.

32
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:42,514
If he was a decent man,
I could understand.

33
00:02:43,054 --> 00:02:44,781
But he just strikes me the wrong way.

34
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:49,620
And if he really is a decent person...
Think that'll make any difference to you?

35
00:02:50,431 --> 00:02:52,387
I'll be counting on you, Shideok.

36
00:03:07,042 --> 00:03:08,587
Ever since you were little,

37
00:03:08,722 --> 00:03:10,883
you always liked fish cake.

38
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:31,687
You're back, Hyungnim?

39
00:03:32,074 --> 00:03:33,419
Look into this Lee Gangmo.

40
00:03:33,501 --> 00:03:35,134
I have a bad feeling about him.

41
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:36,579
Yes, Hyungnim.

42
00:03:37,074 --> 00:03:38,669
So according to the doctor,

43
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:42,076
Baekpa only has three months at best?

44
00:03:42,217 --> 00:03:43,191
Yes.

45
00:03:44,443 --> 00:03:47,191
This should end with a blitzkrieg...

46
00:03:47,767 --> 00:03:52,114
But that Hwang Jeongyeon
is just as bothersome as her mother.

47
00:03:54,064 --> 00:03:56,389
That half-brother of hers.

48
00:03:56,485 --> 00:03:58,322
Was it Hwang Jeongshik?!

49
00:03:58,507 --> 00:04:00,041
Is he gambling at our joint again?

50
00:04:00,133 --> 00:04:01,726
Yes, Hyungnim.

51
00:04:09,255 --> 00:04:10,239
What?!

52
00:04:10,364 --> 00:04:13,380
Has Minwoo really become that arrogant?

53
00:04:13,991 --> 00:04:20,052
Ever since becoming chairman he's been
acting so haughty, I can't take it anymore.

54
00:04:21,157 --> 00:04:23,670
Prick's grown some balls?!

55
00:04:23,766 --> 00:04:27,723
He should remember when he
was groveling at my father's feet.

56
00:04:27,838 --> 00:04:29,454
I really...

57
00:04:32,454 --> 00:04:35,358
Ohh... Bravo!!

58
00:04:37,336 --> 00:04:38,661
See?

59
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:43,107
If I'm the one calling
Jo Minwoo, he'll come.

60
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,934
<i>Here, a hundred thousand each.</i>

61
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:50,674
We made a bet!
Let's see my money.

62
00:04:51,942 --> 00:04:53,011
<i>Thank you, thank you.</i>

63
00:04:53,082 --> 00:04:54,327
Thanks.

64
00:04:54,421 --> 00:04:57,590
I'll spend them wisely.
Aww... Thank you!

65
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,754
Hey, Hwang Jeongshik.

66
00:05:00,165 --> 00:05:03,308
You said it was important,
what the hell is all this?

67
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:06,055
Minwoo.

68
00:05:06,151 --> 00:05:09,788
We're best of friends, aren't we?

69
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,205
What?!

70
00:05:11,792 --> 00:05:13,542
Give me some money.

71
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,786
Or if you really don't want to,

72
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:19,781
you could let me win every penny
you have at the poker table?!

73
00:05:23,551 --> 00:05:24,901
You...

74
00:05:25,524 --> 00:05:28,182
Waste my time with this bullshit again,

75
00:05:29,065 --> 00:05:31,212
and I won't let it fly next time.

76
00:05:32,681 --> 00:05:35,265
And if you won't let it fly, then what?!

77
00:05:35,664 --> 00:05:37,208
You little prick...

78
00:05:37,313 --> 00:05:40,515
You were nothing but a
salaryman until yesterday...

79
00:05:55,965 --> 00:05:57,327
So, what,

80
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,029
you think I'm an idiot?

81
00:06:01,623 --> 00:06:03,708
You better watch out, too.

82
00:06:03,804 --> 00:06:06,632
This prick is no friend of ours.

83
00:06:06,754 --> 00:06:10,410
You might end up in
my same situation, so...

84
00:06:12,888 --> 00:06:14,789
Jeongshik!

85
00:06:15,778 --> 00:06:17,685
Hey, you.

86
00:06:17,986 --> 00:06:21,337
Don't ever gamble with him again,
is that clear?

87
00:06:39,321 --> 00:06:41,773
Let's look where we're going, shall we?

88
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:42,998
What?

89
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:45,430
You little...

90
00:06:47,191 --> 00:06:49,000
I apologize.

91
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,606
Hyungnim.

92
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:02,069
Who could he possibly be...

93
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,550
Jo Minwoo.

94
00:07:03,648 --> 00:07:05,548
Chairman of Manbo Construction.

95
00:07:05,661 --> 00:07:06,939
What?!

96
00:07:07,046 --> 00:07:10,033
So young and he's already chairman?

97
00:07:10,127 --> 00:07:12,442
That's not what matters.

98
00:07:13,428 --> 00:07:18,080
It's the fact that Congressman
Jo Pilyeon is his father that does.

99
00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:21,551
Chairman Jo?

100
00:07:24,445 --> 00:07:27,111
Let me apologize again.

101
00:07:31,246 --> 00:07:33,102
<i>- CHA Bucheol -</i>

102
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,207
What's with you?

103
00:07:39,322 --> 00:07:43,149
You may end up facing some touchy
situations while doing business.

104
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:44,936
Call me anytime.

105
00:07:45,056 --> 00:07:47,659
Whatever the problem,
I can solve it for you.

106
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:15,321
Without money, this is useless.

107
00:08:15,861 --> 00:08:18,971
President Lee.
Have you seen today's paper?

108
00:08:19,622 --> 00:08:20,315
What's the matter?

109
00:08:20,373 --> 00:08:22,620
Take a look at this.

110
00:08:23,498 --> 00:08:26,481
<i>{\a6}- France Beaute Boilers
To Sell Korean Subsidiary -</i>

111
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,481
Looks like those French folks
are selling this?!

112
00:08:26,587 --> 00:08:28,314
It's a gas boiler company?!

113
00:08:28,443 --> 00:08:32,136
From now on, gas boilers
will dominate the market.

114
00:08:32,242 --> 00:08:37,501
If we equip our apartments with
one of these, it's game over.

115
00:08:40,343 --> 00:08:43,310
Why, we don't have the money?

116
00:08:43,776 --> 00:08:46,929
I made a few rough calculations,

117
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:49,473
- and 12 billion or so would do?!
- Aigoo...

118
00:08:49,637 --> 00:08:52,405
Is 12 billion pocket money?

119
00:08:52,511 --> 00:08:55,490
We can't afford to
invest such figures right now.

120
00:08:55,572 --> 00:08:57,510
<i>This could seriously make a mark...</i>

121
00:08:57,557 --> 00:08:59,718
Then why don't you make one by yourself?

122
00:08:59,765 --> 00:09:01,492
You always brag about
being able to build anything.

123
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:04,264
Keep prattling, you sorry-ass twat...

124
00:09:04,323 --> 00:09:08,258
<i>I mean, where would
you find 12 billion won?!</i>

125
00:09:12,914 --> 00:09:16,156
Beaute announced that they
will sell their Korean subsidiary.

126
00:09:16,367 --> 00:09:19,018
Are you planning to acquire it?

127
00:09:19,738 --> 00:09:23,199
If we install such gas boilers
in our apartments,

128
00:09:23,351 --> 00:09:26,274
nobody will be able to compete with us.

129
00:09:26,403 --> 00:09:27,895
Chairman.

130
00:09:28,205 --> 00:09:31,983
We had to suffer heavy losses
because of all the aggregate we bought.

131
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:36,810
If we continue expanding so recklessly,
we'll only bring more losses upon ourselves.

132
00:09:36,952 --> 00:09:41,014
Don't you realize that aggressive
investment is the only way to survive?

133
00:09:42,964 --> 00:09:46,529
Director Moon, form a project team
to decide on our bidding price.

134
00:09:46,638 --> 00:09:48,887
Certainly, Chairman.

135
00:09:51,928 --> 00:09:53,221
Just as the board
of directors suggested,

136
00:09:53,315 --> 00:09:55,799
our cash flow is a
cause for concern indeed.

137
00:09:55,924 --> 00:09:59,370
Get back all the money we loaned
to small and medium-sized firms.

138
00:09:59,461 --> 00:10:00,761
What?!

139
00:10:00,855 --> 00:10:03,096
You're going to take it back already?

140
00:10:03,178 --> 00:10:04,447
It was at zero interest, wasn't it?

141
00:10:04,552 --> 00:10:06,984
There were no repayment terms
listed in the contract.

142
00:10:07,414 --> 00:10:10,954
You must do everything to get that
money back before our Beaute acquisition.

143
00:10:11,048 --> 00:10:15,182
Even the banks have resigned
themselves regarding their debts.

144
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:21,578
I think the best way to deal with this
would be letting a pro handle it.

145
00:10:22,032 --> 00:10:23,997
A pro?!

146
00:10:25,638 --> 00:10:28,661
How about we entrust it to him?

147
00:10:32,338 --> 00:10:35,168
<i>- CHA Bucheol -</i>

148
00:10:41,189 --> 00:10:43,304
Ehh... That's not the right posture.

149
00:10:43,398 --> 00:10:44,628
Put it down.

150
00:10:44,707 --> 00:10:46,405
Right, don't just push up.

151
00:10:46,499 --> 00:10:48,813
Down, and then up.

152
00:10:48,918 --> 00:10:50,624
<i>That's right.</i>

153
00:10:50,728 --> 00:10:52,464
And now you go back down.

154
00:10:52,554 --> 00:10:55,259
That's right, good.

155
00:10:57,409 --> 00:11:03,024
Looks like that Han Sojin owns quite
the significant share of real estate abroad.

156
00:11:03,236 --> 00:11:08,901
<i>His credit rating is fine,
and Jeongyeon seems to trust him.</i>

157
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:32,584
Can I have the
installment for Jeongyeon?

158
00:11:34,796 --> 00:11:37,214
Pay back the entire sum.

159
00:11:37,439 --> 00:11:39,307
Oppa...

160
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:41,755
No need for installments now.

161
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:45,903
And you can stop conveying to me
news about her as well.

162
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:49,664
Can I really do that?

163
00:11:50,592 --> 00:11:52,460
That'd be all.

164
00:11:53,235 --> 00:11:56,650
Oppa... Then, come to me. Uh?

165
00:11:56,744 --> 00:11:59,179
I'll make you happy.

166
00:12:01,277 --> 00:12:04,562
I've only had eyes for you all this time.

167
00:12:04,719 --> 00:12:09,613
I never liked anyone other than you.

168
00:12:10,627 --> 00:12:12,247
Gyeongja...

169
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:14,964
I know...

170
00:12:15,053 --> 00:12:16,933
That it won't work.

171
00:12:17,442 --> 00:12:18,824
Still,

172
00:12:19,257 --> 00:12:24,439
at least once, I wanted to tell you that.

173
00:12:40,132 --> 00:12:42,079
I found Miju!

174
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:44,197
Where is she now?

175
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:47,603
An employee at a shoe store in
Hannam-Dong goes by the name Lee Miju.

176
00:12:47,673 --> 00:12:49,200
It's legit.

177
00:12:55,846 --> 00:12:58,165
How do they feel? Do they fit?

178
00:12:58,263 --> 00:13:00,912
- I'll take these.
- Yes.

179
00:13:05,216 --> 00:13:06,190
Come on in.

180
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,776
Do you have anything particular in mind?

181
00:13:07,846 --> 00:13:10,207
Sorry to interrupt,
but I need to ask you something.

182
00:13:10,301 --> 00:13:12,709
Is there a Lee Miju working here?

183
00:13:14,248 --> 00:13:17,135
Don't take that the wrong way,
I'm actually her brother.

184
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,818
There is no Lee Miju here?!

185
00:13:21,103 --> 00:13:25,281
Ahh... I did hear one of our
former employees was a certain Lee Miju.

186
00:13:25,391 --> 00:13:27,337
When did she quit?

187
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:28,891
It's been quite a while, I think?

188
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:31,064
And you don't know where she is now?

189
00:13:31,287 --> 00:13:32,496
I'm sorry.

190
00:13:32,602 --> 00:13:35,726
Just a moment.

191
00:13:37,042 --> 00:13:38,757
You can reach me here.

192
00:13:39,957 --> 00:13:43,810
Should you find anything about her,
please give me a call.

193
00:13:44,278 --> 00:13:45,737
Yes...

194
00:14:02,951 --> 00:14:04,760
It's me, Ma'am.

195
00:14:04,971 --> 00:14:08,284
Someone looking for Miju just came.

196
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:20,200
Looks like she went into hiding again,
knowing we were looking for her?!

197
00:14:23,713 --> 00:14:24,982
Miju...

198
00:14:25,076 --> 00:14:27,084
You really...

199
00:14:49,238 --> 00:14:51,915
I told you not to eat that way, didn't I?

200
00:14:52,221 --> 00:14:54,194
It's frivolous.

201
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:58,282
Did you really pay any attention
during those etiquette lessons?

202
00:15:00,419 --> 00:15:02,593
There is such a thing as grace,

203
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:06,211
the most evident example
of which are your table manners.

204
00:15:06,693 --> 00:15:10,827
How many times do I have to tell you
that once you become a star,

205
00:15:11,004 --> 00:15:13,318
your every action will be scrutinized?

206
00:15:13,776 --> 00:15:15,538
I apologize...

207
00:15:17,631 --> 00:15:19,314
I'll have to replace that teacher.

208
00:15:19,422 --> 00:15:20,791
Director...

209
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,845
My teacher didn't do anything wrong.

210
00:15:26,582 --> 00:15:30,805
And didn't I tell you to keep your feelings
to yourself, or any mystery will be lost?

211
00:15:32,525 --> 00:15:33,244
Yes...

212
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:36,800
Don't laugh for no reason, either.
Nor should you smile.

213
00:15:37,092 --> 00:15:38,551
Are we clear?

214
00:15:39,878 --> 00:15:41,258
Yes...

215
00:15:51,262 --> 00:15:55,619
<i>Do whatever it takes to get that
money back by the end of the month.</i>

216
00:15:57,343 --> 00:16:00,213
You'll be paid after completion.

217
00:16:00,397 --> 00:16:04,062
Just think of this as a test
you'll put me through.

218
00:16:05,084 --> 00:16:07,738
I'd like to meet
Congressman Jo Pilyeon.

219
00:16:08,032 --> 00:16:10,170
He's not the kind of man...

220
00:16:10,275 --> 00:16:12,179
who can spare any time for people like you.

221
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:16,673
But someone with his ambitions
would surely benefit from my help.

222
00:16:22,587 --> 00:16:25,244
<i>Do it right!</i>

223
00:16:44,704 --> 00:16:49,504
Is that how you treat our esteemed guests?

224
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:51,395
I apologize, Hyungnim.

225
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:56,834
Please, try to understand our situation.

226
00:17:10,419 --> 00:17:12,545
It's for you, President Maeng.

227
00:17:14,848 --> 00:17:16,500
Me?

228
00:17:25,427 --> 00:17:27,976
He...Hello?

229
00:17:28,141 --> 00:17:30,425
<i>H...Honey!</i>

230
00:17:30,832 --> 00:17:32,410
<i>I'm scared...</i>

231
00:17:32,487 --> 00:17:34,763
What's the matter?

232
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,354
<i>Strange people came here, and...</i>

233
00:17:38,436 --> 00:17:40,004
<i>Dad!</i>

234
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,065
<i>I'm scared, Dad!</i>

235
00:17:41,161 --> 00:17:42,852
Juhee! Ju...

236
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,763
You goddamned beasts...

237
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:50,537
What are you doing to my daughter?

238
00:17:54,284 --> 00:17:58,649
If you lay a single finger on her...

239
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,394
You will report us to the police?!

240
00:18:01,504 --> 00:18:03,269
Be my guest!

241
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:08,541
Then I'll show you what happens
when a rabid dog bites you.

242
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:17,550
<i>Your colleagues here gave up
their house to save their company,</i>

243
00:18:18,772 --> 00:18:23,749
but you have nothing to your name?!

244
00:18:51,461 --> 00:18:55,251
<i>What you did seem to have was
a pretty decent life insurance.</i>

245
00:18:55,376 --> 00:18:57,218
<i>So if you want to save your family,</i>

246
00:18:57,289 --> 00:19:00,213
<i>at least pay your debts with your life.</i>

247
00:19:01,302 --> 00:19:04,517
<i>Isn't that your duty
as head of the family?</i>

248
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:41,337
<i>Gangmo!</i>

249
00:19:41,428 --> 00:19:42,272
Gangmo!

250
00:19:42,343 --> 00:19:46,231
Gangmo...

251
00:19:47,323 --> 00:19:48,709
President Maeng...

252
00:19:48,826 --> 00:19:50,637
is dead.

253
00:19:52,219 --> 00:19:54,122
What?!

254
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:55,989
How did it happen?

255
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:59,478
Yesterday, he was involved
in a car accident.

256
00:20:00,112 --> 00:20:03,373
Ahh... I cursed him
deep down all this time,

257
00:20:03,472 --> 00:20:04,905
but I suddenly feel guilty?!

258
00:20:04,975 --> 00:20:06,546
Now you're screwed.

259
00:20:06,687 --> 00:20:10,975
He'll come after you from
the afterlife, seeking revenge.

260
00:20:11,069 --> 00:20:14,663
Ahh... You fool, someone is dead
and you're in the mood for jokes?

261
00:20:15,062 --> 00:20:16,801
Where is his wake?

262
00:20:41,066 --> 00:20:43,545
You'll soon receive that insurance money.

263
00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:46,257
You know my account number, right?

264
00:20:48,857 --> 00:20:50,936
If you really care about your daughter,

265
00:20:51,111 --> 00:20:52,898
you better wire that money.

266
00:20:56,523 --> 00:21:00,333
<i>And should you
ever tell anyone about us...</i>

267
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:02,165
You know, right?

268
00:21:12,296 --> 00:21:15,992
President Lee. So you and
President Maeng knew each other?

269
00:21:16,101 --> 00:21:19,738
Yes...
What are you doing here?

270
00:21:19,835 --> 00:21:22,202
We were just business acquaintances.

271
00:21:22,312 --> 00:21:26,000
We really lost a great man...

272
00:21:26,976 --> 00:21:31,815
Never lose courage,
and call me if you need anything.

273
00:21:31,945 --> 00:21:33,495
Got it?

274
00:22:14,895 --> 00:22:17,440
Thank you for coming.

275
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:22,245
I really don't know what to say.

276
00:22:29,234 --> 00:22:32,355
It's not much, but please accept it.

277
00:22:44,461 --> 00:22:46,314
President Lee.

278
00:22:47,723 --> 00:22:49,403
Are you leaving already?

279
00:22:51,353 --> 00:22:53,056
I'm a little busy.

280
00:22:54,325 --> 00:22:58,456
So I hear you and Hwang Jeongyeon
grew up together?

281
00:22:58,564 --> 00:23:02,183
I see you're quite good
at collecting information.

282
00:23:03,232 --> 00:23:06,556
When it turns out the woman you're
attracted to has male friends,

283
00:23:06,721 --> 00:23:08,882
you can't help but feel nervous.

284
00:23:09,904 --> 00:23:13,539
Can you let me in on
any secret to win her over?

285
00:23:14,725 --> 00:23:15,994
I can't say.

286
00:23:16,259 --> 00:23:19,894
If there is any such thing,
I'd like to hear it as well.

287
00:23:43,678 --> 00:23:47,395
Can I have a word with you?

288
00:23:53,444 --> 00:23:54,926
Good shot.

289
00:23:57,215 --> 00:23:58,695
My name is Cha Bucheol.

290
00:23:58,777 --> 00:24:00,402
Do you remember me?

291
00:24:00,479 --> 00:24:02,242
You know me?

292
00:24:04,387 --> 00:24:09,696
<i>{\a6}*Yojeong: upscale restaurants,
sort of an evolution of gisaeng parlors</i>

293
00:24:04,387 --> 00:24:09,696
We saw each other at the saloon*
where you met Baekpa.

294
00:24:11,281 --> 00:24:12,938
Is that so?

295
00:24:14,394 --> 00:24:16,846
You don't exactly come to mind?!

296
00:24:20,139 --> 00:24:22,101
<i>Sir, it's me, Bucheol.</i>

297
00:24:22,536 --> 00:24:24,450
I came to pay my respects.

298
00:24:24,978 --> 00:24:27,445
<i>Just leave for tonight.</i>

299
00:24:33,324 --> 00:24:36,842
<i>So what you want from me is money?</i>

300
00:24:38,087 --> 00:24:40,295
I'm sure you know that the
president's term will soon be over,

301
00:24:40,436 --> 00:24:47,148
<i>{\a6}*1983 bombing of Rangoon's Aung San
Mausoleum, while President Jeon was on visit</i>

302
00:24:40,436 --> 00:24:47,148
and that he's establishing a foundation for
the families of the Aung San bombing* victims.

303
00:24:47,547 --> 00:24:50,315
<i>A few chaebol groups
have already agreed...</i>

304
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,862
What kind of interest rate
are we looking at?

305
00:24:53,884 --> 00:24:55,411
Excuse me?

306
00:24:57,372 --> 00:25:00,485
If you want money from a private lender,

307
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:02,713
isn't paying interest a given?

308
00:25:02,823 --> 00:25:04,394
Sir...

309
00:25:04,522 --> 00:25:09,078
You dare ask for interests
when the president is involved?

310
00:25:09,184 --> 00:25:11,616
Regardless of their status,

311
00:25:11,743 --> 00:25:16,610
anyone who receives money from me
is nothing but a customer.

312
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:23,697
Looks like I'm dealing with an old fart
who doesn't know who he's dealing with!

313
00:25:24,835 --> 00:25:29,510
Even when senility knocks at the door,
you better remember this day.

314
00:25:29,709 --> 00:25:31,623
Are we clear?

315
00:25:48,869 --> 00:25:50,163
Sir...

316
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:52,968
"Foundation" certainly sounds better,

317
00:25:53,192 --> 00:25:54,965
but he's only trying to
create a secret fund.

318
00:25:55,074 --> 00:25:57,646
Still, trying to contend
with Congressman Jo...

319
00:25:57,763 --> 00:26:00,769
Money is power's middle name.

320
00:26:00,878 --> 00:26:05,575
There is no reason why someone
with my money should fear him.

321
00:26:10,531 --> 00:26:14,514
But, tell me.
What do I owe this visit to?

322
00:26:14,842 --> 00:26:18,155
How much do you think
Baekpa's assets amount to?

323
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:20,292
Let's get to the point.

324
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,606
I'll get my hands on all his money.

325
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:30,678
Of course, I couldn't do that by myself.

326
00:26:31,531 --> 00:26:33,693
Which is why I'm asking your help.

327
00:26:33,798 --> 00:26:35,028
Sounds fun.

328
00:26:35,125 --> 00:26:36,368
Continue.

329
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:38,694
I'm sure you know a
certain Hwang Jeongyeon.

330
00:26:38,786 --> 00:26:41,411
She is the daughter of Manbo
Construction's former chairman.

331
00:26:42,092 --> 00:26:42,924
I know her.

332
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:46,294
I've been instructed by Baekpa
to try to bring her down.

333
00:26:46,404 --> 00:26:50,179
If I manage to succeed,
I'll return under his wings.

334
00:26:50,303 --> 00:26:51,834
So the point is,

335
00:26:52,471 --> 00:26:56,888
if I help you deal with this,
you'll get your hands on Baekpa's fortune?

336
00:26:57,041 --> 00:26:58,089
I'm confident I can do it.

337
00:26:58,182 --> 00:26:59,519
Go back.

338
00:27:00,015 --> 00:27:01,208
Congressman...

339
00:27:01,306 --> 00:27:04,906
Don't think I have any time
to waste watching your back.

340
00:27:05,551 --> 00:27:07,046
When Baekpa dies,

341
00:27:07,152 --> 00:27:09,085
where do you think
all that money will end up?

342
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,391
Couldn't care less.

343
00:27:10,508 --> 00:27:11,330
Get him out of my sight.

344
00:27:11,424 --> 00:27:12,611
All right.

345
00:27:12,893 --> 00:27:14,500
- Let's go.
- That money!

346
00:27:14,578 --> 00:27:17,728
Will all go to Hwang Jeongyeon!

347
00:27:20,566 --> 00:27:22,149
What's that supposed to mean?

348
00:27:22,253 --> 00:27:25,581
Baekpa's money will all
go to Hwang Jeongyeon?!

349
00:27:26,286 --> 00:27:29,634
Baekpa's current heir Yoo Gyeongok...

350
00:27:30,396 --> 00:27:33,239
is Hwang Jeongyeon's birth mother.

351
00:27:37,103 --> 00:27:41,261
The moment Yoo Gyeongok
inherits Baekpa's fortune,

352
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:46,047
Hwang Jeongyeon will attempt
to reconquer Manbo Construction.

353
00:27:47,492 --> 00:27:50,018
Still no interest?

354
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:56,853
Looks like we might
need to have a word,

355
00:27:57,038 --> 00:27:58,988
so let's talk elsewhere.

356
00:28:08,785 --> 00:28:10,552
Jeongshik, that useless son of a...

357
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,157
So you're sure he's here, right?

358
00:28:12,267 --> 00:28:13,840
I verified his room firsthand.

359
00:28:14,051 --> 00:28:16,905
Ahh... I ought to just...

360
00:28:31,832 --> 00:28:34,634
Do you know how much your tab amounts to?

361
00:28:34,757 --> 00:28:36,986
Hey... Are you out of your mind?

362
00:28:37,127 --> 00:28:40,193
I risk getting fired because of you!

363
00:28:40,416 --> 00:28:41,450
Let's see that money...

364
00:28:41,547 --> 00:28:44,480
Pay back all the money
you spent in my name!

365
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:47,036
You little brat, I ought to...

366
00:28:47,135 --> 00:28:48,569
Let this go.

367
00:28:48,673 --> 00:28:49,782
I'm gonna hit you!

368
00:28:49,878 --> 00:28:51,514
Ohh... Now we even
add assault to the list?

369
00:28:51,619 --> 00:28:52,999
Go ahead then, be my guest!

370
00:28:53,089 --> 00:28:54,333
If you have all that
money to waste, go ahead!

371
00:28:54,391 --> 00:28:56,848
Aigoo... You're just
asking for trouble!

372
00:29:03,216 --> 00:29:04,696
Dad...

373
00:29:05,474 --> 00:29:07,644
Just my luck...

374
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:16,488
Jeongshik!

375
00:29:19,601 --> 00:29:21,926
What are you, Hong Gildong?

376
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:26,461
Showing up here, while you
should still be in America...

377
00:29:28,234 --> 00:29:31,937
Why is a young man like you
wasting his life this way?

378
00:29:32,066 --> 00:29:34,650
What's there to be surprised about?

379
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,093
I've always been a pathetic loser,
didn't you know?

380
00:29:37,176 --> 00:29:41,052
If you know how pathetic you are,
you should wake up!

381
00:29:43,416 --> 00:29:45,579
Why don't you wake up?

382
00:29:45,707 --> 00:29:46,799
Say what?

383
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:51,030
After throwing all your eggs in
Jeongyeon's basket and ending up penniless,

384
00:29:51,133 --> 00:29:52,966
now you suddenly feel inclined
to treat me like a son?

385
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,200
You stupid little...

386
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:55,826
You know?

387
00:29:56,249 --> 00:29:58,374
I have no use for a
penniless father, either.

388
00:29:58,451 --> 00:29:59,925
So, please!

389
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:03,191
Don't ever show your face
around me, is that clear?

390
00:30:03,273 --> 00:30:05,175
You little fool!

391
00:30:07,255 --> 00:30:08,834
Why did you hit me?

392
00:30:08,913 --> 00:30:11,457
How can you have the nerve to hit me?

393
00:30:11,549 --> 00:30:18,596
Sure, you might hate to see me
in such a pathetic state,

394
00:30:18,796 --> 00:30:22,829
but it's exactly because you're in this
pathetic state that I can't abandon you!

395
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:30,620
If you'd made something out of your life,
I wouldn't even be here, you fool!

396
00:30:31,149 --> 00:30:33,193
But look at you...

397
00:30:33,557 --> 00:30:39,401
How can seeing what has
become of you not break my heart?

398
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:41,633
Good to hear.

399
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:44,860
Because that heart of yours will
suffer a lot more from now on.

400
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:45,922
Say what?

401
00:30:46,019 --> 00:30:47,822
And you know why?

402
00:30:48,449 --> 00:30:51,228
Because I'll walk straight
into the pits of hell.

403
00:30:51,708 --> 00:30:56,021
Take a good look
at your son's downfall.

404
00:30:56,138 --> 00:30:59,732
Look and cry tears of regret
for the rest of your days!

405
00:30:59,815 --> 00:31:01,886
Is that clear?

406
00:31:03,096 --> 00:31:04,694
Wait!

407
00:31:04,893 --> 00:31:06,103
Jeongshik!

408
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:07,971
Jeongshik!!

409
00:31:20,947 --> 00:31:23,085
Jo Pilyeon is here.

410
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:28,044
It would be wise to leave this place.

411
00:31:28,831 --> 00:31:33,353
Go after Jeongshik, will you?

412
00:31:34,011 --> 00:31:39,367
I'm just worried he
might try something stupid.

413
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:42,783
Just find out where he's going.

414
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,798
All right.

415
00:32:02,465 --> 00:32:04,520
Jo Pilyeon...

416
00:32:05,297 --> 00:32:09,740
It's all because of
that damned Jo Pilyeon...

417
00:32:10,213 --> 00:32:11,750
Fine.

418
00:32:12,255 --> 00:32:16,978
I'll just get rid of that bastard,
and die along with him!

419
00:32:17,094 --> 00:32:21,975
Fine, let's get it over with!

420
00:32:22,808 --> 00:32:27,213
So Baekpa's fortune could
all go to Hwang Jeongyeon?

421
00:32:27,588 --> 00:32:31,078
Since Yoo Gyeongok is her mother,
it's quite a plausible scenario.

422
00:32:31,172 --> 00:32:35,422
Thankfully, someone working for
Baekpa volunteered to help us.

423
00:32:35,764 --> 00:32:37,044
And who is that?

424
00:32:37,134 --> 00:32:39,153
You'll find out in due time.

425
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:44,592
First, we need to help him
cause Hwang Jeongyeon's downfall.

426
00:32:44,745 --> 00:32:48,629
I'll need your help down
the line, just so you know.

427
00:32:58,164 --> 00:33:00,608
<i>Jo Pilyeon!!</i>

428
00:33:08,325 --> 00:33:11,602
I'll kill you once and for all!

429
00:33:11,926 --> 00:33:16,753
Think you can kill me
with that rock alone?

430
00:33:16,847 --> 00:33:22,227
That's right...
I'll see you in hell!

431
00:34:31,517 --> 00:34:32,891
Congressman!

432
00:34:40,456 --> 00:34:41,889
How dare...

433
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:45,335
How dare you do this to him!

434
00:34:50,386 --> 00:34:52,664
- Calm down, Seonbaenim.
- Let go!

435
00:34:52,852 --> 00:34:56,130
I'll handle this, so escort him out.

436
00:35:04,164 --> 00:35:06,009
Are you all right?

437
00:35:10,179 --> 00:35:12,501
Hwang Taeseop...

438
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:18,268
Next time we meet,
consider yourself dead!

439
00:35:18,785 --> 00:35:20,312
Congressman...

440
00:35:26,485 --> 00:35:28,212
<i>Jo Pilyeon!</i>

441
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,382
I will kill you with my own hands!

442
00:35:33,334 --> 00:35:35,741
You're human trash!

443
00:35:47,909 --> 00:35:51,497
What do you think
Jo Pilyeon fears the most?

444
00:35:52,557 --> 00:35:55,242
If you really want to get revenge,

445
00:35:56,068 --> 00:36:00,810
first find a way to destroy
everything he's accomplished so far.

446
00:36:05,703 --> 00:36:09,168
Who really are you?

447
00:36:11,045 --> 00:36:14,724
Despite working for Jo Pilyeon,
why are you trying...

448
00:36:14,794 --> 00:36:17,342
I'm just someone who bears...

449
00:36:17,695 --> 00:36:20,619
as big a grudge against
Jo Pilyeon as you do.

450
00:36:21,853 --> 00:36:24,449
I might not know when it will come,

451
00:36:25,165 --> 00:36:30,732
but one of us will one day
cause Jo Pilyeon's downfall.

452
00:36:30,826 --> 00:36:33,048
Who on earth are you?

453
00:36:34,799 --> 00:36:38,969
You will soon find out.

454
00:36:57,813 --> 00:36:59,424
Jeongshik...

455
00:36:59,791 --> 00:37:02,088
Please, get a hold of yourself!

456
00:37:02,213 --> 00:37:05,911
Where did you get so drunk?

457
00:37:12,027 --> 00:37:13,320
I'll get you some honey water.

458
00:37:13,427 --> 00:37:15,034
Drink it and go to sleep.

459
00:37:15,212 --> 00:37:17,372
<i>I met Dad.</i>

460
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,504
My father...

461
00:37:24,338 --> 00:37:26,616
Your ex-husband.

462
00:37:27,504 --> 00:37:29,435
I met him after four years.

463
00:37:29,941 --> 00:37:31,468
So?

464
00:37:32,466 --> 00:37:34,451
What did your father say?

465
00:37:37,112 --> 00:37:39,144
Is that what you care about?

466
00:37:39,731 --> 00:37:41,539
You're not even asking how he's doing?

467
00:37:41,633 --> 00:37:43,608
What did he tell you?

468
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:51,261
He was in such good shape
that at first I felt relieved,

469
00:37:52,471 --> 00:37:54,891
which quickly turned into anger.

470
00:37:56,512 --> 00:38:02,642
When he left for the States,
I blamed ourselves for abandoning him.

471
00:38:03,641 --> 00:38:05,520
But seeing him like that,

472
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:09,044
it rather feels like we were
the ones to be abandoned.

473
00:38:15,258 --> 00:38:20,727
But I'm even angrier at you now.

474
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:22,641
Why would you?

475
00:38:22,859 --> 00:38:27,434
You abandoned my father,
and only live for that damned bottle!

476
00:38:27,563 --> 00:38:31,620
What other joy left do I have?

477
00:38:31,961 --> 00:38:34,243
My only son spends all day gambling,

478
00:38:34,339 --> 00:38:35,901
and we're about to go broke,

479
00:38:36,006 --> 00:38:37,910
how else can I cope with all this?

480
00:38:38,003 --> 00:38:39,713
Is this what you divorced for?

481
00:38:39,831 --> 00:38:40,606
What?

482
00:38:40,676 --> 00:38:43,332
This is all your fault!

483
00:38:44,056 --> 00:38:45,646
You forced Dad to leave us,

484
00:38:45,742 --> 00:38:47,572
you lost all our money!

485
00:38:47,736 --> 00:38:49,610
It's all because of you!

486
00:38:49,703 --> 00:38:51,930
And you're telling me you
don't know who I did that for?

487
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,091
At least spare me
that "for your sake" excuse!

488
00:38:54,173 --> 00:38:55,245
Jeongshik!

489
00:38:55,351 --> 00:38:57,131
I've had it with you.

490
00:38:57,261 --> 00:38:59,575
You make me sick!

491
00:38:59,739 --> 00:39:01,388
You insolent little...

492
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:11,691
Jeongshik...

493
00:39:12,572 --> 00:39:14,311
Are you all right?

494
00:39:17,811 --> 00:39:19,624
I'm sorry, Jeongshik...

495
00:39:20,353 --> 00:39:22,620
Forgive me...

496
00:39:22,843 --> 00:39:27,048
Forgive your mother, Jeongshik...
I'm so sorry...

497
00:39:27,397 --> 00:39:31,028
- I'm so...
- Don't touch me!

498
00:39:35,006 --> 00:39:36,721
Jeongshik...

499
00:39:37,344 --> 00:39:39,505
I can't breathe...

500
00:39:39,935 --> 00:39:43,435
It's driving me insane!

501
00:39:49,237 --> 00:39:52,715
Jeongshik... Jeongshik!!

502
00:40:05,411 --> 00:40:06,899
What?!

503
00:40:08,191 --> 00:40:10,254
"You make me sick"?!

504
00:40:12,908 --> 00:40:15,516
You bastard...

505
00:40:19,201 --> 00:40:23,149
You're the only thing I live for...

506
00:40:36,915 --> 00:40:38,959
How can you refuse any loans?

507
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:41,137
Why are you suddenly acting like that?

508
00:40:41,246 --> 00:40:42,311
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

509
00:40:42,415 --> 00:40:43,740
Please go back.

510
00:40:44,292 --> 00:40:45,879
If that business plan was insufficient,

511
00:40:45,994 --> 00:40:48,074
I'll add whatever is needed.

512
00:40:48,897 --> 00:40:51,256
Your business plan is not the issue.

513
00:40:51,363 --> 00:40:53,718
Is it because of Congressman Jo Pilyeon?

514
00:40:56,185 --> 00:41:00,144
Anyhow, our bank cannot
lend you that money.

515
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,283
President...

516
00:41:02,459 --> 00:41:03,622
President!

517
00:41:03,798 --> 00:41:05,478
Director Han?!

518
00:41:12,925 --> 00:41:13,937
Director Hwang?!

519
00:41:14,043 --> 00:41:17,838
What do you mean, saying Jo Pilyeon
tried to stop them from lending you money?

520
00:41:18,015 --> 00:41:20,270
You know Congressman Jo?

521
00:41:23,343 --> 00:41:27,459
I blocked Director Han's
loan as instructed.

522
00:41:36,051 --> 00:41:38,036
Well done.

523
00:41:46,279 --> 00:41:48,452
Right as I was trying to
acquire a boiler company,

524
00:41:48,675 --> 00:41:50,813
Manbo Construction got in the way.

525
00:41:51,049 --> 00:41:54,466
So that's why Congressman Jo
would interfere with that bank loan.

526
00:41:54,578 --> 00:41:57,421
We were just about to sign...

527
00:41:58,877 --> 00:42:03,082
By gas boilers company,
what are we talking about?

528
00:42:05,995 --> 00:42:09,247
I'm sure you'll be familiar
with France's Beaute.

529
00:42:09,581 --> 00:42:13,699
Over half the boilers used in
apartments come from them.

530
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:18,139
<i>I understand why Manbo
Construction would be interested.</i>

531
00:42:18,676 --> 00:42:20,580
Do you have enough funds
for the acquisition?

532
00:42:20,686 --> 00:42:23,744
I'm selling my overseas
real estate as we speak.

533
00:42:23,856 --> 00:42:25,649
Once I'm done with that,

534
00:42:25,777 --> 00:42:29,722
I might be able to present
a competitive bidding price.

535
00:42:30,518 --> 00:42:33,713
<i>But the deposit is the real issue.</i>

536
00:42:33,838 --> 00:42:37,925
You need to settle that on
the same day you win the bid,

537
00:42:38,053 --> 00:42:40,750
and now that Congressman Jo froze that money...

538
00:42:40,874 --> 00:42:43,416
How much would that deposit amount to?

539
00:42:43,534 --> 00:42:45,167
Since it's 10 percent of the entire price,

540
00:42:45,272 --> 00:42:47,556
it will be about 1.2 billion.

541
00:42:50,164 --> 00:42:51,550
So...

542
00:42:51,813 --> 00:42:56,319
Would you be able to
lend me just 300 million?

543
00:42:56,601 --> 00:42:58,222
300 million?

544
00:42:59,103 --> 00:43:01,131
It's all I'm missing.

545
00:43:01,272 --> 00:43:04,631
I can use my overseas
real estate as collateral.

546
00:43:04,913 --> 00:43:09,036
300 million is our entire
capital at the moment.

547
00:43:09,177 --> 00:43:13,852
I don't want Manbo Construction to
steal that acquisition under my nose.

548
00:43:14,318 --> 00:43:16,902
Please help me out, Director Hwang.

549
00:43:34,102 --> 00:43:36,099
<i>Birth name, Cha Bucheol.</i>

550
00:43:36,315 --> 00:43:39,928
<i>After working under Baekpa,
he was kicked out for improper conduct.</i>

551
00:43:40,121 --> 00:43:43,615
He also has a past as a
sort of private lender hunter,

552
00:43:43,869 --> 00:43:46,548
and he's got quite the precedents,
both for assault and fraud.

553
00:43:46,652 --> 00:43:50,210
Then, how about that
"Han Sojin" card he gave me?

554
00:43:50,337 --> 00:43:52,279
He's actually an overseas resident.

555
00:43:52,432 --> 00:43:55,826
Cha Bucheol merely forged his documents.

556
00:43:56,057 --> 00:43:58,360
So it was a forgery...

557
00:43:58,665 --> 00:44:01,848
And I was wondering why
I couldn't find a thing...

558
00:44:05,396 --> 00:44:09,399
He's joined forces
with Jo Pilyeon and his son.

559
00:44:09,507 --> 00:44:11,184
What are they after?

560
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,510
Baekpa's fortune.

561
00:44:14,908 --> 00:44:17,885
He set his sights
on Hwang Jeongyeon's money...

562
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:22,345
so that he could regain
Baekpa's confidence.

563
00:44:25,399 --> 00:44:30,144
If things go our way, we could
use his own trap against him.

564
00:44:31,683 --> 00:44:36,125
Jo Minwoo is trying to
acquire a boiler company.

565
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:39,931
And should I join that race,
what do you think will happen?

566
00:44:40,049 --> 00:44:42,539
Guess a bidding war will begin.

567
00:44:42,834 --> 00:44:47,359
- But facing Manbo Construction...
- Cha Bucheol...

568
00:44:47,494 --> 00:44:49,242
We will use him.

569
00:44:49,339 --> 00:44:51,774
If it's to help Hwang Jeongyeon,

570
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:54,440
we have plenty of
alternatives besides this.

571
00:44:54,653 --> 00:44:58,505
We need to get our hands
on that boiler company as well.

572
00:44:59,012 --> 00:45:00,844
If things go as planned,

573
00:45:01,021 --> 00:45:05,343
I'll be able to help Jeongyeon
and our company at the same time.

574
00:45:07,526 --> 00:45:10,324
I'm fully aware of your situation,

575
00:45:10,474 --> 00:45:12,295
but in our position,
300 million is much too...

576
00:45:12,412 --> 00:45:14,262
I'll pay you a generous interest.

577
00:45:14,432 --> 00:45:18,555
And if we manage to acquire Beaute,
I'll soon pay back the principal, too.

578
00:45:41,596 --> 00:45:43,254
What is that fax about?

579
00:45:43,361 --> 00:45:46,620
Ohh... From the revenue office.

580
00:45:47,148 --> 00:45:52,328
I've heard you bear a grudge
against Manbo Construction as well.

581
00:45:52,828 --> 00:45:55,311
Please, help me out.

582
00:45:57,144 --> 00:45:59,690
Instead, I have a condition.

583
00:45:59,893 --> 00:46:00,915
Go ahead and tell me.

584
00:46:01,044 --> 00:46:06,092
I will join your acquisition bid
as a shareholder.

585
00:46:06,181 --> 00:46:08,771
So the money you're giving me...

586
00:46:08,866 --> 00:46:11,284
It won't be a loan, but an investment.

587
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:14,125
I'm investing in you.

588
00:46:14,292 --> 00:46:15,402
Director!

589
00:46:15,494 --> 00:46:16,921
Thank you!

590
00:46:17,101 --> 00:46:18,859
Thank you, Director Hwang!

591
00:46:18,953 --> 00:46:21,296
When is Beaute's conference again?

592
00:46:21,395 --> 00:46:23,418
It's planned for the day after tomorrow.

593
00:46:23,581 --> 00:46:25,589
I'll see you there, then.

594
00:46:25,685 --> 00:46:27,211
All right.

595
00:46:27,321 --> 00:46:31,193
You won't regret this decision.

596
00:46:36,435 --> 00:46:37,598
Eonni...

597
00:46:37,756 --> 00:46:40,740
What if Baekpa finds out?

598
00:46:49,226 --> 00:46:50,952
Hwang Jeongyeon...

599
00:46:51,469 --> 00:46:54,500
You'll soon be history.

600
00:47:08,425 --> 00:47:11,583
What did you want to meet for?

601
00:47:11,703 --> 00:47:15,413
Just wanted to hear your business plans.

602
00:47:15,589 --> 00:47:16,855
Uh?

603
00:47:17,924 --> 00:47:19,909
Bu...siness... plans?

604
00:47:20,172 --> 00:47:25,644
That... If I had to list all the
investors, it would be a little...

605
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:30,531
I know that you don't
have a single investor.

606
00:47:33,561 --> 00:47:39,513
I was still waiting
for you to open up first.

607
00:47:42,685 --> 00:47:44,977
All right then, I...

608
00:47:45,071 --> 00:47:46,608
I actually...

609
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:49,777
have nothing on my plate.

610
00:47:50,705 --> 00:47:52,502
I'm empty-handed.

611
00:47:52,702 --> 00:47:55,212
<i>So I just wanted to
find some desolated backwoods...</i>

612
00:47:55,318 --> 00:47:58,422
<i>and even kill myself once and for all,</i>

613
00:47:58,528 --> 00:48:01,594
but you know,
that so-called flesh and blood...

614
00:48:02,336 --> 00:48:05,692
I still have a daughter, so here I am.

615
00:48:07,513 --> 00:48:14,478
Aigoo, how the mighty have fallen...

616
00:48:15,439 --> 00:48:18,184
What would you like to do?

617
00:48:19,606 --> 00:48:21,802
If only I could be allowed to,

618
00:48:22,096 --> 00:48:26,407
I'd love to give politics a try.

619
00:48:27,182 --> 00:48:28,599
Politics?!

620
00:48:28,715 --> 00:48:31,013
While running my company,

621
00:48:31,397 --> 00:48:37,388
I filled so many politicians'
pockets, you can't imagine.

622
00:48:37,963 --> 00:48:41,809
So I know what they're itching for,
their troubles and what they want.

623
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,303
I know it all.

624
00:48:45,078 --> 00:48:49,060
And I'm not merely
trying to make it big.

625
00:48:49,775 --> 00:48:52,694
Because I lived
without shame for so long,

626
00:48:52,976 --> 00:48:59,662
I know how to handle shameless
pricks like Jo Pilyeon quite well.

627
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:09,473
If I'll devote the rest of my days
to rid politics of someone like Jo Pilyeon,

628
00:49:09,591 --> 00:49:12,927
it is only for this country's sake.

629
00:49:15,123 --> 00:49:16,979
At least that's what I wish for,

630
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:22,733
but in this state, I couldn't even
dream of getting into politics...

631
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:33,493
What is this?

632
00:49:33,610 --> 00:49:39,724
With this much, you'll easily be able
to start a business or get into politics.

633
00:49:40,816 --> 00:49:42,662
Forget it.

634
00:49:42,801 --> 00:49:45,761
How can I accept that money?

635
00:49:45,890 --> 00:49:50,251
I don't deserve to
be Jeongyeon's mother.

636
00:49:51,168 --> 00:50:00,071
So at least you should
make her proud of you.

637
00:50:00,971 --> 00:50:02,979
Gyeongok...

638
00:50:08,711 --> 00:50:12,364
I left a car for you outside.

639
00:50:14,137 --> 00:50:19,898
I don't like men
staying at home all day.

640
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:25,513
Gyeo...Gyeongok.

641
00:50:33,133 --> 00:50:34,719
I really...

642
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:42,306
I've made her suffer her entire life...

643
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:49,460
What did she ever
find in someone like me?

644
00:50:52,141 --> 00:50:53,465
All right.

645
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,165
Forget everything else,

646
00:50:57,245 --> 00:51:03,729
but I'll become a father
Jeongyeon can be proud of.

647
00:51:24,682 --> 00:51:26,328
That's right.

648
00:51:27,115 --> 00:51:30,228
I'm going to succeed at all cost.

649
00:51:34,886 --> 00:51:36,578
Gyeongok...

650
00:51:36,995 --> 00:51:38,221
<i>Yes.</i>

651
00:51:38,336 --> 00:51:40,768
Aigoo! We've got plenty of apartments!

652
00:51:40,874 --> 00:51:44,868
These days in Gangnam you see
a new one pop up every morning,

653
00:51:44,962 --> 00:51:46,835
so come here and take a look...

654
00:51:46,931 --> 00:51:50,203
Oh my... Aigoo! Chairman!

655
00:51:50,313 --> 00:51:51,635
- Aigoo, Director Ju!
- Aigoo!

656
00:51:51,718 --> 00:51:52,458
Chairman!

657
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:54,478
When did you come back?

658
00:51:54,783 --> 00:51:56,276
So you completely recovered?

659
00:51:56,367 --> 00:51:58,249
Have you been doing fine?

660
00:51:58,550 --> 00:51:59,662
Of course...

661
00:51:59,770 --> 00:52:03,733
These days real estate is
doing well, so we can't complain.

662
00:52:04,058 --> 00:52:06,242
I was planning on
getting myself an office,

663
00:52:06,349 --> 00:52:08,685
can you find a lucky spot for me?

664
00:52:08,802 --> 00:52:10,476
Aigoo, sure!

665
00:52:10,599 --> 00:52:14,165
Why do you think they called him
Jaesu (literally: "luck")?

666
00:52:14,285 --> 00:52:19,735
I'll give you a nice office
in our same building, Chairman.

667
00:52:53,041 --> 00:52:54,568
Lee Gangmo.

668
00:52:55,202 --> 00:52:56,776
How can you do this to me?

669
00:52:56,917 --> 00:52:57,686
Do what?

670
00:52:57,792 --> 00:53:00,687
You entrusted the aggregate sale to me.

671
00:53:00,808 --> 00:53:03,752
So why would you let people
who betrayed us get subcontracts?

672
00:53:03,849 --> 00:53:06,135
Aigoo... Why always bring that up?

673
00:53:06,194 --> 00:53:08,320
You stay out of this!

674
00:53:10,763 --> 00:53:12,961
I told you I could do this, didn't I?

675
00:53:13,066 --> 00:53:16,037
Is it because you can't trust me?

676
00:53:16,483 --> 00:53:18,374
It's not that.

677
00:53:18,764 --> 00:53:21,826
After what happened to
President Maeng, if they end up...

678
00:53:21,873 --> 00:53:23,251
<i>I know!</i>

679
00:53:23,349 --> 00:53:25,248
I know how hard it is to deal with me.

680
00:53:25,345 --> 00:53:29,710
But wasn't that something you
should have at least discussed with me?

681
00:53:29,822 --> 00:53:32,312
Hey... Hey... Sotae!
What's wrong with you today?

682
00:53:32,394 --> 00:53:34,368
Stop it, Hyung!

683
00:53:38,561 --> 00:53:41,082
- You really...
- Hey... Sotae...

684
00:53:41,178 --> 00:53:42,719
Sotae!

685
00:53:43,917 --> 00:53:47,337
That temper...

686
00:53:47,537 --> 00:53:50,720
He must be really angry?

687
00:53:52,987 --> 00:53:54,526
Director Nam.

688
00:53:55,912 --> 00:54:02,459
You said that 12 billion won would be
enough to acquire that gas boiler company?

689
00:54:02,576 --> 00:54:04,526
Yeah... But why?

690
00:54:04,655 --> 00:54:07,404
Why, interested in buying it?

691
00:54:08,262 --> 00:54:09,398
Yes.

692
00:54:10,358 --> 00:54:13,482
But you said we don't have the money.

693
00:55:06,430 --> 00:55:08,792
Even if surrounded by riches,

694
00:55:09,019 --> 00:55:12,058
all that remains of me is an old carcass.

695
00:55:12,788 --> 00:55:15,964
And I guess I will soon
abandon that as well?

696
00:55:16,105 --> 00:55:21,003
In the end, you take nothing with you
on your way to the afterlife.

697
00:55:22,201 --> 00:55:25,361
- Hearing you say that...
- I...

698
00:55:25,925 --> 00:55:29,363
envy the fact you
build houses for a living.

699
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:32,065
What is a house, after all?

700
00:55:32,155 --> 00:55:36,493
Is it not a precious vessel
sheltering one's beloved family?

701
00:55:36,681 --> 00:55:39,218
And inside this vessel you built,

702
00:55:39,312 --> 00:55:45,329
people will help each other, they will
together dream and share happiness.

703
00:55:45,470 --> 00:55:48,112
How impressive is that?

704
00:55:51,026 --> 00:55:53,809
Don't just work to make money.

705
00:55:54,346 --> 00:55:56,987
Just think of the people who will
live in the houses you built...

706
00:55:57,093 --> 00:56:00,417
even after you're gone.

707
00:56:00,793 --> 00:56:04,000
Then, should you face
even greater difficulties,

708
00:56:04,211 --> 00:56:06,666
you'll always be able to overcome them.

709
00:56:06,824 --> 00:56:09,100
I will always bear it in mind, Sir.

710
00:56:09,805 --> 00:56:12,284
A gas boiler company, you said?

711
00:56:12,565 --> 00:56:14,257
Yes.

712
00:56:17,064 --> 00:56:22,715
The poorer one is, the harder
it becomes to endure winter.

713
00:56:24,653 --> 00:56:26,227
Give it a try.

714
00:56:26,399 --> 00:56:28,564
Thank you, Sir!

715
00:56:38,145 --> 00:56:42,090
<i>- English Conversation -</i>

716
00:56:48,567 --> 00:56:50,552
Director...

717
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:56,998
You still haven't finished
yesterday's assignment?

718
00:56:57,832 --> 00:56:59,300
Director...

719
00:56:59,429 --> 00:57:06,175
Isn't singing well
all that a singer needs?

720
00:57:06,337 --> 00:57:08,579
What are all these difficult books,

721
00:57:08,721 --> 00:57:11,777
not to mention the make-up,
the clothes, even table manners...

722
00:57:11,910 --> 00:57:15,177
I only have eyes for the very best.

723
00:57:15,318 --> 00:57:19,610
If you can't manage to do this much,
you should just quit.

724
00:57:19,717 --> 00:57:22,383
You can just go back to the shoe store.

725
00:57:22,688 --> 00:57:24,815
I apologize, Director.

726
00:57:25,137 --> 00:57:27,599
- I'll work harder.
- I will work harder, Ma'am!

727
00:57:27,716 --> 00:57:30,230
Told you to stop talking
like a little girl, didn't I?

728
00:57:30,570 --> 00:57:31,762
Yes...

729
00:57:31,869 --> 00:57:34,429
Get prepared, we're going
to record your album.

730
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:36,513
Album?!

731
00:57:36,928 --> 00:57:38,651
You really...

732
00:57:40,412 --> 00:57:42,072
I apologize.

733
00:57:42,184 --> 00:57:44,019
We found a few nice songs.

734
00:57:44,209 --> 00:57:46,062
They'll suit you.

735
00:57:53,589 --> 00:58:07,267
You're going to leave me anyhow.

736
00:58:07,866 --> 00:58:15,445
It must have finally come,

737
00:58:15,816 --> 00:58:22,649
Time to leave each other.

738
00:58:22,944 --> 00:58:36,301
My heart is telling me to hold onto you.

739
00:58:36,470 --> 00:58:43,492
But after going back and forth
a thousand times,

740
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:49,661
It is finally time to say goodbye.

741
00:58:49,838 --> 00:58:56,843
I guess it looks as if I'm laughing,

742
00:58:56,995 --> 00:59:00,244
<i>But it hurts so much I feel like dying.</i>

743
00:59:00,848 --> 00:59:02,262
<i>No.</i>

744
00:59:02,426 --> 00:59:04,261
<i>I'm not eating fish.</i>

745
00:59:04,385 --> 00:59:07,068
You need to eat this
if you want to grow taller.

746
00:59:07,182 --> 00:59:08,457
No way.

747
00:59:08,555 --> 00:59:10,032
I said no...

748
00:59:10,145 --> 00:59:12,293
I don't like fish.

749
00:59:12,398 --> 00:59:14,970
<i>Aigoo... Stubborn little rascal...</i>

750
00:59:15,056 --> 00:59:18,172
Who did you take after,
disliking fish so much?

751
00:59:19,689 --> 00:59:21,214
<i>It's so good.</i>

752
00:59:21,284 --> 00:59:24,168
<i>Here, come on.</i>

753
00:59:31,354 --> 00:59:33,588
Ahh... That's so dirty...

754
00:59:33,697 --> 00:59:35,113
How can you use the same chopstick...

755
00:59:35,195 --> 00:59:38,425
You can't eat fish, can you?

756
00:59:39,079 --> 00:59:42,668
See? You haven't touched it once.

757
00:59:42,798 --> 00:59:45,100
Who said I can't eat this?

758
00:59:45,593 --> 00:59:48,210
I just don't like, that's all.

759
00:59:48,330 --> 00:59:50,503
<i>See? You can't!</i>

760
00:59:50,703 --> 00:59:53,745
<i>How can an adult be fussy about fish?</i>

761
00:59:53,853 --> 00:59:56,505
<i>You need to eat it.</i>

762
00:59:56,646 --> 00:59:58,537
Mommy...

763
01:00:00,596 --> 01:00:04,229
Mommy, I don't want to eat fish.

764
01:00:04,772 --> 01:00:07,043
If you don't like it,
you don't need to eat fish.

765
01:00:07,125 --> 01:00:11,299
Instead, while Mommy is at work,
you need to obey Grandma.

766
01:00:11,403 --> 01:00:13,423
Aigoo, my pretty boy.

767
01:00:14,524 --> 01:00:20,553
Right... I've heard someone
came looking for you at the store.

768
01:00:21,403 --> 01:00:23,464
It was your brother.

769
01:00:24,744 --> 01:00:27,963
How much longer will
you keep avoiding them?

770
01:00:28,785 --> 01:00:30,100
I don't know.

771
01:00:30,218 --> 01:00:33,150
I understand you're doing this
because of Wooju,

772
01:00:33,273 --> 01:00:36,512
but you can't keep living apart
for the rest of your days.

773
01:00:37,190 --> 01:00:40,483
If you become famous
and start going on TV,

774

<i>they'll find out right away.</i>

How are you, President Lee?

776
01:01:00,610 --> 01:01:02,453
We meet often, these days?

777
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:08,185
But I didn't know you were
interested in boiler companies.

778
01:01:08,725 --> 01:01:12,543
I should be surprised to meet
you two here, on the contrary.

779
01:01:12,778 --> 01:01:17,079
I was convinced by
Director Han to invest in him.

780
01:01:17,342 --> 01:01:18,857
I see.

781
01:01:19,091 --> 01:01:20,960
Unexpected competition as it might be,

782
01:01:21,167 --> 01:01:22,727
may the best man win.

783
01:01:22,836 --> 01:01:25,846
I wish you luck as well.

01:02:59,219 --> 01:03:01,873
Will Hangang Construction
ever be able to contend with us?

806
01:03:01,991 --> 01:03:06,877
I see you still don't know
who our investor is.

807
01:03:07,171 --> 01:03:08,651
Who is he?

808
01:03:09,344 --> 01:03:10,867
Baekpa.

809
01:03:12,776 --> 01:03:14,397
A money struggle?

810
01:03:15,324 --> 01:03:17,732
Shall we give it a try, then?

811
01:03:17,909 --> 01:03:20,153
It went your way last time,

812
01:03:20,258 --> 01:03:22,126
but things will be different.

813
01:03:22,678 --> 01:03:27,827
I'm not losing this bid to you.

814
01:03:28,309 --> 01:03:30,129
<i>That's interesting.</i>

815
01:03:34,097 --> 01:03:37,036
We're not going to give up, either.

816
01:03:38,469 --> 01:03:39,783
Isn't that right, Director Han?

817
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:41,615
Of course.

818
01:03:41,837 --> 01:03:46,772
This bid is a three-way fight?!

819
01:03:49,368 --> 01:03:52,492
I put my life on the line
for this bid, too.

820
01:03:52,621 --> 01:03:57,766
Better get ready.

826
01:04:26,761 --> 01:04:29,762
Just this once, allow me
to roar one last time.

827
01:04:29,862 --> 01:04:33,551
- And roar against whom?
- Jo Pilyeon.

828
01:04:33,682 --> 01:04:35,456
<i>Who the hell are you to act like that?</i>

829
01:04:35,564 --> 01:04:38,139
This is not something
you're doing on your own.

830
01:04:38,249 --> 01:04:39,365
<i>You're not giving up until I do.</i>

831
01:04:39,447 --> 01:04:40,704
And who the hell is Gangmo?

832
01:04:40,786 --> 01:04:44,146
<i>Is he any different than us,
to treat us like this?</i>

833
01:04:44,216 --> 01:04:45,522
You ungrateful prick.

834
01:04:45,612 --> 01:04:49,085
Doesn't it feel like I might be
the only one left who can save you?

835
01:04:49,202 --> 01:04:50,931
We finalized our bidding price.

836
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:52,127
It's 12.7 billion.

837
01:04:52,221 --> 01:04:53,842
12.7 billion.

838
01:04:53,948 --> 01:04:57,187
<i>Once Lee Gangmo fails to pay
on time, they will contact us.</i>

839
01:04:57,292 --> 01:04:59,501
I'll have to trust Sotae.
