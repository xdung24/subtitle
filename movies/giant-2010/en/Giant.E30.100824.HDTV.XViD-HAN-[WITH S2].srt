- Episode 30 -

4
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,550
Gangmo...

5
00:01:03,823 --> 00:01:05,301
Chairman!

6
00:01:13,376 --> 00:01:15,484
<i>You may wait outside.</i>

7
00:01:19,814 --> 00:01:23,569
What's your relationship 
with the patient?

8
00:01:25,347 --> 00:01:27,615
Looked like you knew each other well?

9
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:35,446
I don't know him.

10
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:38,859
You don't?

11
00:01:49,679 --> 00:01:51,138
It's me, Hyung.

12
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,886
Chairman Hwang was assaulted.

13
00:01:55,185 --> 00:01:59,210
No... I couldn't see who did it.

14
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:09,446
Where are you now?

15
00:02:09,681 --> 00:02:11,629
I'll come there.

16
00:02:20,295 --> 00:02:23,350
That's Lee Gangmo for sure.

17
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:27,463
Taeseop...
What is all this?

18
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:29,103
- Dad...
- Honey...

19
00:02:29,169 --> 00:02:30,806
- Dad!
- Here...

20
00:02:30,863 --> 00:02:32,529
He's going through surgery now,

21
00:02:32,613 --> 00:02:35,343
so don't stay here and
go to the waiting room.

22
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,084
- Let's go.
- Jeongshik...

23
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:41,187
What's going on?!

24
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,558
Get out of the way!

25
00:03:40,414 --> 00:03:41,984
Seonbaenim.

26
00:03:42,268 --> 00:03:44,293
What are you doing here?

27
00:03:44,471 --> 00:03:46,504
Haven't you seen Lee Gangmo pass by?

28
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:47,469
Lee Gangmo?!

29
00:03:47,567 --> 00:03:50,075
That guy was Lee Gangmo, catch him.

30
00:03:50,233 --> 00:03:52,737
Wait a moment, Seonbaenim.
What are you talking about?

31
00:03:52,831 --> 00:03:54,318
Why would a dead man be here...

32
00:03:54,422 --> 00:03:56,464
He's alive!

33
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,803
We must catch him now.

34
00:04:12,526 --> 00:04:14,136
Who are you?

35
00:04:15,303 --> 00:04:16,799
Are you sure it was Lee Gangmo?

36
00:04:16,888 --> 00:04:19,532
I saw it with my own eyes!

37
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:22,847
He must be hiding here somewhere...
We must find him!

38
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:13,195
Seonbaenim.

39
00:05:33,537 --> 00:05:35,033
Who's there?

40
00:06:04,401 --> 00:06:05,397
How did it go?

41
00:06:05,503 --> 00:06:06,877
How did the surgery...

42
00:06:06,986 --> 00:06:09,075
My husband didn't die, right?

43
00:06:09,173 --> 00:06:11,524
He suffered a truly severe 
cerebral hemorrhage.

44
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:14,899
So what...
Can he make it or not?

45
00:06:14,988 --> 00:06:17,908
We'll have to keep him under
observation and wait a little longer.

46
00:06:17,983 --> 00:06:20,580
Aigoo... Save my husband!

47
00:06:20,686 --> 00:06:23,086
You must save him!

48
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,801
<i>Taeseop...</i>

49
00:06:28,407 --> 00:06:31,360
The police investigating
Chairman Hwang Taeseop's assault...

50
00:06:31,489 --> 00:06:34,024
are treating the case as a simple robbery,
and have undertaken an inquiry...

51
00:06:34,176 --> 00:06:36,694
<i>in the neighboring area, 
looking for clues.</i>

52
00:06:36,753 --> 00:06:39,953
<i>They're also looking at released
convicts with similar precedents, and...</i>

53
00:06:40,047 --> 00:06:43,681
<i>and searching for 
any possible eye-witness.

54
00:06:43,844 --> 00:06:45,668
<i>It's me, Gangmo.</i>

55
00:06:55,362 --> 00:06:57,144
Things are taking a turn for the worse.

56
00:06:57,273 --> 00:07:00,594
Go Jaechun has seen your face.

57
00:07:01,288 --> 00:07:03,416
Jo Pilyeon is behind this.

58
00:07:05,087 --> 00:07:09,903
I'm sure that Go Jaechun had been 
following me from the hospital.

59
00:07:10,149 --> 00:07:12,324
He might have been masking his face,

60
00:07:12,466 --> 00:07:15,090
but they seemed to be 
wearing similar clothes...

61
00:07:17,972 --> 00:07:19,396
By any chance...

62
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,490
It wasn't you, was it?

63
00:07:23,329 --> 00:07:24,188
What?

64
00:07:24,329 --> 00:07:28,294
Jo Pilyeon would have no reason 
to attack Chairman Hwang.

65
00:07:28,861 --> 00:07:30,948
The fact their relationship
suddenly deteriorated...

66
00:07:31,045 --> 00:07:36,093
So you're suggesting I
created a rift between the two?

67
00:07:36,987 --> 00:07:38,657
And if I did?

68
00:07:39,172 --> 00:07:40,681
Hyung...

69
00:07:42,516 --> 00:07:44,410
We did promise we'd avenge our father,

70
00:07:44,528 --> 00:07:46,057
but this was not the way I intended.

71
00:07:46,282 --> 00:07:47,881
I know.

72
00:07:48,154 --> 00:07:54,107
How much you want to fight and defeat 
Manbo Construction fair and square.

73
00:07:56,272 --> 00:07:58,142
It wasn't me.

74
00:07:59,648 --> 00:08:03,643
Creating dissent between the two, 
leading to bloodshed...

75
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:06,866
That's not my style.

76
00:08:11,878 --> 00:08:13,278
That's right, Hyung.

77
00:08:13,772 --> 00:08:16,997
We can't do things like
Hwang Taeseop and Jo Pilyeon.

78
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,338
Only then will Dad accept all this.

79
00:08:26,067 --> 00:08:29,211
<i>But I don't agree with you, Gangmo.</i>

80
00:08:29,422 --> 00:08:34,281
<i>Those bastards killed
our father with no mercy.</i>

81
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,987
<i>An eye for an eye,</i>

82
00:08:37,182 --> 00:08:39,199
<i>and a tooth for a tooth.</i>

83
00:08:39,864 --> 00:08:42,940
<i>Revenge should be taken all the way.</i>

84
00:08:52,575 --> 00:08:54,387
<i>I shouldn't be here.</i>

85
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,386
Better wake up before it's too late.

86
00:08:56,475 --> 00:08:59,253
Mom... What's wrong?

87
00:08:59,908 --> 00:09:03,060
If your father dies like that,
what will that make of us?

88
00:09:03,272 --> 00:09:05,696
He even changed his testament.

89
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:11,796
I must see what he changed firsthand.

90
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,845
If things really go astray,

91
00:09:14,351 --> 00:09:18,093
your father's death might
spell the end for the two of us.

92
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:08,777
Dad.

93
00:10:11,141 --> 00:10:13,177
Please, wake up.

94
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,642
I don't even have Gangmo
by my side anymore.

95
00:10:18,501 --> 00:10:21,336
If even you leave me,

96
00:10:22,418 --> 00:10:25,371
how am I supposed to go on?

97
00:10:27,807 --> 00:10:31,607
Wake up, Dad.

98
00:10:34,438 --> 00:10:37,572
Dad...

99
00:10:51,757 --> 00:10:54,546
<i>Trying to avoid the problem
won't solve anything.</i>

100
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,828
<i>If Jo Pilyeon found out about me,</i>

101
00:10:58,537 --> 00:11:01,381
<i>then it's time to walk out of
the shadows and fight him off.</i>

102
00:11:03,358 --> 00:11:05,405
<i>The real war starts now,</i>

103
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,477
<i>Jo Pilyeon.</i>

104
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,758
<i>I apologize.</i>

105
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:18,070
I should have personally 
verified his body...

106
00:11:18,405 --> 00:11:21,199
I did feel strange about it.

107
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:23,811
The mudflats in Gaepo, that is.

108
00:11:24,075 --> 00:11:27,917
That James Lee 
was Lee Gangmo, after all.

109
00:11:28,823 --> 00:11:31,764
Seeing how Lee Gangmo 
rescued Hwang Taeseop,

110
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:36,301
Chairman Hwang might be the one
who got him out of the Samcheong camp.

111
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:43,972
It's now clear that Chairman Hwang was
plotting to stab me in the back all along.

112
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:47,772
But who did that to Chairman Hwang?

113
00:11:47,865 --> 00:11:49,534
<i>I'm sure they'll soon catch him.</i>

114
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:53,984
The newspaper was 
talking of a simple robbery?!

115
00:11:54,628 --> 00:11:58,598
Shouldn't we find Lee Gangmo
and send him back to prison?

116
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:00,521
<i>That's natural.</i>

117
00:12:00,705 --> 00:12:02,341
He still hasn't 
served his full sentence,

118
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:04,282
so this is jailbreaking, 
pure and simple.

119
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:08,682
Seongmo, you find his
whereabouts and catch him.

120
00:12:08,964 --> 00:12:10,411
All right.

121
00:12:14,111 --> 00:12:15,462
Ahh... Jaechun.

122
00:12:15,628 --> 00:12:16,793
Yes.

123
00:12:18,828 --> 00:12:22,544
You said Lee Daesoo's son
witnessed his death, right?

124
00:12:22,638 --> 00:12:23,981
Yes.

125
00:12:24,981 --> 00:12:29,081
According to Hwang Taeseop,
Lee Daesoo's son has shown up.

126
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:31,796
It's likely that we're
dealing with the same guy.

127
00:12:31,993 --> 00:12:34,511
I'm sure he'll be around
Hwang Taeseop in some way,

128
00:12:34,605 --> 00:12:35,930
so look into it.

129
00:12:36,111 --> 00:12:37,617
All right.

130
00:12:53,543 --> 00:12:57,727
Yes... Director Park Sotae's
workplace, Hangang Construction.

131
00:12:58,355 --> 00:12:59,348
<i>It's me, Sotae.</i>

132
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:00,566
Ohh... Gangmo!

133
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,284
Are things in Seoul going well?

134
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:04,699
<i>Pack up and come up to 
Seoul right away.</i>

135
00:13:04,896 --> 00:13:06,399
Right now?

136
00:13:06,657 --> 00:13:08,751
All right!

137
00:13:09,645 --> 00:13:10,728
Hyungnim.

138
00:13:10,822 --> 00:13:12,134
Pack your things.

139
00:13:12,235 --> 00:13:13,639
Why? Did it go well in Seoul?

140
00:13:13,732 --> 00:13:16,794
Looks like we'll get ourselves 
a huge building over there?

141
00:13:16,951 --> 00:13:19,825
Ahh... I'll finally hear people
call me director for real.

142
00:13:19,918 --> 00:13:23,275
Really? Then Gangmo must have 
really hit it big this time.

143
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:24,345
Wait... Let me think.

144
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:26,875
I'll be picking all
female employees personally.

145
00:13:26,971 --> 00:13:29,871
Forget credentials!
If they're pretty, they're in.

146
00:13:29,949 --> 00:13:31,954
- Nice body? You're hired!
- Hey... Hey!

147
00:13:36,472 --> 00:13:38,397
Pack your things, for starters.

148
00:13:38,578 --> 00:13:40,966
Now that Jo Pilyeon has
found out you're alive,

149
00:13:41,225 --> 00:13:42,542
I don't think you 
should remain in Seoul.

150
00:13:42,648 --> 00:13:45,564
If I keep hiding,
I'll get you into trouble as well.

151
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,070
So?

152
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:50,693
If your identity is exposed, 
you'll have to...

153
00:13:50,928 --> 00:13:52,517
go back to prison.

154
00:13:52,752 --> 00:13:53,858
Don't worry, Hyung.

155
00:13:54,093 --> 00:13:56,046
I have a plan.

156
00:14:08,805 --> 00:14:11,529
Did you bring 
the chairman's testament?

157
00:14:11,693 --> 00:14:13,308
Didn't I tell you already?

158
00:14:13,418 --> 00:14:15,167
Before the chairman passes away,

159
00:14:15,258 --> 00:14:16,505
I can't reveal its content 
no matter what.

160
00:14:16,576 --> 00:14:19,187
Listen, Mister Kim!

161
00:14:21,305 --> 00:14:23,658
Let's negotiate.

162
00:14:23,846 --> 00:14:25,086
Negotiate, you said?

163
00:14:25,261 --> 00:14:28,892
If you show me that testament
and make the changes I ask,

164
00:14:28,986 --> 00:14:30,520
I'll give you five percent 
of my holdings.

165
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:35,344
Everyone knows about the
chairman's condition by now,

166
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:39,215
and changing a testament which 
has gone through authentication...

167
00:14:39,297 --> 00:14:40,615
is no easy task.

168
00:14:40,756 --> 00:14:45,827
Then, if the chairman passes away, 
you'll proceed as it states?

169
00:14:46,038 --> 00:14:49,156
The issue is, 
for how long he will brave it out.

170
00:14:49,486 --> 00:14:52,302
If only he doesn't end up 
dying right away,

171
00:14:52,526 --> 00:14:56,114
I'm sure there will be 
a way to solve this?!

172
00:14:56,244 --> 00:14:59,535
What does that statement say?

173
00:14:59,785 --> 00:15:00,808
What?

174
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:03,770
What were those changes about?

175
00:15:07,393 --> 00:15:09,217
Leave us alone.

176
00:15:11,134 --> 00:15:12,380
I said get out of here.

177
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:14,264
How can you scream in here?

178
00:15:14,424 --> 00:15:15,693
We're in Intensive Care.

179
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:17,413
He's my husband.

180
00:15:17,778 --> 00:15:23,001
This mortifies and unnerves me 
even more than you, got it?

181
00:15:38,823 --> 00:15:41,082
Hey, Hwang Taeseop.

182
00:15:42,423 --> 00:15:44,800
Don't die on me,
and survive at all cost.

183
00:15:45,242 --> 00:15:47,635
<i>Whatever it takes, survive.</i>

184
00:15:48,494 --> 00:15:53,590
You haven't shown a shred of
affection for me all these years.

185
00:15:54,225 --> 00:15:59,095
But now you're going to
abandon Jeongshik and me,

186
00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:02,566
and force us to live on the street?

187
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,191
<i>You can't die that way.</i>

188
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:10,375
After I've changed the testament,

189
00:16:12,693 --> 00:16:14,634
then you can die.

190
00:16:16,422 --> 00:16:18,159
If you do it then,

191
00:16:20,734 --> 00:16:23,300
I won't try to stop you.

192
00:16:29,851 --> 00:16:32,599
Here... Calm down, gentlemen.
Please, calm down!

193
00:16:32,669 --> 00:16:35,025
So tell us what on earth is going on.

194
00:16:35,187 --> 00:16:36,959
It's just as I told you.

195
00:16:37,128 --> 00:16:39,003
Nothing will happen, 
so just calm down.

196
00:16:39,113 --> 00:16:41,437
Are we in any position
to be calm about this?

197
00:16:41,531 --> 00:16:43,573
You said you're a chief, right?

198
00:16:43,815 --> 00:16:47,874
Tell someone in charge 
to come instead!

199
00:17:04,747 --> 00:17:06,230
I apologize for being late.

200
00:17:06,335 --> 00:17:09,476
What is Chairman Hwang's condition?

201
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:11,857
Is he still unconscious?

202
00:17:11,951 --> 00:17:14,151
You don't need to worry.

203
00:17:14,382 --> 00:17:16,739
He just regained his senses.

204
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,431
<i>Look, Director Hwang!</i>

205
00:17:19,547 --> 00:17:22,956
If you're lying to us,
it'll be trouble for you!

206
00:17:23,098 --> 00:17:28,980
The chairman made Manbo Construction
what it is today with his bare hands.

207
00:17:29,262 --> 00:17:34,745
He also managed to overcome odds 
people thought impossible.

208
00:17:34,874 --> 00:17:42,651
Does that look like the kind of man
who would die on the street just like that?

209
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:45,639
If that's really what you believed,

210
00:17:45,969 --> 00:17:49,964
sell all your shares right away.

211
00:17:50,564 --> 00:17:53,494
Forget everything else, 
but as the heir of this company,

212
00:17:53,576 --> 00:17:58,576
I can't accept shareholders
who don't believe in our founder.

213
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:03,708
So you're positive that he
regained his consciousness.

214
00:18:03,813 --> 00:18:06,149
He looked and smiled at me.

215
00:18:06,466 --> 00:18:07,938
And held my hand.

216
00:18:08,043 --> 00:18:13,407
Then again, 
people don't die that easily.

217
00:18:13,557 --> 00:18:18,121
After all, we're talking about
Chairman Hwang Taeseop here.

218
00:18:48,834 --> 00:18:50,964
You must have been worried, I bet?

219
00:18:51,269 --> 00:18:53,528
You might fool everyone else,

220
00:18:53,952 --> 00:18:55,928
but not me.

221
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:03,581
Is there a chance the chairman 
might never wake up again?

222
00:19:08,546 --> 00:19:12,661
Back in the day,
because of an accident,

223
00:19:13,014 --> 00:19:15,979
everyone proclaimed me dead as well.

224
00:19:19,478 --> 00:19:23,579
But there was something 
I cherished so much,

225
00:19:23,955 --> 00:19:27,035
I couldn't possibly die, and that 
same thing brought me back to life.

226
00:19:27,788 --> 00:19:32,223
Chairman Hwang is not the kind
of man who would leave you behind.

227
00:19:32,376 --> 00:19:34,717
I can guarantee you that.

228
00:19:35,729 --> 00:19:38,684
He will wake up for sure.

229
00:20:16,918 --> 00:20:19,200
Is this the "huge building"?

230
00:20:19,295 --> 00:20:20,789
And where are all our employees?

231
00:20:20,895 --> 00:20:24,024
Hey Gangmo, did you call us here 
to live in this place?

232
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:25,024
Just for the time being.

233
00:20:25,142 --> 00:20:27,137
Be that as it may, this...

234
00:20:27,266 --> 00:20:28,895
Grown-ass men 
sharing the same room...

235
00:20:28,965 --> 00:20:32,597
Still better than the barracks 
at the Samcheong camp!

236
00:20:32,688 --> 00:20:34,341
Do we get running water?

237
00:20:34,437 --> 00:20:35,948
- Where is the toilet?
- There, behind you.

238
00:20:36,054 --> 00:20:38,636
Aigoo... Aigoo...
He's in heaven, and stuff.

239
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:41,887
Do we really have to stay
all three in this rathole...

240
00:20:44,828 --> 00:20:46,594
Sotae.

241
00:20:47,892 --> 00:20:49,598
We have a little problem.

242
00:20:49,892 --> 00:20:51,848
Problem? What problem?

243
00:20:51,939 --> 00:20:56,351
Jo Pilyeon found out I'm alive.

244
00:20:56,974 --> 00:20:57,953
What?

245
00:20:58,092 --> 00:21:00,289
Then you shouldn't have 
told us to come here!

246
00:21:00,399 --> 00:21:01,729
If we run away now,

247
00:21:01,847 --> 00:21:05,136
all we've achieved with the company 
will vanish into thin air.

248
00:21:05,494 --> 00:21:07,231
Then, what now?

249
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,488
I'll have to meet Jo Pilyeon.

250
00:21:11,614 --> 00:21:13,317
Are you out of your mind?

251
00:21:13,517 --> 00:21:14,982
Come with me.

252
00:21:15,178 --> 00:21:17,072
All I need is your help.

253
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:31,119
You have visitors.

254
00:21:32,437 --> 00:21:34,215
Politicians?

255
00:21:34,329 --> 00:21:36,653
I've never seen them here before.

256
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:01,696
A surprising visit, indeed.

257
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:04,095
We'll have to speak elsewhere.

258
00:22:04,204 --> 00:22:06,509
Here is perfectly fine with me.

259
00:22:06,727 --> 00:22:10,317
And since we're here, might as well 
record our conversation.

260
00:22:14,873 --> 00:22:18,837
I could send you 
back to prison right now.

261
00:22:18,929 --> 00:22:24,225
Jo Minwoo and Hwang Jeongshik 
will go there before I ever do.

262
00:22:24,413 --> 00:22:25,625
What?

263
00:22:27,201 --> 00:22:29,131
How have you been?

264
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:36,288
I could tell everyone in court
that Gangmo wasn't a murderer?!

265
00:22:36,935 --> 00:22:39,088
Or should I just do it here?

266
00:22:39,982 --> 00:22:42,841
Who was it again who
killed Chairman Hong...

267
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,135
Listen, Warden.

268
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,123
<i>Yes?</i>

269
00:22:45,337 --> 00:22:48,082
If you don't mind,
leave us alone a moment.

270
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,219
Go ahead.

271
00:22:56,383 --> 00:22:58,842
Hwang Jeongshik was the killer,

272
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:01,972
and since Jo Minwoo 
ordered my murder...

273
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:04,397
Abetment to murder.

274
00:23:04,548 --> 00:23:07,280
I'm quite familiar with the concept.

275
00:23:07,913 --> 00:23:09,370
So?

276
00:23:09,489 --> 00:23:13,654
Why didn't you just head for 
the station, and came to me instead?

277
00:23:13,877 --> 00:23:20,854
The way I see it, you should be
the one running away from me,

278
00:23:22,262 --> 00:23:24,591
so things felt a little upside down.

279
00:23:24,697 --> 00:23:26,356
What?!

280
00:23:26,991 --> 00:23:30,639
What are you trying to say?

281
00:23:31,968 --> 00:23:34,003
Lee Daesoo.

282
00:23:36,089 --> 00:23:42,266
The man you and Chairman Hwang killed,
to get your hands on those gold bars.

283
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,231
That man...

284
00:23:48,316 --> 00:23:50,069
was my father.

285
00:23:54,046 --> 00:23:57,728
You said you're 
enjoying your time here.

286
00:23:59,681 --> 00:24:04,621
So what would be the point of revenge, 
if prison was the end result?

287
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:17,772
Don't act cocky with me, kid.

288
00:24:20,683 --> 00:24:25,189
So, what, you've been hiding 
like a rat all this time,

289
00:24:25,358 --> 00:24:30,329
and now that you fear you might be 
exposed, you come out of your hole?

290
00:24:30,498 --> 00:24:32,310
In your dreams.

291
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:35,898
I kept a low profile all this time
because I didn't have the power,

292
00:24:36,192 --> 00:24:40,969
but now I'm more 
than capable of facing you.

293
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:46,001
You're going to 
throw down the gauntlet?

294
00:24:48,113 --> 00:24:50,781
Guess you're banking on 
that land in Gaepo,

295
00:24:50,988 --> 00:24:55,914
but do you really think you can
beat me with a handful of soil?

296
00:24:56,357 --> 00:24:58,126
You can bet on it.

297
00:24:58,618 --> 00:25:04,937
And that's because cowardice
won't pave the way to my success.

298
00:25:06,431 --> 00:25:12,264
You'll soon find out
how powerful a weapon...

299
00:25:13,969 --> 00:25:16,381
playing fair and square can be.

300
00:25:16,631 --> 00:25:20,702
Is that the reason you
assaulted Chairman Hwang?

301
00:25:20,908 --> 00:25:21,789
What?

302
00:25:21,932 --> 00:25:26,791
Was trying to strangle Hwang Taeseop 
from behind "fair and square"?

303
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:33,650
And how do you know he was 
being strangled from behind?

304
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:40,192
I knew it... It was you.

305
00:25:40,333 --> 00:25:43,403
Think we don't 
read newspapers in here?

306
00:25:43,545 --> 00:25:48,559
The man who assaulted
Hwang Taeseop wasn't me,

307
00:25:48,715 --> 00:25:50,821
it was none other than you.

308
00:25:51,527 --> 00:25:56,209
Without a shred of evidence,
who is ever going to believe you?

309
00:25:58,021 --> 00:26:02,660
Weren't you the first to go on
a rampage to avenge your father?!

310
00:26:06,425 --> 00:26:11,731
Guess I'll have to call Miss Jeongyeon 
and tell her the good news.

311
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:45,246
Minwoo.

312
00:26:47,023 --> 00:26:50,117
What are you doing here at this hour?

313
00:26:51,999 --> 00:26:53,749
Where's your house?

314
00:26:53,941 --> 00:26:55,047
What?

315
00:26:55,823 --> 00:26:58,388
Why are you asking?

316
00:27:00,821 --> 00:27:03,842
There's nothing to eat.

317
00:27:04,659 --> 00:27:07,058
Here... Fresh water.

318
00:27:18,991 --> 00:27:20,026
Here.

319
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:23,085
Glutinous rice cakes?!

320
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,697
Just to wish you good luck 
for tomorrow's test.

321
00:27:28,826 --> 00:27:30,414
You can make it, right?

322
00:27:31,414 --> 00:27:32,467
No idea.

323
00:27:32,573 --> 00:27:34,406
I'm so nervous, it's killing me.

324
00:27:34,483 --> 00:27:37,467
What if I suddenly forget everything?

325
00:27:41,361 --> 00:27:45,432
Why are you suddenly...
taking that off?

326
00:27:46,412 --> 00:27:48,866
So we can go over it one last time.

327
00:27:49,188 --> 00:27:50,865
Go get your textbooks.

328
00:27:51,065 --> 00:27:53,518
It's late, you don't need to bother.

329
00:27:53,635 --> 00:27:56,103
Want to flunk your test?

330
00:27:56,197 --> 00:27:57,867
Get ready.

331
00:28:01,261 --> 00:28:02,780
Hello?

332
00:28:02,879 --> 00:28:04,543
<i>It's me, Miju.</i>

333
00:28:04,744 --> 00:28:06,261
Big Op...

334
00:28:08,085 --> 00:28:09,838
<i>The test is tomorrow, right?</i>

335
00:28:10,085 --> 00:28:12,637
<i>Should have at least
bought you some taffy...</i>

336
00:28:12,743 --> 00:28:13,953
<i>Should I come now?</i>

337
00:28:14,058 --> 00:28:17,453
No... I need to sleep early.

338
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,411
Who's calling?

339
00:28:20,084 --> 00:28:21,875
A friend.

340
00:28:23,013 --> 00:28:26,057
Can't we meet after the test?

341
00:28:26,211 --> 00:28:28,654
I just feel sorry, that's all.

342
00:28:28,843 --> 00:28:30,553
<i>Nah... It's all right.</i>

343
00:28:30,647 --> 00:28:33,230
<i>Then, I'll call you soon.</i>

344
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:34,937
All right.

345
00:28:35,207 --> 00:28:37,136
Good luck tomorrow.

346
00:28:52,717 --> 00:28:54,515
You got this wrong again.

347
00:28:54,606 --> 00:28:57,379
It's the same one 
you got wrong last time.

348
00:28:59,152 --> 00:29:01,159
Did you learn the formula or not?

349
00:29:01,265 --> 00:29:02,579
I told you I did...

350
00:29:02,687 --> 00:29:05,515
Then apply it, will you?

351
00:29:07,056 --> 00:29:08,903
Here, look.

352
00:29:17,982 --> 00:29:18,982
Here...

353
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,770
So...

354
00:29:32,827 --> 00:29:34,203
What is it?

355
00:29:34,297 --> 00:29:36,780
Aren't you going to show me?

356
00:29:37,874 --> 00:29:39,474
Listen.

357
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,264
Don't you have longer pants at home?

358
00:29:42,373 --> 00:29:43,819
Uh?

359
00:29:44,748 --> 00:29:47,101
Go put on some pants.

360
00:29:48,042 --> 00:29:51,013
It's hot, why would I put pants on?

361
00:29:51,277 --> 00:29:55,307
It's so damn hot in here...

362
00:29:55,477 --> 00:29:59,229
See? You're feeling the same.

363
00:30:02,417 --> 00:30:05,982
I'm going to explain to you 
one more time, so listen well.

364
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:09,625
So what you do here...

365
00:30:15,832 --> 00:30:19,009
You made me forget it!

366
00:30:19,926 --> 00:30:21,268
Give it to me.

367
00:30:21,503 --> 00:30:24,666
I can just look at 
the answers by myself.

368
00:30:25,879 --> 00:30:30,913
I'll go freshen up, so you better
solve them all before I'm back, got it?

369
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:56,212
Why is it so damn hot...

370
00:30:56,459 --> 00:30:59,087
Am I the only one feeling this way?

371
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:03,074
It's not like I can 
take off my shirt, either.

372
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:30,064
<i>- Name: Lee Miju -</i>

373
00:32:09,134 --> 00:32:10,493
How did it go?

374
00:32:10,652 --> 00:32:11,918
Did you go well?

375
00:32:12,024 --> 00:32:13,789
I think it might have gone well,

376
00:32:13,942 --> 00:32:16,071
but I don't really know
if I got them all right.

377
00:32:16,219 --> 00:32:17,715
You brought the test with you, right?

378
00:32:17,826 --> 00:32:19,118
Give it to me.

379
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:21,015
Here?

380
00:33:07,696 --> 00:33:09,057
Minwoo...

381
00:33:09,149 --> 00:33:10,625
You...

382
00:33:12,296 --> 00:33:15,002
must be out of your mind.

383
00:33:15,345 --> 00:33:17,320
You've gone crazy.

384
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:20,712
I'm sorry.

385
00:33:21,112 --> 00:33:25,806
You did so much to help me...

386
00:33:27,465 --> 00:33:30,765
Still, I gave my best.

387
00:33:30,858 --> 00:33:32,301
You...

388
00:33:33,454 --> 00:33:35,572
What if you end up on top of the list?

389
00:33:35,784 --> 00:33:37,207
What?

390
00:33:39,195 --> 00:33:41,902
You might end up first.

391
00:33:42,666 --> 00:33:44,835
Minwoo...

392
00:33:45,004 --> 00:33:49,557
You didn't just guess 
some of them right, did you?

393
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:54,016
You mean it?
You aren't lying, right?!

394
00:33:54,122 --> 00:33:56,677
Ehh... You did it.

395
00:34:00,395 --> 00:34:02,665
Look... You two!

396
00:34:03,642 --> 00:34:06,454
What are you two doing here?

397
00:34:08,312 --> 00:34:10,989
Hurry up and leave!

398
00:34:11,377 --> 00:34:13,730
I'm sorry.

399
00:34:14,153 --> 00:34:16,271
<i>I said leave!</i>

400
00:34:31,085 --> 00:34:34,320
<i>We need to go somewhere together.</i>

401
00:34:34,508 --> 00:34:38,976
<i>And you'll get to meet
a very welcome person.</i>

402
00:34:48,164 --> 00:34:49,329
Yes.

403
00:34:49,552 --> 00:34:51,394
<i>It's me, Shideok.</i>

404
00:34:51,676 --> 00:34:53,112
Where are you now?

405
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,959
<i>At the hospital.</i>

406
00:34:55,171 --> 00:34:56,518
How about Chairman Hwang?

407
00:34:57,488 --> 00:34:59,534
<i>Still the same.</i>

408
00:35:00,818 --> 00:35:02,852
Who is there with him?

409
00:35:03,011 --> 00:35:04,628
<i>Just me.</i>

410
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:07,122
<i>Jeongyeon said she's not coming today.</i>

411
00:35:07,863 --> 00:35:09,592
All right.

412
00:35:10,873 --> 00:35:14,257
Aren't you sleeping?

413
00:35:14,969 --> 00:35:16,545
I need to go somewhere.

414
00:35:16,705 --> 00:35:19,844
Will it be all right?

415
00:35:20,663 --> 00:35:26,004
You've always liked
Chairman Hwang's daughter.

416
00:35:26,345 --> 00:35:31,356
If Jo Pilyeon frames you for
what happened to her father...

417
00:35:31,452 --> 00:35:36,124
All that has nothing to do with me.

418
00:35:38,947 --> 00:35:42,508
Just admit you're struggling, 
why hide it?

419
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:46,069
You can't even sleep because of that...

420
00:35:57,882 --> 00:35:59,611
Gangmo!

421
00:36:29,086 --> 00:36:30,780
Agasshi...

422
00:36:32,975 --> 00:36:34,916
You said you wouldn't come.

423
00:36:35,011 --> 00:36:36,434
What are you doing here at this hour?

424
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:39,952
My dad is still the same, right?

425
00:36:40,519 --> 00:36:43,293
Yes, no changes.

426
00:36:44,789 --> 00:36:46,831
<i>Agasshi...</i>

427
00:36:46,999 --> 00:36:50,243
I... Right...
I had something to tell you.

428
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:52,945
Let's go have some coffee.

429
00:36:53,046 --> 00:36:54,830
What's wrong with you?

430
00:36:55,069 --> 00:36:56,312
Did anything happen to my father?

431
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:57,778
No...

432
00:36:57,975 --> 00:37:00,469
It's not that...

433
00:37:04,822 --> 00:37:08,876
<i>I never wanted to 
see you in this state.</i>

434
00:37:09,417 --> 00:37:11,241
<i>Open your eyes.</i>

435
00:37:11,555 --> 00:37:18,147
<i>If you die now, I'll always remain
a poor little servant to you.</i>

436
00:37:19,323 --> 00:37:23,554
<i>Wake up and look at me.</i>

437
00:37:23,939 --> 00:37:27,215
<i>Look at the son of the man you killed,</i>

438
00:37:27,521 --> 00:37:30,097
<i>look at Lee Gangmo!</i>

439
00:37:31,215 --> 00:37:37,061
<i>Get up and ask for forgiveness 
with some dignity!</i>

440
00:37:56,246 --> 00:37:57,281
Shideok...

441
00:37:57,446 --> 00:37:59,040
Shideok!

442
00:38:12,137 --> 00:38:14,219
Please, move out of the way.

443
00:38:23,002 --> 00:38:24,857
Dad...

444
00:38:26,396 --> 00:38:29,022
<i>Dad... Dad!</i>

445
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,196
Dad, wake up!

446
00:38:30,278 --> 00:38:32,196
- Please, leave.
- Dad!

447
00:38:32,349 --> 00:38:34,960
You can't die on me, Dad!

448
00:38:35,219 --> 00:38:37,584
<i>Seonsaengnim, my father
will be all right, isn't it?</i>

449
00:38:37,643 --> 00:38:38,651
Dad!

450
00:38:38,744 --> 00:38:40,177
Dad!!

451
00:38:40,275 --> 00:38:42,267
Dad, wake up!

452
00:38:42,362 --> 00:38:44,295
Dad...

453
00:38:51,585 --> 00:38:53,423
It was just a temporary shock.

454
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:56,703
Thankfully, he's out of danger.

455
00:39:01,644 --> 00:39:03,425
Dad.

456
00:39:08,011 --> 00:39:08,870
Gang...

457
00:39:08,987 --> 00:39:10,870
Gangmo?!

458
00:39:26,291 --> 00:39:27,492
Shideok.

459
00:39:27,603 --> 00:39:30,503
I didn't see things, did I?

460
00:39:31,338 --> 00:39:32,481
Where is Gangmo?

461
00:39:32,632 --> 00:39:34,177
I asked you where's Gangmo.

462
00:39:34,269 --> 00:39:36,610
You know that!

463
00:39:37,009 --> 00:39:39,250
I'm sure I saw him, I did!

464
00:39:39,338 --> 00:39:41,634
Where is Gangmo?

465
00:40:25,483 --> 00:40:27,519
Gangmo...

466
00:40:29,472 --> 00:40:31,942
It's you.

467
00:40:34,613 --> 00:40:36,865
Right?

468
00:40:38,666 --> 00:40:41,242
Gangmo...

469
00:40:50,241 --> 00:40:52,477
Seeing you alive...

470
00:40:55,418 --> 00:40:57,771
Gangmo...

471
00:40:59,241 --> 00:41:01,794
At least you become stronger.

472
00:41:05,182 --> 00:41:08,759
Only if you become
stronger than your father...

473
00:41:10,253 --> 00:41:12,782
will you be able to fight me off.

474
00:41:13,229 --> 00:41:15,155
Gangmo.

475
00:41:16,756 --> 00:41:19,034
What's wrong with you?

476
00:41:19,956 --> 00:41:22,862
Should I make it 
even easier to understand?

477
00:41:24,721 --> 00:41:26,956
From now on in,

478
00:41:28,168 --> 00:41:30,669
you and I are enemies.

479
00:41:33,586 --> 00:41:36,269
Or else, you will never be able...

480
00:41:36,657 --> 00:41:42,344
to protect Manbo Construction from me.

481
00:41:52,654 --> 00:41:54,810
Gangmo...

482
00:41:55,498 --> 00:41:57,345
Gangmo!

483
00:42:01,498 --> 00:42:03,639
James Lee.

484
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:08,251
My name...

485
00:42:09,991 --> 00:42:12,136
is not Lee Gangmo.

486
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,379
It's James Lee.

487
00:42:26,946 --> 00:42:27,913
Agasshi!

488
00:42:27,986 --> 00:42:29,702
Agasshi.

489
00:42:50,678 --> 00:42:53,278
Have some of this.

490
00:42:57,654 --> 00:42:59,572
Shideok.

491
00:43:00,478 --> 00:43:03,003
You know, right?

492
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:10,862
That Gangmo wouldn't just act 
like that for no reason.

493
00:43:14,191 --> 00:43:20,588
There is no way you wouldn't know 
why he's doing this to me.

494
00:43:25,388 --> 00:43:27,644
Tell me, Shideok.

495
00:43:28,773 --> 00:43:30,832
<i>Or else...</i>

496
00:43:31,291 --> 00:43:34,750
I think my heart 
is just going to explode.

497
00:43:37,044 --> 00:43:40,385
Why is Gangmo acting like that?

498
00:43:46,269 --> 00:43:48,280
Gangmo's father...

499
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:51,962
was killed by the chairman.

500
00:43:54,156 --> 00:43:57,874
<i>Because of the chairman
and Jo Minwoo's father,</i>

501
00:43:58,290 --> 00:44:00,769
he ended up dying.

502
00:44:08,026 --> 00:44:12,909
And now I think I
should leave you as well.

503
00:44:13,638 --> 00:44:17,368
<i>Gangmo tells me to stay by
your side and take care of you,</i>

504
00:44:18,026 --> 00:44:21,667
but I think I'll just go back to him.

505
00:44:49,546 --> 00:44:50,473
I apologize.

506
00:44:50,593 --> 00:44:52,594
Forgive me.

507
00:44:53,048 --> 00:44:54,674
Sorry again.

508
00:44:55,527 --> 00:44:59,358
Anyhow, young brats these days...

509
00:45:17,289 --> 00:45:18,869
Have you been waiting for long?

510
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:22,394
Hey... How many times
did I tell you not to be late?

511
00:45:22,503 --> 00:45:25,042
Sorry... The bus was late today.

512
00:45:25,195 --> 00:45:27,500
So you were riding the bus 
dressed like that?

513
00:45:27,712 --> 00:45:28,620
I'm hungry.

514
00:45:28,711 --> 00:45:30,724
What will you buy me today?

515
00:45:34,218 --> 00:45:35,524
Waiter.

516
00:45:36,512 --> 00:45:39,667
<i>- Shall we have meat?
- Yes.</i>

517
00:45:39,774 --> 00:45:42,721
We can just choose a kind
of steak from this menu, then.

518
00:45:42,815 --> 00:45:44,124
Myeongja.

519
00:45:44,286 --> 00:45:47,263
Isn't that your son Minwoo?

520
00:45:47,722 --> 00:45:52,189
<i>So is that the daughter of
Hwaseong Electric's chairman?</i>

521
00:45:53,169 --> 00:45:54,332
Listen...

522
00:45:54,445 --> 00:45:57,904
Let's go to the
Chinese restaurant next door.

523
00:45:58,186 --> 00:45:59,450
Go ahead first.

524
00:45:59,537 --> 00:46:03,006
Why? You were the first inviting
us here because of their steak?

525
00:46:03,110 --> 00:46:06,227
Go ahead first and
order whatever you want.

526
00:46:06,392 --> 00:46:07,618
I'll be there in a moment.

527
00:46:07,714 --> 00:46:08,510
Come on.

528
00:46:08,616 --> 00:46:12,510
- Sorry.
- All right, then. Make it quick.

529
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:30,576
Mom.

530
00:46:35,098 --> 00:46:36,898
Sit down.

531
00:46:40,757 --> 00:46:44,840
What clan are you from?

532
00:46:45,028 --> 00:46:46,346
What?

533
00:46:46,647 --> 00:46:48,012
Listen, Mom...

534
00:46:48,106 --> 00:46:50,459
I'm asking about your clan.

535
00:46:51,094 --> 00:46:53,106
My clan?

536
00:46:53,882 --> 00:46:57,741
I'm a Lee.

537
00:46:57,917 --> 00:47:00,547
Who asked you to tell me your name?

538
00:47:01,135 --> 00:47:04,099
What do your parents do for a living?

539
00:47:06,817 --> 00:47:09,535
They both passed away.

540
00:47:10,464 --> 00:47:12,833
Let's talk at home, Mom.

541
00:47:13,379 --> 00:47:15,904
What college are you frequenting?

542
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:20,668
If you're not in college, 
are you working?

543
00:47:20,845 --> 00:47:22,774
Stop it, Mom!

544
00:47:23,045 --> 00:47:26,050
I will soon get my GED.

545
00:47:26,932 --> 00:47:28,073
Mom.

546
00:47:28,214 --> 00:47:29,708
What are you, a beggar?

547
00:47:29,838 --> 00:47:33,535
You dare stick around my son?

548
00:47:33,648 --> 00:47:34,876
What's wrong with you?

549
00:47:34,985 --> 00:47:36,908
I ought to...

550
00:47:37,755 --> 00:47:38,956
Leave.

551
00:47:39,109 --> 00:47:40,674
Do it!

552
00:47:42,522 --> 00:47:43,488
Minwoo...

553
00:47:43,566 --> 00:47:44,509
Minwoo, you!

554
00:47:44,603 --> 00:47:48,309
You gave up on Hwaseong Electric's heir 
just because of that brat?

555
00:47:48,403 --> 00:47:50,476
<i>Is that it?</i>

556
00:47:52,523 --> 00:47:55,049
Couldn't you at least let me 
deal with my own marriage?

557
00:47:55,213 --> 00:47:58,860
You're not suggesting
you'll marry her, are you?

558
00:47:58,943 --> 00:48:01,143
And why not?

559
00:48:01,366 --> 00:48:03,910
Do you realize what situation 
your father is in right now?

560
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:05,486
Please, give it a rest!

561
00:48:05,563 --> 00:48:07,951
You'll never convince him.

562
00:48:08,152 --> 00:48:12,717
When you gave up your MBA in the
States to become a film director,

563
00:48:12,858 --> 00:48:15,720
have you forgotten what
your father did to you?

564
00:48:15,929 --> 00:48:20,562
I could never cope with
something so terrible again.

565
00:48:20,772 --> 00:48:24,048
Minwoo, if you really think 
you can win him over...

566
00:48:24,185 --> 00:48:25,515
Minwoo!

567
00:48:25,856 --> 00:48:27,585
Minwoo!

568
00:48:47,494 --> 00:48:49,000
<i>Miju.</i>

569
00:48:50,517 --> 00:48:52,576
<i>Hey, Lee Miju!</i>

570
00:48:55,423 --> 00:48:57,296
<i>Open the door!</i>

571
00:49:02,238 --> 00:49:04,167
Miju...

572
00:49:07,591 --> 00:49:09,473
Were you crying?

573
00:49:10,226 --> 00:49:11,904
No.

574
00:49:16,434 --> 00:49:19,716
And I promised you I
wouldn't make you cry again...

575
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:23,954
I'm sorry.

576
00:49:24,809 --> 00:49:26,875
It's all right.

577
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:33,197
Also, clear your 
mother's misunderstanding.

578
00:49:33,938 --> 00:49:39,337
Tell her that there's 
nothing between us.

579
00:49:39,987 --> 00:49:40,634
What?

580
00:49:40,729 --> 00:49:43,752
I'm tired.
Please, go back home.

581
00:49:44,976 --> 00:49:46,014
Come with me.

582
00:49:46,105 --> 00:49:47,088
What's wrong with you?

583
00:49:47,168 --> 00:49:49,193
I said come!

584
00:50:05,323 --> 00:50:06,629
You can find your way 
here again, right?

585
00:50:06,711 --> 00:50:07,770
<i>Yes.</i>

586
00:50:08,058 --> 00:50:08,974
That'll do.

587
00:50:09,053 --> 00:50:10,723
Let's go home.

588
00:50:30,481 --> 00:50:32,986
What's wrong with you, really?

589
00:50:33,669 --> 00:50:34,991
What did I do?

590
00:50:35,084 --> 00:50:39,728
We even kissed, but now... What?

591
00:50:40,186 --> 00:50:42,962
There is nothing between us?

592
00:50:43,869 --> 00:50:49,411
You said you like me.

593
00:50:49,563 --> 00:50:52,069
When have I ever said that?

594
00:50:52,328 --> 00:50:52,959
What?

595
00:50:53,077 --> 00:50:58,081
I have never said those words.

596
00:50:58,783 --> 00:51:00,183
Then...

597
00:51:01,432 --> 00:51:04,736
Do you kiss men you dislike?

598
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:09,203
You did that all on your own.

599
00:51:11,133 --> 00:51:17,462
I don't want to put you 
in trouble anymore.

600
00:51:18,744 --> 00:51:21,392
You and I...

601
00:51:22,649 --> 00:51:25,686
live in different worlds.

602
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:27,898
So?

603
00:51:30,498 --> 00:51:32,550
You know?

604
00:51:32,976 --> 00:51:39,162
I think everyone should be 
with someone who suits them.

605
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:41,574
<i>{\a6}*"Birds of a feather flock together"
(rough meaning from Hanja)</i>

606
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:41,574
Yuyusanjoong*.

607
00:51:41,656 --> 00:51:43,532
Don't you know?

608
00:51:43,635 --> 00:51:47,481
What?! Yuyusanjoong?!

609
00:51:49,211 --> 00:51:53,881
Wow... I see your studies
have started making a mark.

610
00:51:57,305 --> 00:51:59,349
Ajumma, another bottle of soju here.

611
00:51:59,423 --> 00:52:00,517
<i>Yes.</i>

612
00:52:00,592 --> 00:52:05,643
Marry whomever 
your family wants you to.

613
00:52:05,896 --> 00:52:08,032
I'll get going.

614
00:52:08,283 --> 00:52:10,420
Sit.

615
00:52:14,394 --> 00:52:17,641
Don't drink too much.

616
00:52:18,041 --> 00:52:20,453
It's bad for your health.

617
00:52:25,776 --> 00:52:27,788
Lee Miju.

618
00:52:41,467 --> 00:52:44,864
Let's stop meeting.

619
00:52:45,039 --> 00:52:47,946
I'm never going to see you again.

620
00:52:51,013 --> 00:52:54,355
Who are you, 
to turn me down twice?

621
00:52:55,155 --> 00:52:58,802
Who the hell are you, 
to dump me twice?

622
00:53:00,044 --> 00:53:02,413
You silly...

623
00:53:02,613 --> 00:53:05,395
I don't need anything else, 
just trust me!

624
00:53:05,478 --> 00:53:09,360
But why don't you get that?

625
00:53:09,642 --> 00:53:12,854
All I need is you, you fool!

626
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:29,300
If you do this a third time,

627
00:53:33,113 --> 00:53:36,102
I will not forgive you.

628
00:54:00,391 --> 00:54:03,697
Come on in, Congressman.
You're late?!

629
00:54:04,613 --> 00:54:09,979
Seems like Jo Pilyeon
might be released earlier.

630
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:18,533
A few congressmen
wrote a petition in his favor.

631
00:54:18,662 --> 00:54:22,238
I did hear that a few congressmen
had been visiting him, but...

632
00:54:22,356 --> 00:54:27,197
I think you better get
ready for some fireworks.

633
00:54:27,703 --> 00:54:29,530
What are you trying to say?

634
00:54:29,617 --> 00:54:34,753
If anything, Jo Pilyeon will have
spent all this time plotting revenge,

635
00:54:34,961 --> 00:54:37,894
think he'll come out
willing to forgive and forget?

636
00:54:38,059 --> 00:54:41,071
I don't know who will be on 
the receiving end of his revenge,

637
00:54:41,284 --> 00:54:44,494
but I'm sure he'll be
furious and ready to fight.

638
00:54:57,467 --> 00:54:59,979
I was surprised to 
hear about your father.

639
00:55:00,097 --> 00:55:01,834
Tell me, how is he doing?

640
00:55:01,928 --> 00:55:06,181
He's neither getting better nor worse.

641
00:55:07,545 --> 00:55:11,039
Who do you believe was behind this?

642
00:55:11,334 --> 00:55:15,915
You think it's a simple robbery 
like the police suggest?

643
00:55:16,503 --> 00:55:20,679
I didn't come here to discuss that.

644
00:55:21,691 --> 00:55:24,503
There was something I'd like to ask you.

645
00:55:26,961 --> 00:55:36,620
Were you and Dad the ones 
who killed Gangmo's father?

646
00:55:39,537 --> 00:55:41,843
Answer me.

647
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:44,764
Is that true?

648
00:55:46,011 --> 00:55:49,270
Even if it was,

649
00:55:49,447 --> 00:55:53,799
I don't believe anyone would be 
stupid enough to admit it?

650
00:55:56,932 --> 00:55:59,026
So it is true.

651
00:55:59,873 --> 00:56:01,861
Who did you hear that from?

652
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:04,120
Lee Gangmo, by any chance?

653
00:56:04,402 --> 00:56:11,624
What is the reason
you did something like that?

654
00:56:11,710 --> 00:56:14,712
If you really did 
hear it from Lee Gangmo,

655
00:56:15,202 --> 00:56:17,630
ever entertained the thought
that he might be responsible...

656
00:56:17,842 --> 00:56:20,865
for what happened to your father?

657
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:24,475
If I were him,

658
00:56:24,724 --> 00:56:31,734
I'd likely plot some kind of retaliation
against the man who killed my father?!

659
00:56:39,416 --> 00:56:41,840
Careful, Jeongyeon.

660
00:56:42,207 --> 00:56:47,979
You never know when Lee Gangmo
might visit that hospital room again.

661
00:57:01,432 --> 00:57:03,326
Please, move out of the way.

662
00:57:07,890 --> 00:57:10,585
Your father is still alive,

663
00:57:10,796 --> 00:57:13,635
why wouldn't he try everything 
to get things done?

664
00:57:13,788 --> 00:57:16,471
Don't you agree, Jeongyeon?

665
00:57:21,729 --> 00:57:23,718
I will soon be released.

666
00:57:23,918 --> 00:57:28,557
I'll have to visit your
father one of these days.

667
00:57:58,679 --> 00:58:02,985
Is Gangmo Oppa really here?

668
00:58:14,767 --> 00:58:17,410
Ohh... Don't put them here, that way.

669
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:19,850
Ahh... Isn't this too small?

670
00:58:19,943 --> 00:58:24,715
If the president's one is
so small, how about ours?

671
00:58:24,845 --> 00:58:26,588
It's just the name
that changes, you fool.

672
00:58:26,665 --> 00:58:28,421
As if "Park Sotae" would sound 
any better stretched wide.

673
00:58:28,504 --> 00:58:31,969
Aigoo... 
Why, Nam Youngchul is any better?

674
00:58:32,313 --> 00:58:34,043
<i>Oppa!</i>

675
00:58:34,690 --> 00:58:35,791
Oppa!

676
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:37,808
Gangmo Oppa!

677
00:58:38,633 --> 00:58:40,632
I missed you!

678
00:58:40,721 --> 00:58:41,584
How have you been?

679
00:58:41,643 --> 00:58:46,150
Ehh... And what's all this
vulgar material on display?!

680
00:58:46,311 --> 00:58:50,143
Introduce yourselves.
They'll be working with us.

681
00:58:50,659 --> 00:58:53,169
I'm Shideok. Yeom Shideok.

682
00:58:53,342 --> 00:58:56,036
Ahh... Shideok or whatever,

683
00:58:56,201 --> 00:59:00,437
what is he, "Director of 
Belly-Stuffing Operations"?

684
00:59:00,696 --> 00:59:03,701
My brother does stuff his belly a lot.

685
00:59:03,798 --> 00:59:07,190
I'm Managing Director Park Sotae.

686
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:10,984
You have a fantastic body, if I may say.

687
00:59:11,082 --> 00:59:15,292
Oppa... Did you hire all these
strange-looking people on purpose?

688
00:59:15,389 --> 00:59:18,511
Then again, he does 
look peculiar, indeed.

689
00:59:18,598 --> 00:59:20,261
You're no joke, either...

690
00:59:20,402 --> 00:59:21,496
Ohh... Look at him...

691
00:59:21,637 --> 00:59:23,945
Back off...

692
00:59:26,543 --> 00:59:28,309
Yes? Hangang Construction.

693
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:32,839
<i>It's me, Hwang Jeongyeon.
Let's meet this evening.</i>

694
00:59:33,117 --> 00:59:35,415
<i>I have something to talk about.</i>

695
00:59:43,225 --> 00:59:46,111
Why isn't he coming?

696
00:59:54,714 --> 00:59:57,108
- Honey!
- Director!

697
00:59:59,826 --> 01:00:01,514
Dad.

698
01:00:40,399 --> 01:00:42,835
Congratulations on your release.

699
01:00:43,129 --> 01:00:46,306
Thanks.
May I see your father?

700
01:00:46,482 --> 01:00:48,153
Certainly.

701
01:01:17,766 --> 01:01:19,919
Are you starting to understand now?

702
01:01:20,143 --> 01:01:23,366
What the price 
to pay for betraying me is.

703
01:01:37,380 --> 01:01:40,027
Take a good look, Chairman Hwang.

704
01:01:40,843 --> 01:01:46,533
At how my son Minwoo devours Manbo 
Construction while you're not around.

705
01:02:30,753 --> 01:02:33,530
What are you doing here?

706
01:02:34,341 --> 01:02:37,024
I'm meeting someone.

707
01:03:11,912 --> 01:03:16,394
I think I can understand how you feel.

708
01:03:17,173 --> 01:03:21,990
But I doubt you'd know what I'm feeling.

709
01:03:23,755 --> 01:03:27,308
How it feels to be betrayed 
by the man you loved.

710
01:03:27,567 --> 01:03:29,637
I couldn't care less what you feel.

711
01:03:29,814 --> 01:03:32,162
You'll have to start caring.

712
01:03:33,704 --> 01:03:37,892
Since I finally found
a reason to fight you off.

713
01:04:00,110 --> 01:04:02,782
<i>The man who did that to my father...</i>

714
01:04:03,038 --> 01:04:07,288
<i>Lee Gangmo, I know it was you.</i>

715
01:04:09,570 --> 01:04:13,156
You're free to think whatever you want.

716
01:04:13,650 --> 01:04:18,567
Since my goal is and will always be 
defeating Manbo Construction.

717
01:04:18,932 --> 01:04:24,109
You avenged your father, right?

718
01:04:26,098 --> 01:04:30,675
So now it's time for me 
to avenge mine.

719
01:04:32,428 --> 01:04:35,440
Don't ever forgive my father.

720
01:04:36,875 --> 01:04:39,510
Since, I myself...

721
01:04:40,486 --> 01:04:43,004
will never forgive you.

So you want me to get
Hangang Construction that permit?

729
01:05:11,217 --> 01:05:15,158
With Jo Pilyeon entering the scene,
they might refuse to comply.

730
01:05:15,311 --> 01:05:20,292
Take a look at this newspaper,
it proves your responsibility for this all.

731
01:05:20,461 --> 01:05:22,145
<i>Leave... Get the hell out!</i>

732
01:05:22,241 --> 01:05:25,925
You've been prancing around with
my money pretending to be a president.

733
01:05:26,012 --> 01:05:27,082
Isn't that fraud?

734
01:05:27,176 --> 01:05:28,000
<i>I can't wait,</i>

735
01:05:28,082 --> 01:05:31,482
<i>to see how you 
destroy Hwang Jeongyeon.</i>
