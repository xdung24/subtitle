- Episode 31 -

4
00:00:10,516 --> 00:00:13,054
<i>The man who did that to my father...</i>

5
00:00:13,257 --> 00:00:17,143
<i>Lee Gangmo, I know it was you.</i>

6
00:00:19,551 --> 00:00:23,373
You're free to think whatever you want.

7
00:00:24,303 --> 00:00:28,936
Since my goal is and will always be
defeating Manbo Construction.

8
00:00:29,096 --> 00:00:34,318
You avenged your father, right?

9
00:00:36,283 --> 00:00:40,123
So now it's time for me to avenge mine.

10
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:45,148
Don't ever forgive my father.

11
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,688
Since, I myself...

12
00:00:50,372 --> 00:00:53,220
will never forgive you.

13
00:00:56,116 --> 00:01:01,966
I've been trying to avenge you all this time, 
running around like a lunatic.

14
00:01:03,626 --> 00:01:05,546
But...

15
00:01:05,807 --> 00:01:09,474
Seeing what a fool you made out of me 
is almost too embarrassing to bear.

16
00:01:10,678 --> 00:01:16,867
If I think of all the time I wasted
thinking about you and our memories,

17
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,345
I get chills down my spine.

18
00:01:21,113 --> 00:01:22,615
Know that?

19
00:01:22,819 --> 00:01:25,211
Done talking, yet?

20
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:29,169
I'll get going, then.

21
00:01:29,462 --> 00:01:32,749
I still need to wrap up
a few things at the office.

22
00:01:33,506 --> 00:01:35,674
When did it start?

23
00:01:35,951 --> 00:01:42,070
Did you come into our family with
revenge in mind from the very beginning?

24
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:53,089
After which you pretended to be a
friend, a companion and a lover to me?

25
00:01:54,856 --> 00:02:02,257
If you really had a shred
of consideration for me,

26
00:02:02,752 --> 00:02:05,342
whatever could have possibly happened,

27
00:02:05,589 --> 00:02:08,413
you first would have come to me.

28
00:02:11,007 --> 00:02:16,930
Because I abandoned both my
father and all my ambitions,

29
00:02:18,152 --> 00:02:20,816
and chose you instead.

30
00:02:21,136 --> 00:02:25,796
You still have feelings left for me?

31
00:02:25,971 --> 00:02:27,135
What?

32
00:02:27,339 --> 00:02:33,262
All that this looks like to me is someone 
drowning herself in petty nostalgia.

33
00:02:35,415 --> 00:02:38,588
Just resent me and get it over with.

34
00:02:39,796 --> 00:02:42,199
Stop dwelling on the past.

35
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,364
I'll get going,

36
00:02:49,509 --> 00:02:51,910
Miss Hwang Jeongyeon.

37
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:55,694
So the reason you want
to join the committee...

38
00:02:55,898 --> 00:03:00,491
is to get yourself that construction
permit for your apartments?

39
00:03:03,577 --> 00:03:09,878
You'll have to pry that
from my cold, dead hands.

40
00:03:10,183 --> 00:03:13,916
If you've got what it takes
to stop me, you're free to try.

41
00:03:15,064 --> 00:03:17,291
<i>I can't wait.</i>

42
00:04:37,029 --> 00:04:39,282
<i>- Will you Marry Me? -</i>

43
00:05:05,903 --> 00:05:08,358
<i>Throw it away with all
your strength, Jeongyeon.</i>

44
00:05:08,518 --> 00:05:13,487
<i>Let it drown along with all 
the feelings you have left for me.</i>

45
00:05:14,361 --> 00:05:16,085
<i>Only then...</i>

46
00:05:16,551 --> 00:05:19,127
<i>Only then will it 
stop hurting you so bad.</i>

47
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,276
So I hear Lee Gangmo is alive.

48
00:06:08,023 --> 00:06:10,281
Why, didn't know yet?

49
00:06:10,676 --> 00:06:13,954
James Lee was Lee Gangmo, after all.

50
00:06:14,784 --> 00:06:19,633
Seems like Lee Gangmo bears quite
the grudge against Hwang Taeseop.

51
00:06:19,948 --> 00:06:24,916
He'll do everything in his power to
bring forth Manbo Construction's downfall.

52
00:06:25,309 --> 00:06:27,579
<i>All you need to do is
take advantage of that,</i>

53
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:31,204
and devour that company with one blow.

54
00:06:31,553 --> 00:06:36,186
Couldn't you just stop trying to
get your hands on Manbo Construction?

55
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,433
What?

56
00:06:37,578 --> 00:06:41,493
- Not only it will be no laughing matter...
- Have you already forgotten...

57
00:06:41,697 --> 00:06:44,083
who made Manbo Construction 
what it is today?

58
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:47,508
What are you trying to imply with that?

59
00:06:47,882 --> 00:06:51,712
You'll soon be presented
with a crucial opportunity.

60
00:06:51,872 --> 00:06:55,467
All you need to do is 
prepare to take advantage of it.

61
00:06:55,996 --> 00:07:00,066
Don't tell me you were involved...

62
00:07:01,381 --> 00:07:04,964
with what happened to Chairman Hwang?

63
00:07:08,556 --> 00:07:11,582
You can be honest with me.

64
00:07:11,815 --> 00:07:14,173
Were you behind that?

65
00:07:15,366 --> 00:07:19,334
Are you that curious about it?

66
00:07:21,204 --> 00:07:24,151
It was an act of God.

67
00:07:26,246 --> 00:07:29,681
He gave us this golden
opportunity on a silver platter.

68
00:07:29,848 --> 00:07:35,349
So can we just turn
our backs and ignore it?

69
00:07:43,531 --> 00:07:45,125
What?!

70
00:07:46,101 --> 00:07:48,530
G...Gangmo is... is alive?!

71
00:07:48,691 --> 00:07:51,863
Didn't you say you met James Lee?

72
00:07:53,952 --> 00:07:54,890
Shall we go,

73
00:07:54,992 --> 00:07:58,722
- President James Lee?
- Sotae!

74
00:07:59,175 --> 00:08:02,347
- Good night to you!
- Sotae!

75
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,740
Park Sotae, that lying son of a...

76
00:08:07,492 --> 00:08:09,986
My suspicions were right.

77
00:08:10,742 --> 00:08:13,682
The man who set his sights 
on Manbo Construction...

78
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:16,630
was Lee Gangmo.

79
00:08:19,069 --> 00:08:22,903
So why did my father
do that with his testament...

80
00:08:23,092 --> 00:08:24,460
What?

81
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:28,884
Ohh... Never mind.
It's nothing.

82
00:08:38,257 --> 00:08:42,506
So that's what your hands looked like.

83
00:08:44,901 --> 00:08:49,414
Every time I asked 
to cut your nails for you,

84
00:08:49,661 --> 00:08:54,332
you'd always rebuff me,
saying it was corny.

85
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,141
But only now...

86
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,085
you finally start 
feeling like my husband.

87
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:05,407
Because the only way
I can hold your hands...

88
00:09:05,582 --> 00:09:08,652
is if you end up in this state.

89
00:09:11,028 --> 00:09:14,328
I sure wasn't blessed with luck.

90
00:09:15,707 --> 00:09:17,879
Don't you agree, Honey?

91
00:09:22,642 --> 00:09:24,316
Honey.

92
00:09:25,014 --> 00:09:27,023
You just moved that, didn't you?

93
00:09:27,284 --> 00:09:29,074
Right?

94
00:09:36,016 --> 00:09:38,123
Honey...

95
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:40,772
Can you see me?

96
00:09:41,209 --> 00:09:43,493
Can you see me, Honey?

97
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,649
<i>Mental paralysis?</i>

98
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:52,879
There's a very strong possibility.

99
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:54,888
But is he conscious?

100
00:09:55,048 --> 00:09:57,915
He will be able to see and hear, 
in all likelihood.

101
00:09:58,089 --> 00:10:01,698
And when will he recover?
Are there good chances that he will?

102
00:10:01,838 --> 00:10:03,983
There are instances of full recoveries,

103
00:10:04,143 --> 00:10:07,345
but the very opposite 
is much more likely.

104
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,490
We really can't be sure.

105
00:10:14,706 --> 00:10:16,176
<i>Mom.</i>

106
00:10:16,859 --> 00:10:17,952
Jeongshik.

107
00:10:18,112 --> 00:10:22,427
Call our lawyer and tell him your father
has just regained his consciousness.

108
00:10:22,965 --> 00:10:24,057
Dad has woken up?

109
00:10:24,173 --> 00:10:25,454
Do it!

110
00:10:25,846 --> 00:10:28,102
All right, Mom.

111
00:10:44,661 --> 00:10:48,427
If you really can hear my voice,

112
00:10:48,733 --> 00:10:51,207
look at me just once.

113
00:10:59,074 --> 00:11:05,204
You know that this is the first time 
you do something nice for me?

114
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:10,879
I will change that testament of yours.

115
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:16,139
Guess you'll hate me even more, now?

116
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:18,948
You'll curse the ground I walk on.

117
00:11:19,923 --> 00:11:21,756
But...

118
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:24,274
that is certainly not
going to surprise me.

119
00:11:24,638 --> 00:11:26,937
I've gotten used to it already.

120
00:11:54,049 --> 00:11:59,139
<i>- Construction Committee MOU -
Approval</i>

121
00:11:59,725 --> 00:12:04,407
<i>The chairman wished for
Gangmo to join the committee.</i>

122
00:12:05,035 --> 00:12:09,704
And I'd like you to respect
your father's wishes.

123
00:12:10,478 --> 00:12:14,230
The first to throw down
the gauntlet was Gangmo.

124
00:12:14,478 --> 00:12:17,456
And I have no intention
of letting him defeat me.

125
00:12:38,979 --> 00:12:43,679
I'm asking you to reject President 
Lee Gangmo's acceptance into the committee.

126
00:12:44,087 --> 00:12:47,928
You're going to manage
that company from now on,

127
00:12:48,219 --> 00:12:52,287
so I trust you're aware that a company's
foremost goal is the pursuit of profits.

128
00:12:52,462 --> 00:12:57,221
If President Lee can't benefit
from the committee's joint liability,

129
00:12:57,614 --> 00:13:01,266
he'll be forced to sell his land
in Gaepo-Dong at bargain prices.

130
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:09,390
I will offer you the chance to join me
in the joint purchase of that land.

131
00:13:11,035 --> 00:13:14,993
But you can't be sure President Lee 
will sell that land to us.

132
00:13:15,168 --> 00:13:20,014
Commissioner Han 
already gave me his word.

133
00:13:21,149 --> 00:13:26,556
That should President Lee Gangmo
fail to obtain that joint liability,

134
00:13:26,832 --> 00:13:30,223
he would give me the construction
permit for that Gaepo-Dong lot.

135
00:13:30,354 --> 00:13:32,275
What the...

136
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,603
<i>If you manage to 
build apartments in Gaepo,</i>

137
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,071
the profits will make what you're
earning through President Lee's...

138
00:13:38,182 --> 00:13:40,471
highway project pale in comparison.

139
00:13:40,616 --> 00:13:44,385
<i>I'm sure you know that 
even better than me.</i>

140
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,179
Director Ju?

141
00:13:53,801 --> 00:13:58,954
It's an MOU for our joint
purchase of the Gaepo land.

142
00:14:21,378 --> 00:14:26,253
President Lee must not be
informed of this until voting day.

143
00:14:26,675 --> 00:14:30,116
Only that way will we
avoid any complication.

144
00:14:38,891 --> 00:14:40,762
<i>Come on in.</i>

145
00:14:41,321 --> 00:14:43,444
- Let me pour you a drink.
- Yes.

146
00:14:43,604 --> 00:14:49,759
I owe you my gratitude for helping
overturn my conviction at the appeal.

147
00:14:50,632 --> 00:14:55,755
But... About the favor
I asked you last time...

148
00:14:55,915 --> 00:15:00,278
You said you'd like to join the consultation
panel for the Ministry of Construction, right?

149
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:03,053
Yes. 
Congressman.

150
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:05,600
But that's just a 
non-permanent consulting post.

151
00:15:05,687 --> 00:15:08,074
Just an honorary post 
and nothing more, you know?

152
00:15:08,248 --> 00:15:10,504
It's all right.

153
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,386
May I ask you the reason?

154
00:15:24,652 --> 00:15:28,436
Isn't that post just a formality
without any power or retribution?

155
00:15:28,581 --> 00:15:31,851
Those chairmen of the 
construction committee betrayed me.

156
00:15:31,982 --> 00:15:37,984
Shouldn't I first deal with them, if I
want to pave the way for the next elections?

157
00:15:38,109 --> 00:15:41,820
The idea that power only comes from
high-ranking appointments is obsolete.

158
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:44,337
You just wait.

159
00:15:44,468 --> 00:15:47,388
You'll see how even a seemingly
insignificant post can do wonders,

160
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:49,964
depending on who's appointed.

161
00:16:07,143 --> 00:16:09,047
Wait for me here.

162
00:16:09,156 --> 00:16:11,086
<i>Yes.</i>

163
00:16:23,957 --> 00:16:26,490
Wow... Looks tasty.

164
00:16:32,281 --> 00:16:34,479
Who is it?

165
00:16:37,053 --> 00:16:39,995
I was about to have some ramen...

166
00:16:41,259 --> 00:16:43,473
Minwoo, you still haven't had din...

167
00:16:50,253 --> 00:16:52,581
Do I have to keep standing here?

168
00:16:52,756 --> 00:16:55,213
Come on in.

169
00:17:17,054 --> 00:17:20,313
How far did you and Minwoo go?

170
00:17:20,444 --> 00:17:22,045
What?

171
00:17:23,159 --> 00:17:25,756
- We're just...
- No.

172
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:29,330
No need to answer me,
I don't even want to know.

173
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:37,392
You know that someone like you shouldn't 
even dream of dating Minwoo, right?

174
00:17:37,938 --> 00:17:39,900
Do you, or not?

175
00:17:40,024 --> 00:17:41,057
I do.

176
00:17:41,163 --> 00:17:42,786
You do?

177
00:17:42,909 --> 00:17:45,405
If you do, then why do you 
keep sticking to him?

178
00:17:45,532 --> 00:17:50,218
So, what, is an orphan like you trying
to marry Minwoo and hit the jackpot?

179
00:17:50,713 --> 00:17:52,925
You're barking up the wrong tree.

180
00:17:53,056 --> 00:17:56,723
I don't know what 
you did to seduce my son,

181
00:17:56,898 --> 00:18:00,740
but Minwoo would never be miserable 
enough to fall for someone like you.

182
00:18:01,191 --> 00:18:03,010
<i>{\a6}*used for close acquaintances'
mothers, or mothers-in-law</i>

183

- What?

184
00:18:03,126 --> 00:18:04,407
"Mother"?!

185
00:18:04,567 --> 00:18:07,681
How dare you call me that, 
you insolent brat?

186
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:09,518
Ajumma...

187
00:18:09,627 --> 00:18:11,072
What?!

188
00:18:11,283 --> 00:18:13,226
Ajumma?!

189
00:18:14,128 --> 00:18:15,907
I'll finish eating dinner.

190
00:18:16,067 --> 00:18:18,770
The ramen will get all bloated.

191
00:18:21,344 --> 00:18:22,398
Hey!

192
00:18:22,529 --> 00:18:24,682
Who taught you to act like this?

193
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:26,371
This is my house.

194
00:18:26,487 --> 00:18:29,486
You're the one who forced
your way in at dinner time.

195
00:18:32,307 --> 00:18:33,529
You!

196
00:18:33,718 --> 00:18:36,181
Let's make things clear right here.

197
00:18:36,614 --> 00:18:41,344
You'll stop meeting Minwoo, right?

198
00:18:44,298 --> 00:18:46,103
Why aren't you answering?

199
00:18:46,306 --> 00:18:50,079
You'll break up with him right away.

200
00:18:50,594 --> 00:18:52,713
I don't know if I can.

201
00:18:53,172 --> 00:18:54,605
You what?

202
00:18:54,852 --> 00:18:58,738
I was told that 
I shouldn't lie to elders.

203
00:18:58,942 --> 00:19:03,179
To be really honest, I don't think
I'd be able to break up right away.

204
00:19:04,459 --> 00:19:05,682
You little wench!

205
00:19:05,754 --> 00:19:07,705
Are you trying to make fun of me?

206
00:19:07,908 --> 00:19:10,135
So? You won't break up?

207
00:19:10,251 --> 00:19:11,561
What's wrong with you?

208
00:19:11,648 --> 00:19:12,987
"What's wrong with you"?!

209
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:15,228
You insolent brat...

210
00:19:15,345 --> 00:19:18,692
So, what, are you implying 
you'll marry my son?

211
00:19:18,779 --> 00:19:21,283
- Get up!
- You're hurting me!

212
00:19:21,399 --> 00:19:22,185
Get up!

213
00:19:22,272 --> 00:19:25,823
Uh? Speak to me once and for all!

214
00:19:26,944 --> 00:19:30,364
<i>Why are you doing this...
What did I ever do wrong?</i>

215
00:19:30,531 --> 00:19:31,266
Miju?

216
00:19:31,353 --> 00:19:33,129
<i>Say it!</i>

217
00:19:33,696 --> 00:19:35,624
<i>Please, don't!</i>

218
00:19:35,726 --> 00:19:38,052
Miju, what's wrong?
What's the matter?

219
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,595
<i>This is not your first time, is it?</i>

220
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,341
<i>How much could you
possibly want to stop this?</i>

221
00:19:41,443 --> 00:19:43,859
<i>How much money have you made 
fooling men this way?</i>

222
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:44,834
Mom?!

00:19:44,921 --> 00:19:47,293
<i>Promise you'll break up 
with Minwoo right now.</i>

224
00:19:47,482 --> 00:19:48,865
<i>Do it!</i>

225
00:19:48,996 --> 00:19:51,382
Mom!

226
00:19:59,968 --> 00:20:04,800
So you're going to
keep refusing, aren't you?

227
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:09,107
<i>Fine... 
Let's see how long you last.</i>

228
00:20:09,238 --> 00:20:15,088
<i>Brats like you need to be taught
a lesson before they can wake up.</i>

229
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:19,279
You stubborn wench...

230
00:20:29,554 --> 00:20:33,159
Oppa...

231
00:21:03,188 --> 00:21:05,923
Minwoo...

232
00:21:10,304 --> 00:21:11,934
Don't let that startle you.

233
00:21:12,108 --> 00:21:14,067
I was just doing some housecleaning.

234
00:21:14,154 --> 00:21:17,240
I always tend to go a little
over the top when I clean, so...

235
00:21:17,665 --> 00:21:20,921
Why are you lying to me, you silly?

236
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:27,412
I know that my mother was here.

237
00:21:29,186 --> 00:21:33,206
Did you tell her 
you'd break up with me?

238
00:21:39,303 --> 00:21:41,180
Miju.

239
00:21:41,981 --> 00:21:44,527
I feel terrible about
what happened to you,

240
00:21:44,935 --> 00:21:48,096
- but I...
- I told her I wouldn't.

241
00:21:49,886 --> 00:21:52,578
That I wouldn't be able 
to break up with you.

242
00:21:55,969 --> 00:21:58,879
You told me that if I
dumped you a third time,

243
00:21:59,709 --> 00:22:03,244
this time you wouldn't forgive me.

244
00:22:03,536 --> 00:22:10,040
And since I was afraid 
I'd really end up losing you...

245
00:22:35,017 --> 00:22:37,025
That fool is out of his mind.

246
00:22:37,171 --> 00:22:40,198
How could he go after 
such a lowly wench...

247
00:22:43,181 --> 00:22:44,877
You're back?

248
00:22:45,222 --> 00:22:47,013
Had dinner?

249
00:23:08,539 --> 00:23:09,965
Minwoo...

250
00:23:10,169 --> 00:23:11,973
What are you doing?

251
00:23:12,104 --> 00:23:14,004
The apartment is empty, right?

252
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:17,416
I'll go live there starting today, 
just so you know.

253
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,815
Guess that brat came crying to you?

254
00:23:25,844 --> 00:23:26,858
Minwoo!

255
00:23:27,004 --> 00:23:28,211
What's wrong with you, really?

256
00:23:28,328 --> 00:23:29,710
Want to get on your father's bad side?

257
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,282
You know?

258
00:23:31,588 --> 00:23:34,775
The days when my father could
dictate how I live my life are over.

259
00:23:34,891 --> 00:23:35,924
Minwoo!

260
00:23:36,026 --> 00:23:38,966
Be it marriage or anything else,
I'll deal with that by myself,

261
00:23:39,199 --> 00:23:42,797
so stop trying to interfere 
all the time... Stop it!

262
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,490
Minwoo!

263
00:23:46,217 --> 00:23:48,124
Minwoo!

264

Where are you going at this hour?

265
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:01,282
We were going for some drinks,

266
00:24:01,384 --> 00:24:03,611
care to join us?

267
00:24:05,825 --> 00:24:06,812
What's with him?

268
00:24:06,943 --> 00:24:10,256
I guess something 
happened to him outside.

269
00:24:10,362 --> 00:24:12,255
Minwoo's not the type to react that way.

270
00:24:12,386 --> 00:24:13,267
What's going on?

271
00:24:13,355 --> 00:24:15,168
Honey, it's nothing...

272
00:24:15,277 --> 00:24:19,816
I'll set the table right away,
so wait just a moment.

Yes... Anyhow,

I could buy you that for dinner tonight?

up by the end of the month.

Sotae, you hurry up and
gather men for goods & services.

304
00:26:33,469 --> 00:26:35,302
Focus on those with
construction site experience.

305
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:37,056
All right...

306
00:26:38,397 --> 00:26:42,188
Then, were you accepted
into the committee?

00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:29,180
We will now decide on the motion
regarding Hangang Construction's admission.

321
00:28:29,484 --> 00:28:32,233
<i>You all brought your
admission agreements, right?</i>

322
00:28:32,379 --> 00:28:36,905
<i>Let's just use those
instead of simple voting.</i>

323
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:39,073
First, Chairman Cheon?

324
00:28:39,219 --> 00:28:40,936
I...

325
00:28:42,085 --> 00:28:44,501
approve.

326
00:28:46,717 --> 00:28:48,624
Chairman Baek.

327
00:28:52,684 --> 00:28:54,780
I approve as well.

328
00:29:00,485 --> 00:29:07,384
Chairman Hwang Taeseop expressed
his approval through this agreement.

329
00:29:11,557 --> 00:29:18,357
I think he just wished for the same man he 
once considered like a son to really succeed.

330
00:29:23,476 --> 00:29:26,517
However, I don't agree with him.

331
00:29:32,818 --> 00:29:34,841
I oppose it.

332
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:38,288
Next, Chairman Jo?

333
00:29:38,478 --> 00:29:43,120
I agree with Miss Hwang Jeongyeon.

334
00:29:44,439 --> 00:29:45,710
I oppose this motion.

335
00:29:45,943 --> 00:29:47,791
<i>What?!</i>

336
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:50,280
<i>We have two votes for, and two against.</i>

337
00:29:50,498 --> 00:29:55,044
All that is left now is
Chairman Park's decision.

338
00:29:59,555 --> 00:30:03,295
I oppose it as well.

339
00:30:08,416 --> 00:30:12,647
With this, I declare the motion to accept
Hangang Construction into the committee...

340
00:30:12,751 --> 00:30:14,098
rejected.

341
00:30:14,273 --> 00:30:16,465
Wait... Wait!

342
00:30:19,221 --> 00:30:20,647
Chairman Jo!

343
00:30:21,374 --> 00:30:22,975
Chairman Park!

344
00:30:23,077 --> 00:30:25,741
<i>What are you...</i>

345
00:30:41,674 --> 00:30:43,667
I'll admit it.

346
00:30:45,076 --> 00:30:46,942
This time,

347
00:30:48,726 --> 00:30:50,944
I lost to you.

348
00:30:53,424 --> 00:30:55,528
You're impressive, Hwang Jeongyeon.

349
00:30:55,746 --> 00:31:00,281
Better enjoy the spotlight.

350
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:04,195
Because it won't last very long.

351
00:31:30,523 --> 00:31:33,767
You weren't sleeping, yet?

352
00:31:35,437 --> 00:31:43,140
I'm just back from making
Hangang Construction's motion fail.

353
00:31:44,334 --> 00:31:47,001
I told Gangmo.

354
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:51,629
That I will avenge you with my own hands.

355
00:31:51,963 --> 00:31:54,568
<i>Don't, Jeongyeon...</i>

356
00:31:54,918 --> 00:31:59,051
<i>It wasn't Gangmo who did this to me.</i>

357
00:31:59,196 --> 00:32:05,629
I'll also get back all
the land you gave to him.

358
00:32:07,587 --> 00:32:10,024
You just watch, Dad.

359
00:32:10,897 --> 00:32:15,816
I'll trample down on Lee Gangmo 
with all my strength.

360
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:20,502
<i>Jeongyeon, I said it wasn't him!</i>

361
00:32:20,808 --> 00:32:22,889
<i>If it weren't for Gangmo,</i>

362
00:32:23,034 --> 00:32:26,453
<i>I would have been dead already!</i>

363
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:49,744
<i>- 8th Ministry of Construction
Consultation Panel Meeting -</i>

364
00:32:49,977 --> 00:32:53,933
Why are there still no news about the 
concerns we raised with the minister?

365
00:32:54,166 --> 00:32:57,149
He's currently abroad, so...

366
00:32:57,265 --> 00:32:59,914
<i>So what is it that you people really do?</i>

367
00:33:00,045 --> 00:33:02,737
Aren't you here to
consult with the minister?

368
00:33:02,883 --> 00:33:05,298
Anyhow, this panel is not working!

369
00:33:05,473 --> 00:33:08,000
Have you accomplished
a single thing, all this time?

370
00:33:08,175 --> 00:33:10,940
I apologize.

371
00:33:12,878 --> 00:33:16,193
<i>Ohh... Come on in, Mister Jo.</i>

372
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:18,318
Let me make the introductions.

373
00:33:18,565 --> 00:33:20,996
<i>He recently joined our panel, and...</i>

374
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:23,106
How nice of you to meddle in this...

375
00:33:23,164 --> 00:33:24,758
<i>Tell me about it.</i>

376
00:33:24,933 --> 00:33:27,334
How long has it been
since they released you...

377
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:31,118
So you knew each other already?

378
00:33:31,525 --> 00:33:34,930
I wouldn't say I was proud
to make his acquaintance.

379
00:33:36,434 --> 00:33:40,651
May I have a word in private with them?

380
00:33:41,496 --> 00:33:46,705
If you don't mind, I have to 
tell them something personally.

381
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,456
Certainly.

382
00:33:59,858 --> 00:34:06,421
This is all the data I've been
collecting since my KCIA days.

383
00:34:06,639 --> 00:34:11,402
A look here and you'll find everything
from your personal history...

384
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:15,733
down to every single detail
about your business ventures.

385
00:34:16,329 --> 00:34:18,585
<i>Chairman Cheon...</i>

386
00:34:18,847 --> 00:34:22,965
I see you have your own 
sophisticated approach to tax evasion?!

387
00:34:24,042 --> 00:34:31,442
Also, both Chairmen Park and Baek
have a long history of price fixing.

388
00:34:33,581 --> 00:34:37,402
And I guess because
he's the youngest here,

389
00:34:37,514 --> 00:34:40,730
our dear Chairman Jo seems to exhibit 
quite the controversial lifestyle?!

390
00:34:40,836 --> 00:34:43,928
Not to mention the affair
you've long been hiding.

391
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:50,757
Also, last but not least, 
our eldest here...

392
00:34:50,866 --> 00:34:53,380
Ahh... Chairman Park.

393
00:34:53,564 --> 00:34:56,204
Me?

394
00:34:56,393 --> 00:34:59,784
May I borrow your ear a moment?

395
00:35:22,713 --> 00:35:25,274
Listen, Chairman Cheon.

396
00:35:26,118 --> 00:35:28,199
Wanna die?

397
00:35:30,848 --> 00:35:33,787
Is that what you want?

398
00:35:38,778 --> 00:35:41,209
Shall I get rid of you all?

399
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:53,587
You people betrayed me and went
groveling at Min Honggi's feet.

400
00:35:54,826 --> 00:35:56,963
Open your eyes and take a good look.

401
00:35:57,123 --> 00:36:02,522
This seat you loved to look down on 
is now occupied by Jo Pilyeon!

402
00:36:03,046 --> 00:36:07,047
From here on in, I'll directly
report to the minister on...

403
00:36:07,245 --> 00:36:10,610
every single consultation
regarding your projects.

404
00:36:11,192 --> 00:36:15,907
I'm sure if I tell him I'll tame all the 
complaints of those committee members,

405
00:36:16,067 --> 00:36:20,098
the minister will be ecstatic.

406
00:36:36,047 --> 00:36:37,947
Seonbaenim.

407
00:36:42,752 --> 00:36:45,078
Jo Pilyeon has started making his move.

408
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,111
What?

409
00:36:46,257 --> 00:36:50,157
He's trying to gain control
of the construction sector.

410
00:36:50,797 --> 00:36:54,392
But... That position 
doesn't even allow him that.

411
00:36:54,848 --> 00:36:56,463
He's not even human...

412
00:36:56,667 --> 00:36:58,456
He's the devil!

413
00:36:58,897 --> 00:37:00,436
Seonbaenim.

414
00:37:03,273 --> 00:37:06,911
All it takes to destroy a devil 
is becoming one yourself.

415
00:37:08,375 --> 00:37:11,765
I'll just become an even
scarier monster than Jo Pilyeon,

416
00:37:11,925 --> 00:37:15,592
and squash him like a bug.

417
00:37:35,438 --> 00:37:36,456
Miju.

418
00:37:36,631 --> 00:37:39,498
Ahh... Why isn't this working?!

419
00:37:39,774 --> 00:37:41,739
Hey... Lee Miju.

420
00:37:42,783 --> 00:37:45,330
Stop eating and look at me.

421
00:37:45,841 --> 00:37:47,090
Hey...

422
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,346
You really...

423
00:37:57,712 --> 00:37:59,416
Open it.

424
00:38:06,835 --> 00:38:10,546
Wow... Almost looks real.

425
00:38:11,128 --> 00:38:13,413
Even if a fake, it's still pretty.

426
00:38:14,202 --> 00:38:16,339
It's yours.

427
00:38:17,641 --> 00:38:18,616
What's the occasion?

428
00:38:18,717 --> 00:38:20,478
It's not even my birthday.

429
00:38:20,653 --> 00:38:24,175
Don't you even know what a man 
giving you a ring means?

430
00:38:28,506 --> 00:38:30,912
I don't think I can accept it.

431
00:38:31,741 --> 00:38:37,128
You just rushed into a decision
because your parents are against it.

432
00:38:38,699 --> 00:38:39,682
And?

433
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:44,244
Later, when I become someone
you don't need to be ashamed of,

434
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:47,838
then I want to gain 
your parents' consent.

435
00:38:47,998 --> 00:38:50,031
That is never going to happen.

436
00:38:50,177 --> 00:38:52,869
What do you mean?

437
00:38:54,455 --> 00:38:55,314
Give me your hand.

438
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:58,908
Are you telling me you're just going to
forsake your parents because of me?

439
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:01,077
I said give me your hand.

440
00:39:01,272 --> 00:39:02,197
Minwoo...

441
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:05,503
Let's wait until they
give us their approval.

442
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:08,879
If I keep showing them all the efforts...

443
00:39:10,029 --> 00:39:12,081
Minwoo!

444
00:39:14,249 --> 00:39:17,476
See? Why force it...

445
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:20,070
That's a real diamond.

446
00:39:20,881 --> 00:39:22,057
What?!

447
00:39:22,217 --> 00:39:24,967
Why are you only telling me now?

448
00:39:31,204 --> 00:39:32,520
Have you lost something?

449
00:39:32,637 --> 00:39:33,917
Stay away!

450
00:39:34,048 --> 00:39:36,784
Please, don't come here.

451
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,856
Where did it go?

452
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:55,386
Hey... Is a diamond 
more important than...

453
00:39:55,481 --> 00:39:57,285
I found it!

454
00:39:57,809 --> 00:40:01,418
If I lost it,
I don't know what I'd have done...

455
00:40:09,466 --> 00:40:10,823
<i>Here.</i>

456
00:40:10,968 --> 00:40:14,068
It's expensive,
so take good care of it.

457
00:40:27,267 --> 00:40:29,407
Keep it for the rest of your days.

458
00:40:30,047 --> 00:40:32,739
If you ever take it off, you're dead.

459
00:40:59,963 --> 00:41:01,681
What brings you here?

460
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:03,471
Here.

461
00:41:03,616 --> 00:41:06,017
It's tomorrow's morning edition.

462
00:41:08,477 --> 00:41:11,482
<i>- Expansion of South Seoul
Development Areas Confirmed -</i>

463
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:14,893
<i>- Gaepo chosen as residential area -</i>

464
00:41:18,703 --> 00:41:21,873
I've heard they didn't
accept you into the committee.

465
00:41:22,166 --> 00:41:25,575
<i>All you'll be able to build
in Gaepo are apartments,</i>

466
00:41:25,793 --> 00:41:29,344
but if you can't get a
construction permit, that land...

467
00:41:32,347 --> 00:41:33,526
Yes?

468
00:41:33,715 --> 00:41:36,567
<i>It's me. Hwang Jeongyeon.</i>

469
00:41:36,931 --> 00:41:40,526
<i>Better take good care
of that land in Gaepo.</i>

470
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:46,114
<i>Or else it'll soon start
tearing up like toilet paper.</i>

471
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:51,094
It's the land you got in exchange 
for selling me out.

472
00:41:51,254 --> 00:41:54,033
Think I'll let that alone?

473
00:41:55,561 --> 00:42:00,625
But that's not the only thing 
I've set my eyes on.

474
00:42:00,786 --> 00:42:02,823
It's much more than that.

475
00:42:03,769 --> 00:42:06,661
You better bear that in mind, 
President Lee Gangmo.

476
00:42:17,337 --> 00:42:19,941
What do you plan to do now?

477
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:23,396
All we need is that
joint liability, anyhow.

478
00:42:23,746 --> 00:42:26,452
If I can't obtain it
from the committee members,

479
00:42:26,758 --> 00:42:28,271
I'll have to find another solution.

480
00:42:28,388 --> 00:42:31,444
Unless major players agree 
to sign a joint liability,

481
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:34,282
it will be easier said than done.

482
00:42:50,941 --> 00:42:53,422
President Lee is here, Sir.

483
00:42:56,425 --> 00:42:58,593
Have a seat.

484
00:43:05,578 --> 00:43:11,255
People running a business can end up 
taking backward steps, at times.

485
00:43:11,619 --> 00:43:15,621
But if you let that
setback hold you down,

486
00:43:15,824 --> 00:43:17,862
that's when the real problems begin.

487
00:43:18,051 --> 00:43:19,943
That is never going to happen.

488
00:43:20,059 --> 00:43:25,528
You've been prancing around pretending
to be a president with my money.

489
00:43:25,635 --> 00:43:28,177
If that investment doesn't
bring me any tangible fruits,

490
00:43:28,555 --> 00:43:30,987
wouldn't that be a fraud?

491
00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:33,300
Sir...

492
00:43:34,886 --> 00:43:37,389
Take a good look at this hand.

493
00:43:37,796 --> 00:43:43,031
<i>You wrote on your business plan 
that you'd build apartments.</i>

494
00:43:43,206 --> 00:43:47,557
But if you used that to con me,

495
00:43:47,761 --> 00:43:52,941
your entire body will face the
same fate as this hand of mine.

496
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:09,773
<i>We never even mentioned it.</i>

497
00:44:10,035 --> 00:44:12,683
I don't know who you heard that from,

498
00:44:12,771 --> 00:44:14,574
but we never said we'd sell.

499
00:44:14,621 --> 00:44:19,276
- How many times must I repeat myself?
- I said that's the truth!

500
00:44:19,361 --> 00:44:24,463
- Hello? Hello?
- We're not selling.

501
00:44:25,197 --> 00:44:28,230
I said we're not selling that land!

502
00:44:28,728 --> 00:44:30,863
Who said that nonsense?

503
00:44:31,014 --> 00:44:33,355
We'll soon start 
building apartments there.

504
00:44:33,468 --> 00:44:35,569
<i>What do you think this is, a realtor?</i>

505
00:44:35,682 --> 00:44:37,525
You really...

506
00:44:37,704 --> 00:44:39,379
Who are you calling wench?

507
00:44:39,477 --> 00:44:41,804
How dare you swear at me, you prick?

508
00:44:42,396 --> 00:44:46,716
What?! A penalty?! What penalty?

509
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:52,094
Did you use a single sack
of cement there, or a brick?

510
00:44:52,225 --> 00:44:54,089
Listen to you!

511
00:44:54,165 --> 00:44:58,113
We can just start 
the construction, you fool!

512
00:45:01,697 --> 00:45:05,160
Looks like rumors that we can't build
those apartments started spreading.

513
00:45:05,272 --> 00:45:08,186
Everyone is in a frenzy 
asking us to sell.

514
00:45:09,455 --> 00:45:14,242
Even the subcontractors
said they'll cancel our deal.

515
00:45:19,478 --> 00:45:22,554
<i>Why are you getting angry at me, then?</i>

516
00:45:33,515 --> 00:45:34,615
It's me, Hyung.

517
00:45:35,759 --> 00:45:37,888
I have a little favor to ask you.

518
00:45:47,474 --> 00:45:49,581
Ever since the former regime,

519
00:45:49,684 --> 00:45:52,665
he's been playing a pivotal role in
the government's development planning.

520
00:45:53,079 --> 00:45:56,070
<i>He's like a mentor 
to Commissioner Han.</i>

521
00:46:03,748 --> 00:46:06,393
So you're telling me
those immense mudflats...

522
00:46:06,525 --> 00:46:08,885
will be filled with apartments, right?

523
00:46:09,007 --> 00:46:10,711
Exactly, Congressman.

524
00:46:11,003 --> 00:46:14,210
This land will soon go
through monumental changes.

525
00:46:14,304 --> 00:46:16,119
Monumental...

526
00:46:16,241 --> 00:46:19,617
Just hearing that makes my heart race!

527
00:46:20,563 --> 00:46:22,435
<i>How are you, Sir?</i>

528
00:46:24,138 --> 00:46:27,072
President Lee, 
what are you doing here?

529
00:46:27,538 --> 00:46:28,812
Was just out here taking a breather.

530
00:46:28,934 --> 00:46:30,439
Right...

531
00:46:30,971 --> 00:46:33,455
Those fields belong to you, right?

532
00:46:33,578 --> 00:46:35,214
Who is this fella?

533
00:46:35,336 --> 00:46:36,719
Allow me to introduce myself.

534
00:46:36,813 --> 00:46:39,023
I'm Hangang Construction's
president, Lee Gangmo.

535
00:46:39,201 --> 00:46:40,979
So you run a construction company.

536
00:46:41,110 --> 00:46:44,333
So all that land is yours?

537
00:46:44,455 --> 00:46:46,289
It was confirmed as a residential area,

538
00:46:46,449 --> 00:46:48,320
so he'll soon have to sell it.

539
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,029
<i>If he can't build apartments here,</i>

540
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:55,052
then current policy states he must 
sell it back at bargain prices.

541
00:46:55,974 --> 00:46:58,598
I'd like a word with you, 
Mister Congressman.

542
00:46:58,739 --> 00:47:00,441
<i>It will be no use, President Lee.</i>

543
00:47:00,864 --> 00:47:04,971
We plan to give that construction
permit to Manbo Construction.

544
00:47:05,789 --> 00:47:07,172
Congressman.

545
00:47:07,858 --> 00:47:09,748
Just give me a moment of your time.

546
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,701
Seems like he's here for a "favor."

547
00:47:13,002 --> 00:47:14,591
Let's get going, Commissioner.

548
00:47:14,676 --> 00:47:16,171
Yes.

549
00:47:38,873 --> 00:47:41,468
Despite accepting
plenty of political funding,

550
00:47:41,666 --> 00:47:48,292
he's never once been involved in 
bribing or even doing personal favors.

551
00:47:50,295 --> 00:47:53,285
Convincing him 
is not going to be easy.

552
00:47:54,301 --> 00:47:57,369
You can dig some intel
on Congressman Oh, right?

553
00:47:58,996 --> 00:48:00,764
Help me out, Hyung.

554
00:48:02,157 --> 00:48:07,384
If I can't get past him, it'll be
the end for Hangang Construction.

555
00:48:08,663 --> 00:48:14,230
Congressman Oh Byeongtak has an 
Achilles' heel that can never be brought up.

556
00:48:14,634 --> 00:48:19,608
<i>Even if you do try to convince him, 
don't ever go there.</i>

557
00:48:35,535 --> 00:48:38,139
<i>Hurry up and recover, Chairman.</i>

558
00:48:38,233 --> 00:48:44,515
Seeing how your wife treats
Jeongyeon is just killing me.

559
00:48:44,638 --> 00:48:47,544
Why are you telling him 
that nonsense?

560
00:48:51,877 --> 00:48:53,749
Who are you?

561
00:48:54,003 --> 00:48:55,987
It's you, Ma'am?

562
00:48:57,172 --> 00:48:59,276
I came to see the chairman.

563
00:49:00,292 --> 00:49:02,332
We'll let you two alone, then.

564
00:49:02,445 --> 00:49:04,411
- Follow me.
- Who is she?

565
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:07,152
She's the Royal Club's...

566
00:49:07,317 --> 00:49:09,447
I mean, one of Manbo Construction's 
major shareholders.

567
00:49:09,513 --> 00:49:11,375
Hurry up and come.

568
00:49:11,986 --> 00:49:13,641
Get moving!

569
00:49:31,888 --> 00:49:38,720
<i>I wanted to at least spare you 
from seeing me in this state.</i>

570
00:49:55,490 --> 00:50:00,108
If only for Jeongyeon's sake, 
you must recover.

571
00:50:01,234 --> 00:50:03,935
If you'll spend the
rest of your days in bed,

572
00:50:05,176 --> 00:50:10,885
I think I'm really going 
to resent you until I die.

573
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:13,340
<i>Gyeongok...</i>

574
00:50:20,761 --> 00:50:22,454
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

575
00:50:26,149 --> 00:50:29,121
Is this all you could
do for the chairman?

576
00:50:29,206 --> 00:50:33,864
So, what, were you trying to 
compensate by caressing his face?

577
00:50:34,052 --> 00:50:36,149
Watch what you say.

578
00:50:36,798 --> 00:50:39,365
I wasn't caressing him,
I barely wiped his face.

579
00:50:39,492 --> 00:50:41,204
Who the hell are you?

580
00:50:41,326 --> 00:50:42,360
Excuse me?

581
00:50:42,464 --> 00:50:44,824
What's your relationship with him?

582
00:50:45,765 --> 00:50:47,514
Don't you know that already?

583
00:50:47,758 --> 00:50:49,090
As one of Manbo Construction's
major shareholders...

584
00:50:49,175 --> 00:50:50,999
<i>You own a night club!</i>

585
00:50:51,075 --> 00:50:52,937
So, what, were you having an affair?

586
00:50:53,031 --> 00:50:54,611
Mom!

587
00:50:54,742 --> 00:50:56,266
Are you done?

588
00:50:56,510 --> 00:50:58,147
Answer me.

589
00:50:58,346 --> 00:51:01,046
What is with you?

590
00:51:02,297 --> 00:51:05,925
Guess I'll have to summon a
shareholders' meeting tomorrow.

591
00:51:06,034 --> 00:51:07,244
What?!

592
00:51:07,771 --> 00:51:11,545
Let's see what happens to you when I
tell everyone the chairman might die...

593
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:13,266
because of the treatment
you're giving him here.

594
00:51:13,651 --> 00:51:16,350
<i>After stocks crash to the bottom and
shareholders ask for those responsible,</i>

595
00:51:16,445 --> 00:51:19,059
think you're going 
to survive that meeting?

596
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,325
- I really ought to...
- Mom!

597
00:51:21,409 --> 00:51:27,503
Ma'am... She's easily upset these days, 
so please be understanding.

598
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:29,854
Start by taking care 
of the chairman for real.

599
00:51:30,033 --> 00:51:34,464
Or else, this won't just end
with me selling my shares,

600
00:51:34,661 --> 00:51:37,953
and I might just force Manbo
Construction into the pits of hell.

601
00:51:45,576 --> 00:51:49,526
So she wants to take this to the end?

602
00:52:16,385 --> 00:52:19,065
Why did you need to 
waste your time asking that?

603
00:52:19,206 --> 00:52:22,027
Go dig into that woman's past.

604
00:52:22,283 --> 00:52:23,250
What?!

605
00:52:23,476 --> 00:52:26,430
Find out what's going on
between her and your father.

606
00:52:26,647 --> 00:52:28,415
Ehh... Mom, you really...

607
00:52:28,527 --> 00:52:30,371
Always having me 
do all the dirty work.

608
00:52:38,068 --> 00:52:44,020
So you joined forces with her
to make Jeongyeon your heir?

609
00:52:45,732 --> 00:52:47,649
You can't fool me.

610
00:52:48,041 --> 00:52:49,972
This is not just business.

611
00:52:50,599 --> 00:52:51,824
Right?

612
00:53:22,591 --> 00:53:27,335
<i>- Wau Apartment Collapses -
27 Dead, 3-4 in Dire Condition</i>

613
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:35,311

614
00:53:42,241 --> 00:53:43,416
Yes?

615
00:53:43,764 --> 00:53:48,250
<i>I got you a meeting with
Congressman Oh, tomorrow at 2 pm.</i>

616
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:49,755
Thanks, Hyung.

Yes...

620
00:54:19,614 --> 00:54:20,818
What's this?

621
00:54:21,345 --> 00:54:24,442
So you were the one
Congressman Min Honggi sent?

622
00:54:24,545 --> 00:54:27,461
Just listen to me for a moment.

623
00:54:27,724 --> 00:54:30,085
I can imagine what you'll
say already, what's the point?

624
00:54:30,192 --> 00:54:31,063
Just go.

625
00:54:31,157 --> 00:54:34,726
- Congressman.
- Ohh Ohh... I said leave!

626
00:54:39,112 --> 00:54:40,101
Yes?

627
00:54:40,214 --> 00:54:41,803
<i>It's me, Congressman.</i>

628
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,072
Listen, Congressman Min.

629
00:54:44,469 --> 00:54:46,990
Who is this man, to send him here?

630
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:51,316
Have I ever done anything
to compromise you, Sir?

631

So trust me on this
and have a talk with him.

632
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:56,512
Yes...

633
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:59,709
Yes, I'll soon repay the courtesy.

634
00:55:00,123 --> 00:55:01,374
Yes.

635
00:55:05,502 --> 00:55:06,330
Thank you, Seonbaenim.

If it weren't for you,
think I'd be sitting there?

638
00:55:12,349 --> 00:55:15,719
On the contrary, 
I feel bad I couldn't help you more.

639
00:55:28,347 --> 00:55:33,297
I'm afraid I haven't needed
political funding for quite some time.

640
00:55:33,645 --> 00:55:34,943
It's not that.

641
00:55:35,103 --> 00:55:38,631
Then, what is it, pocket money?

642
00:55:40,201 --> 00:55:43,201
Min Honggi will have to hear from me.

643
00:55:49,974 --> 00:55:52,814
What's this...
Aren't they just articles?

644
00:55:53,134 --> 00:55:58,766
These are all about construction-related
accidents from the Seventies.

645
00:56:01,559 --> 00:56:05,970
<i>- Wau Apartment Collapses -</i>

646
00:56:11,533 --> 00:56:18,061
All those accidents, including that 
collapse, started from faulty constructions.

647
00:56:18,179 --> 00:56:19,373
So?

648
00:56:19,693 --> 00:56:22,100
What do you intend to accomplish 
by showing these to me?

649
00:56:22,204 --> 00:56:27,522
I'm sure you're well aware of the
reasons behind those faulty constructions.

650
00:56:28,416 --> 00:56:31,218
On one hand, you pressure the 
construction companies and pocket some,

651
00:56:31,472 --> 00:56:35,328
while on the other hand you help them gain
construction concessions through bribes.

652
00:56:36,817 --> 00:56:39,972
What are you trying to imply?

653
00:56:40,761 --> 00:56:46,226
That the responsibility
for this all lies with you.

654
00:56:46,771 --> 00:56:47,718
What?

655
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:51,075
Because you're the one
who pocketed all that money.

656
00:56:51,169 --> 00:56:53,709
- Say what, you...
- My mother!

657
00:56:55,050 --> 00:56:58,397
Lost her life because
of a briquette gas leak.

658
00:57:01,594 --> 00:57:06,654
There is only one reason why
I want to build apartments.

659
00:57:08,185 --> 00:57:09,538
So that people...

660
00:57:10,224 --> 00:57:14,447
will never have to die 
because of a gas leak,

661
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:23,209
and will be able to share their happy memories
in reliable and inexpensive apartments.

662
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:33,280
If you used any of that political funding,
you could have easily developed new technologies.

663
00:57:33,901 --> 00:57:38,452
If you feel even just a
shred of guilt for what you did,

664
00:57:38,688 --> 00:57:43,282
help me secure 
that construction permit.

665
00:57:46,592 --> 00:57:48,116
Leave.

666
00:57:49,912 --> 00:57:55,427
I might have a conscience,
but my hands are clean.

667
00:57:55,542 --> 00:57:58,538
- Congressman...
- Get out of my sight!

668
00:59:07,823 --> 00:59:11,905
<i>- Gaepo Development Plan -</i>

669
00:59:54,456 --> 00:59:56,446
<i>Gangmo!</i>

670
00:59:57,471 --> 00:59:58,806
How... How did it go?

671
00:59:58,882 --> 01:00:02,361
So did you get his consent?

672
01:00:06,891 --> 01:00:08,963
Here he goes again with his shows...

673
01:00:09,086 --> 01:00:13,694
Don't do that and just tell us.
He gave you that permit, right?

674
01:00:16,637 --> 01:00:20,424
I think we'll just
have to sell that land.

675
01:00:24,138 --> 01:00:26,273
I apologize to you all.

676
01:00:30,969 --> 01:00:32,083
Right!

677
01:00:32,197 --> 01:00:36,315
Why, who said we must build 
apartments there at all cost?

678
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:40,435
We can just sell that land and 
build somewhere else with that money.

679
01:00:40,604 --> 01:00:41,883
Isn't that right, Sotae?

680
01:00:41,930 --> 01:00:43,200
Of course!

681
01:00:43,275 --> 01:00:47,197
Don't you worry, we can make
plenty of money even without that.

682
01:00:53,854 --> 01:00:56,577
Yes, Hangang Construction.

683
01:00:57,315 --> 01:00:59,083
Yes, how can I help you?

684
01:01:00,507 --> 01:01:02,020
All right.

685
01:01:02,199 --> 01:01:03,666
Yes.

686
01:01:05,592 --> 01:01:07,070
Who called?

687
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:11,513
Was it the City Council?
They said they're giving us something.

688
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:14,716
Giving us? What?

689
01:01:14,857 --> 01:01:16,371
What did he say?!

690
01:01:16,691 --> 01:01:18,252
Ahh, right.
A construction permit.

691
01:01:18,365 --> 01:01:21,102
They said they're giving us that.

692
01:01:21,619 --> 01:01:24,997
Are you sure it was
a construction permit?

693
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:25,785
Oppa...

694
01:01:25,879 --> 01:01:27,732
Forgot how smart I am?

695
01:01:27,845 --> 01:01:30,262
Think I wouldn't know what that means?

696
01:01:36,606 --> 01:01:39,446
Did they really tell you 
they were giving us that permit?

697
01:01:39,596 --> 01:01:41,110
Are you all deaf?

698
01:01:41,233 --> 01:01:43,033
I said yes.

699
01:01:43,296 --> 01:01:44,284
That's it!

700
01:01:44,406 --> 01:01:45,619
- We did it!
- Right!

701
01:01:45,704 --> 01:01:49,226
I knew it... There was 
no way Gangmo wouldn't make it!

702
01:01:50,457 --> 01:01:53,297
- Am I dreaming?
- Course not.

703
01:01:53,457 --> 01:01:56,316
- I can't believe it!
- That hurts, you twat.

704
01:01:56,391 --> 01:01:58,451
You're our good luck charm, Gyeongja!

705
01:01:58,507 --> 01:02:02,269
What's wrong with you?
You're messing up my manicure!

706
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:06,633
Thank you.

707
01:02:07,546 --> 01:02:11,054
I've heard you're giving us 
a construction permit.

708
01:02:12,306 --> 01:02:16,897
Congressman Oh said
he'd take full responsibility.

709
01:02:17,621 --> 01:02:18,952
Thank you.

710
01:02:19,145 --> 01:02:21,092
Thank you very much, Commissioner.

711
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:25,460
But... 
There is still a little problem.

712
01:02:25,690 --> 01:02:27,106
A problem?

713
01:02:27,304 --> 01:02:30,388
I did file a request for that permit,

714
01:02:30,669 --> 01:02:34,569
but the final decision rests with 
the Ministry of Construction.

715
01:02:35,246 --> 01:02:39,046
But if City Council asks for it,
wouldn't it just be a formality?

716
01:02:39,168 --> 01:02:41,604
In most cases, that's what happens,

717
01:02:42,309 --> 01:02:44,405
but there's a surprising
factor at play here.

718
01:02:45,543 --> 01:02:47,734
What would this factor be?

719
01:02:48,261 --> 01:02:54,050
These days, the minister puts a lot 
of faith in his consultation panel.

720
01:02:54,821 --> 01:02:56,561
And the man leading that panel...

721
01:02:57,050 --> 01:02:58,978
is Jo Pilyeon.

722
01:03:02,843 --> 01:03:05,321
If Jo Pilyeon shows opposition,

723
01:03:05,801 --> 01:03:11,914
there's a very strong possibility the
minister might refuse to grant you that permit.

724
01:03:14,647 --> 01:03:19,570
Where must I go to meet Jo Pilyeon?

725
01:03:19,702 --> 01:03:21,714
Hey... Gangmo!

726
01:03:21,818 --> 01:03:25,688
What would be the use of going there?

727
01:03:25,782 --> 01:03:29,177
Unless he's gone crazy, Jo Pilyeon 
would never give us that permit!

728
01:03:29,290 --> 01:03:31,444
Already forgot what 
it took to get this far?

729
01:03:31,663 --> 01:03:34,500
We'll have to face
whatever's in our way!

730
01:03:48,184 --> 01:03:49,788
Don't go in.

731
01:03:51,586 --> 01:03:53,514
I said don't.

732
01:04:19,544 --> 01:04:22,965
Then, I'll get going.

733
01:04:23,580 --> 01:04:26,522
I'm always here for you, Jeongyeon.

734
01:04:34,563 --> 01:04:36,971
You were one step 
too late, Lee Gangmo.
