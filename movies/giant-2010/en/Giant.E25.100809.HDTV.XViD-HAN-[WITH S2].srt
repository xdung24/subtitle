{\a6}- Episode 25 -

6
00:00:11,985 --> 00:00:13,784
Have a seat.

7
00:00:21,727 --> 00:00:26,941
So, what brings you here?

8
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:28,937
Let's start with the introductions.

9
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,016
My name is James Lee.

10
00:00:32,322 --> 00:00:35,593
James... Lee?!

11
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:44,264
A look at the eyes of people coming here, 
and you'll usually witness two feelings.

12
00:00:44,467 --> 00:00:48,114
One of frantic, pressing concern,
or just plain despair.

13
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:52,343
But you seem to be a
little different, young fella?

14
00:00:52,414 --> 00:00:55,311
I'm well aware of 
your business method.

15
00:00:55,394 --> 00:00:57,437
Is that so?

16
00:00:59,444 --> 00:01:01,915
So what do people say about me?

17
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:04,421
To never let my guard down.

18
00:01:04,813 --> 00:01:07,521
Or, at the first sign of weakness,
you'd either squeeze money out of me,

19
00:01:07,616 --> 00:01:11,625
completely run me dry, 
or even bring forth my collapse.

20
00:01:13,488 --> 00:01:16,577
- That's insulting.
- Nah.

21
00:01:16,755 --> 00:01:18,406
Money means survival,

22
00:01:18,501 --> 00:01:20,817
and if he came here to stake
his entire life on this deal,

23
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:23,412
that much insight is a given.

24
00:01:23,602 --> 00:01:25,170
Let's begin by seeing your collateral.

25
00:01:25,289 --> 00:01:28,579
I hear that, based on the collateral,
your interest rates might vary.

26
00:01:28,793 --> 00:01:32,308
Shall we take a look 
at the contract, then?

27
00:01:32,403 --> 00:01:34,487
Show it to him.

28
00:01:46,903 --> 00:01:50,285
May I write down the interest rate 
that would best suit me?

29
00:01:50,344 --> 00:01:51,163
Look...

30
00:01:51,247 --> 00:01:53,135
What do you take him for?

31
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,902
Write it down.

32
00:01:55,558 --> 00:01:56,924
But, Sir...

33
00:02:15,163 --> 00:02:18,939
So you won't give me 
a penny for the trouble?

34
00:02:21,205 --> 00:02:23,703
I guess it's time 
to see the collateral, then.

35
00:02:24,545 --> 00:02:26,873
<i>{\a6}- High Efficiency Cement Business Plan -</i>

36
00:02:25,401 --> 00:02:27,554
<i>Here is my business plan.</i>

37
00:02:29,805 --> 00:02:34,396
I'm in the money-lending
business, I'm no investor!

38
00:02:34,503 --> 00:02:38,696
All this time, you've been making 
money while hiding in the shadows.

39
00:02:39,112 --> 00:02:42,270
Whereas I want to earn my living 
in the most transparent way.

40
00:02:42,341 --> 00:02:45,355
Shady or transparent,
money has always the same color.

41
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:47,369
The moment it's brought into play,

42
00:02:47,481 --> 00:02:52,658
it brings forth great struggle and 
gives you immense power no matter what.

43
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:56,806
I appreciate your confidence,
but your collateral is not to my liking.

44
00:02:56,914 --> 00:02:59,070
You may leave.

45
00:03:05,556 --> 00:03:08,164
Would this satisfy you, then?

46
00:03:08,273 --> 00:03:09,691
And what is this?

47
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:14,011
A land deed for my mudflats in Gaepo.

48
00:03:31,518 --> 00:03:34,838
- Sir, this land...
- I'm sure you know...

49
00:03:34,983 --> 00:03:38,634
what will soon become of that land.

50
00:03:38,847 --> 00:03:40,700
How much are you looking for?

51
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:42,363
Sir.

52
00:03:42,924 --> 00:03:45,807
Please read my business plan.

53
00:03:46,432 --> 00:03:50,939
What I really wish for right now
is not a huge sum of money,

54
00:03:51,035 --> 00:03:54,682
but a moment of your time,
to be devoted to reading that plan.

55
00:04:20,098 --> 00:04:21,826
How did it go?

56
00:04:21,923 --> 00:04:23,915
You didn't leave the
land deed with him, did you?

57
00:04:24,021 --> 00:04:27,046
We agreed to meet again 
after I develop our new technology.

58
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:31,762
So you're telling me he agreed to
lend you money without any collateral?

59
00:04:32,142 --> 00:04:33,448
If things go according to plan,

60
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,021
he might become our Hangang
Construction's very first investor.

61
00:04:39,031 --> 00:04:41,368
I can't believe it.

62
00:04:41,523 --> 00:04:47,450
There's a good reason why people
in his trade call him "vampire"...

63
00:04:51,227 --> 00:04:55,909
Are you really planning to
lend him money without a collateral?

64
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,833
I don't know.

65
00:04:58,558 --> 00:05:00,838
I haven't made up my mind, yet.

66
00:05:01,211 --> 00:05:07,090
I've never seen 
you confused before, Sir.

67
00:05:07,246 --> 00:05:10,898
Was it James... Lee?

68
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:14,236
What most confuses me...

69
00:05:14,307 --> 00:05:19,890
is the realization that there is
someone who could confuse me.

70
00:05:36,867 --> 00:05:41,269
So now you're even ignoring me,
just because you can't talk?

71
00:05:46,119 --> 00:05:49,427
I don't need your shares any longer.

72
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:55,140
I secured more than enough
holdings to win a majority vote.

73
00:05:56,746 --> 00:06:00,373
So you should have listened
to me while you still could.

74
00:06:00,622 --> 00:06:04,186
Why risk it all by doggedly
trying to contend with me?

75
00:06:04,792 --> 00:06:06,906
<i>When Jeongshik 
inherits the company,</i>

76
00:06:07,013 --> 00:06:10,041
we could just take away all
your shares for incompetence,

77
00:06:10,196 --> 00:06:13,808
and trap you inside a hospital
room for the rest of your days.

78
00:06:18,614 --> 00:06:24,161
But if you give up your shares now,

79
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:29,332
I'll pay you generously for the trouble, 
and allow you to live overseas.

80
00:06:30,614 --> 00:06:36,317
It is my very last act of generosity,
merely for my husband's sake.

81
00:06:38,895 --> 00:06:41,893
<i>You have until the 
shareholders' meeting to decide.</i>

82
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,796
If you let that day pass, 
then no excuse is ever going to work.

83
00:07:13,421 --> 00:07:18,540
What do we owe your
kind invitation to, Miss Yoo?

84
00:07:18,712 --> 00:07:21,693
I wanted to discuss the Manbo
Construction succession matter,

85
00:07:21,803 --> 00:07:23,632
as fellow shareholders.

86
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:28,323
Didn't we all agree to push for
Hwang Jeongshik as the heir?

87
00:07:28,432 --> 00:07:30,577
I see this issue in a different way.

88
00:07:30,663 --> 00:07:33,640
Considering performance on the field,

89
00:07:34,222 --> 00:07:38,224
I believe Hwang Jeongyeon
would be much more fit for the job.

90
00:07:38,307 --> 00:07:42,441
Don't even joke about such nonsense!

91
00:07:43,058 --> 00:07:48,605
Forget anything else, but how can you
let a woman run a construction business?

92
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:53,519
Are you against it merely
because she's a woman?

93
00:07:54,790 --> 00:08:01,769
Is there anyone here willing to invest
in a construction company run by a woman?

94
00:08:05,641 --> 00:08:07,826
Have you seen, Miss Yoo?

95
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:11,211
Not a single one of them.

96
00:08:11,674 --> 00:08:17,253
And it's not the first time I see
a woman ruin a company that way.

97
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,831
But, Miss Yoo... Don't you know that
Hwang Jeongyeon is suffering from aphasia?

98
00:08:22,985 --> 00:08:27,041
- That...
- There is no need to argue this!

99
00:08:27,159 --> 00:08:32,198
How can you let a woman
with poor health run a business?

100
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,967
Let's just stop talking
about this, Miss Yoo.

101
00:08:35,077 --> 00:08:39,491
It's obvious how it'll end,
no matter how you put it.

102
00:08:47,032 --> 00:08:48,727
I'm late, right?

103
00:08:48,834 --> 00:08:51,248
Where are all the shareholders?

104
00:08:51,581 --> 00:08:54,170
It would be wise 
not to meet them now.

105
00:08:54,289 --> 00:08:54,978
What?

106
00:08:55,097 --> 00:08:57,392
Let's have a word.

107
00:09:02,961 --> 00:09:06,319
Are you suggesting that there's
no way to convince them?

108
00:09:08,106 --> 00:09:10,486
Whatever the case, 
I'll just face them.

109
00:09:10,582 --> 00:09:11,825
Giving up now would be...

110
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,960
They're opposing your
candidacy for two reasons.

111
00:09:15,542 --> 00:09:18,238
The fact you're a woman,
and because you suffer from aphasia.

112
00:09:18,345 --> 00:09:21,410
Suffering from aphasia
is a non-issue, already.

113
00:09:21,481 --> 00:09:25,608
But the crux of the matter is
that they refuse to acknowledge you,

114
00:09:25,715 --> 00:09:28,471
because you're a woman.

115
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:33,127
If you can manage to 
overcome those weaknesses,

116
00:09:33,234 --> 00:09:35,217
then you still have a chance.

117
00:09:35,301 --> 00:09:40,302
So you want me to turn a crisis
into an opportunity?

118
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:46,855
Ma'am, a guest is waiting for you.

119
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,497
Who is it?

120
00:09:48,616 --> 00:09:52,122
The wife of Manbo 
Construction's chairman.

121
00:09:57,182 --> 00:09:59,486
Keep in mind what I told you.

122
00:09:59,814 --> 00:10:06,858
Successfully turning a crisis into an 
opportunity only depends on your timing.

123
00:10:24,877 --> 00:10:27,009
Always a beauty, Miss Yoo.

124
00:10:27,128 --> 00:10:30,386
Ahh... Let me introduce my mother.

125
00:10:31,487 --> 00:10:33,743
I've heard a lot about you.

126
00:10:34,302 --> 00:10:36,131
It's a pleasure to meet you.

127
00:10:37,746 --> 00:10:39,693
What brings you here?

128
00:10:43,782 --> 00:10:47,713
You've invested quite
the sum in our company...

129
00:10:47,806 --> 00:10:51,953
I see even selling drinks for
a living can be profitable?!

130
00:10:53,673 --> 00:10:56,870
Oh my... 
I meant it as a compliment.

131
00:10:56,962 --> 00:10:59,747
I hope there was 
no misunderstanding?!

132
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,467
Why don't you get to the point?

133
00:11:02,609 --> 00:11:05,149
I have very important 
guests to deal with.

134
00:11:05,244 --> 00:11:10,734
I'd like you to support Jeongshik
at the next shareholders' meeting.

135
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,244
Of course it's already 
a foregone conclusion,

136
00:11:15,315 --> 00:11:20,244
but I still hope you
could give us your help.

137
00:11:20,988 --> 00:11:23,415
You're aware of 
Hwang Jeongyeon's situation, right?

138
00:11:23,545 --> 00:11:25,934
About her catching aphasia, and all.

139
00:11:26,491 --> 00:11:29,639
I thought Jeongyeon 
was your daughter as well,

140
00:11:29,737 --> 00:11:31,374
what's the reason you're doing this?

141
00:11:31,492 --> 00:11:35,650
It's a family matter, so there's no
doubt I'll be treading murky waters,

142
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:39,771
but since you're a major shareholder, 
I'll be honest with you.

143
00:11:41,113 --> 00:11:43,548
Jeongyeon's birth mother...

144
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:46,164
was just a bar girl.

145
00:11:49,047 --> 00:11:50,425
Think about it.

146
00:11:50,532 --> 00:11:53,359
If the world learns that the
daughter of a lowly bar girl...

147
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:56,898
is running Manbo Construction,
how will people react?

148
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:58,807
<i>Let alone ruining the company's image,</i>

149
00:11:58,902 --> 00:12:02,454
wouldn't it also impact
our shares on the stock exchange?

150
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:07,431
I suppose.

151
00:12:07,609 --> 00:12:14,117
Then, I'll consider that
as your stamp of approval.

152
00:12:15,483 --> 00:12:17,467
Seems like we're done talking,

153
00:12:17,752 --> 00:12:20,721
so if you'll excuse me, 
I'll have to leave.

154
00:12:23,565 --> 00:12:25,720
Go ahead.

155
00:12:25,809 --> 00:12:29,169
Whenever we get the chance,
let's have a drink together.

156
00:12:29,651 --> 00:12:33,338
I'll be happy to treat you, then.

157
00:12:33,984 --> 00:12:40,160
Meeting outside the confines of my business 
relationships is against my principles.

158
00:12:49,412 --> 00:12:52,265
How can a wench running
a club be so haughty?

159
00:12:52,336 --> 00:12:53,429
Mom!

160
00:12:53,547 --> 00:12:54,890
You've seen it yourself!

161
00:12:54,996 --> 00:12:57,218
Her treating me like a pushover.

162
00:12:57,313 --> 00:12:59,546
<i>Think all money is the same?</i>

163
00:12:59,617 --> 00:13:02,791
<i>She'll hear you, stop it!</i>

164
00:13:09,751 --> 00:13:13,304
Did anything happen inside?

165
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:16,499
Agasshi.

166
00:13:16,891 --> 00:13:18,432
Shideok.

167
00:13:19,013 --> 00:13:22,802
You've been collecting
company data, right?

168
00:13:23,099 --> 00:13:24,940
Bring it all to the hospital.

169
00:13:25,124 --> 00:13:25,772
What?

170
00:13:25,867 --> 00:13:28,670
Both reports of all our
current construction projects,

171
00:13:28,896 --> 00:13:33,215
along with our accounting
records, all of them.

172
00:13:35,082 --> 00:13:36,659
Yes.

173
00:13:44,437 --> 00:13:50,255
It feels so good 
to have you both by my side.

174
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:53,963
You remember?

175
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,697
When we lived in Busan,

176
00:13:55,792 --> 00:14:00,381
the five of us all 
slept in the same room.

177
00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:05,192
When Dad came back
after a night out drinking,

178
00:14:05,239 --> 00:14:07,558
he'd snore so loudly.

179
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:12,452
I miss that sound so much.

180
00:14:12,543 --> 00:14:14,389
Don't you?

181
00:14:15,575 --> 00:14:17,457
Don't worry about that.

182
00:14:17,702 --> 00:14:20,873
Gangmo and I will snore 
all night for you instead.

183
00:14:22,454 --> 00:14:25,272
Little Oppa used to even 
grind his teeth.

184
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:27,837
Are you still doing that?

185
00:14:27,966 --> 00:14:29,425
Miju.

186
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:33,789
For the time being,

187
00:14:34,084 --> 00:14:36,634
I think we'll have to live apart.

188
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,600
What's that supposed to mean?

189
00:14:39,714 --> 00:14:42,355
We just got back together.

190
00:14:42,485 --> 00:14:44,179
I need to go down to the provinces.

191
00:14:44,273 --> 00:14:45,791
And I've got work to do there.

192
00:14:45,873 --> 00:14:48,540
No way! Don't go.

193
00:14:49,061 --> 00:14:50,518
Miju.

194
00:14:50,777 --> 00:14:56,236
Until his sentence is over,
Gangmo must keep hiding.

195
00:14:56,466 --> 00:14:58,577
Try to be understanding.

196
00:14:58,789 --> 00:15:00,353
Right, Miju.

197
00:15:00,611 --> 00:15:02,773
Once my sentence is over,

198
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:06,879
then we'll never 
have to separate again.

199
00:15:08,529 --> 00:15:14,761
You must never tell anyone 
you have brothers, yet.

200
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:16,723
Is that clear, Miju?

201
00:15:20,229 --> 00:15:24,299
Instead, call often.

202
00:15:24,497 --> 00:15:25,829
Sure.

203
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:29,323
Every now and then,
I'll even come pay you a visit.

204
00:15:38,089 --> 00:15:40,171
Ahh... This is so hard.

205
00:15:40,277 --> 00:15:41,929
Push, will you?

206
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,011
And what else am I doing now?

207
00:15:44,058 --> 00:15:46,400
- As if you weren't an old fart...
- What? Old fart?!

208
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,058
Did you just call me an old fart?

209
00:15:48,105 --> 00:15:50,508
I sure did. Going to Samcheong at that age, 
what else should I call you,

210
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:54,647
- a fresh young breeze?
- Still better than damaged goods, you fool.

211
00:15:54,741 --> 00:15:58,664
Give me a break,
how can that be worse?

212
00:15:58,746 --> 00:16:02,299
- Stop prattling and start pushing!
- That's what I'm doing!

213
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:06,299
- Aigoo... Let's pull a little harder!
- But why the hell is this so heavy?

214
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:10,022
Ohh... It's so hard!
Aigoo! So hard.

215
00:16:10,256 --> 00:16:14,754
- Are you faking it?
- I said I'm pushing!

216
00:16:14,825 --> 00:16:16,390
Gangmo.

217
00:16:16,484 --> 00:16:19,119
Gangmo, when did you get here?

218
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:23,988
<i>You don't look like you pushed at all!</i>

219
00:16:24,047 --> 00:16:27,201

220
00:16:42,071 --> 00:16:43,671

221
00:16:43,977 --> 00:16:45,732
Hold it.

222
00:16:45,895 --> 00:16:48,038
This way?

223
00:17:03,872 --> 00:17:05,082

If we manage not to use 
sand and gravel,

229
00:17:54,795 --> 00:17:57,747
by how much would 
construction costs be reduced?

230
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:00,958
I'd say a good 
30-40 percent, at least?

231
00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:04,234
Wow... That's huge.

232
00:18:04,342 --> 00:18:05,726
But if there was such a way,

233
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,873
why would everyone else 
waste time with gravel?

234
00:18:08,976 --> 00:18:12,474
If we're going to compete with
big players like Manbo Construction,

235

You're sure I'm not going to fall, right?

So what is it?

317
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,667
How is Lee Seongmo doing, 
these days?

318
00:24:34,762 --> 00:24:38,341
He's very popular in the agency for 
being meticulous in all his dealings.

319
00:24:38,447 --> 00:24:41,859
Ever felt there could be
some kind of collusion going on...

320
00:24:41,969 --> 00:24:44,807
between him and Min Honggi?

321
00:24:45,367 --> 00:24:47,094
What are you implying with that?

322
00:24:47,212 --> 00:24:53,435
I'm just wondering whether he might
be helping Min behind the scenes.

323
00:24:53,545 --> 00:24:56,929
Never received any 
such report, I'm afraid.

324
00:24:57,817 --> 00:24:59,156
Right...

325
00:25:00,391 --> 00:25:03,262
While Min Honggi was
having dinner with the director,

326
00:25:03,625 --> 00:25:07,371
I did hear him asking the director
to take good care of Lee Seongmo.

327
00:25:09,578 --> 00:25:10,896
Is that true?

328
00:25:11,002 --> 00:25:14,343
What did he call him...
a "trusted colleague" or something?!

329
00:25:14,507 --> 00:25:18,543
Back in his KCIA days,
wasn't he working under Min?

330
00:25:20,484 --> 00:25:23,013
If he goes as far as saying that 
during unofficial meetings,

331
00:25:23,107 --> 00:25:25,707
wouldn't the two be very close?

332
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:30,668
I have a previous engagement, 
so I'll have to go.

333
00:25:32,833 --> 00:25:35,056
Let me do it, Sir.

334
00:25:42,763 --> 00:25:46,394
I can't even imagine the possibility.

335
00:25:46,594 --> 00:25:49,644
Seongmo betraying you?!

336
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:51,618
There must be a mistake.

337
00:25:51,712 --> 00:25:53,633
There is no way something
like that would happen!

338
00:25:53,716 --> 00:25:58,598
The impossible becoming reality
is what people are all about.

339
00:25:58,716 --> 00:26:03,480
Are you suspecting Seongmo?

340
00:26:10,021 --> 00:26:14,185
These days, Jo Pilyeon is visiting
clearance areas under his jurisdiction.

341
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:15,680
Clearance areas?! Why?

342
00:26:15,762 --> 00:26:20,092
He's just paying close attention,
without any particular move.

343
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:23,457
I'm sure he's 
scheming something there.

344
00:26:23,771 --> 00:26:26,100
- Keep watching him.
- Yes.

345
00:26:27,046 --> 00:26:28,410
Right.

346
00:26:28,968 --> 00:26:32,030
I've heard this from
a Support Department agent,

347
00:26:32,112 --> 00:26:35,936
but it seems like the chief there
asked about you and Min Honggi?!

348
00:26:36,912 --> 00:26:38,299
Chief Oh?

349
00:26:38,402 --> 00:26:39,701
Yes.

350
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:48,624
<i>Look, Director Park.</i>

351
00:26:48,914 --> 00:26:56,048
Do you believe only completing 20 percent 
of the highway construction makes sense?

352
00:26:56,166 --> 00:27:00,038
We've been facing quite
a few problems as of late.

353
00:27:00,337 --> 00:27:04,907
Especially in regards to tightening
the soil before pouring cement.

354
00:27:05,109 --> 00:27:07,305
I don't need your excuses!

355
00:27:09,156 --> 00:27:10,944
Chief Jo.

356
00:27:11,163 --> 00:27:15,153
Take over the highway
construction project.

357
00:27:15,233 --> 00:27:16,057
Chairman.

358
00:27:16,155 --> 00:27:21,003
Chief Jo will soon be promoted
to Director of Planning.

359
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:26,961
I'll do this with the future success 
of this highway construction in mind,

360
00:27:27,431 --> 00:27:30,024
so don't disappoint me.

361
00:27:30,843 --> 00:27:32,914
Certainly, Chairman.

362
00:27:45,887 --> 00:27:48,754
You're really impressive, Chief.

363
00:27:48,907 --> 00:27:52,408
By showing interest in
the highway project as of late,

364
00:27:52,506 --> 00:27:55,470
were you already 
expecting this would happen?

365
00:28:08,857 --> 00:28:10,339
Yes.

366
00:28:11,727 --> 00:28:13,539
How did it go?

367
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,602
A job there in accounting?!

368
00:28:18,602 --> 00:28:20,979
Sure... Thanks.

369
00:28:23,892 --> 00:28:26,261
What, something 
going on between us?!

370
00:28:26,637 --> 00:28:29,528
I'm just helping her out
of compassion, that's all.

371
00:28:30,705 --> 00:28:32,834
All right, fine.

372
00:28:39,316 --> 00:28:41,457
<i>Thank you, Chief.</i>

373
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:44,307
For rescuing me.

374
00:28:45,903 --> 00:28:48,693
If it weren't for you, I'd...

375
00:28:50,024 --> 00:28:52,966
Chief...

376
00:28:54,436 --> 00:28:56,235
Thank God.

377
00:28:57,026 --> 00:28:59,235
Nothing happened.

378
00:29:08,895 --> 00:29:11,261
Why did I say that?

379
00:29:28,862 --> 00:29:32,077
What brings you here?

380
00:29:32,568 --> 00:29:34,815
Is Lee Miju here?

381
00:29:36,121 --> 00:29:38,509
You came to see Miju?

382
00:29:38,928 --> 00:29:40,497
Where is she now?

383
00:29:40,638 --> 00:29:43,732
You'll find her on the rooftop.

384
00:29:53,167 --> 00:29:56,587
How. Are. You?

385
00:30:09,987 --> 00:30:12,188
It's so hot...

386
00:30:19,232 --> 00:30:24,021
I'm Lee Miju, I just came back
from my tour of Southeast Asia.

387
00:30:24,185 --> 00:30:26,821
<i>Everyone, I love you!</i>

388
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:31,223
<i>{\a6}*Hyeeun megahit. "(Eodeureo) Gamsugwang"
is Jeju dialect for "where are you going?"</i>

389
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:31,223
I'll now sing you 
my hit song, "Where*."

390
00:30:34,846 --> 00:30:42,435
Windy Jeju is full of rocks,

00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:49,471
But also of kindhearted
and gentle young ladies.

392
00:30:49,936 --> 00:30:51,906
Where...

393
00:30:52,012 --> 00:30:57,468
Where are you going, 
and how about me,

394
00:30:57,569 --> 00:31:01,284
<i>You pitiful little thing.</i>

395
00:31:01,413 --> 00:31:05,814
I will let you go this once,
so hurry up and co...

396
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,629
Who is there?

397
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,518
I asked who's there.

398
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:24,264
Chief!

399
00:31:29,386 --> 00:31:34,158
Hey... Can someone who dreams of 
becoming a singer actually sing so bad?

400
00:31:35,053 --> 00:31:37,680
I'm bad at it so I keep practicing.

401
00:31:38,221 --> 00:31:40,880
But, what are you doing here?

402
00:31:41,021 --> 00:31:42,409
You're back on the employed list.

403
00:31:42,539 --> 00:31:43,327
What?

404
00:31:43,445 --> 00:31:45,282
I found you a job.

405
00:31:45,998 --> 00:31:49,276
You got me a job, personally?

406
00:31:49,437 --> 00:31:52,618
Don't ever work at places
like that bus company again.

407
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,771
Thank you, Chief.

408
00:31:54,877 --> 00:31:57,842
I was looking for a job myself.

409
00:31:57,983 --> 00:32:01,471
You know how to 
write a resume, right?

410
00:32:01,634 --> 00:32:03,434
Resume?!

411
00:32:14,985 --> 00:32:16,514
Chief...

412
00:32:19,244 --> 00:32:20,753
What?

413
00:32:21,374 --> 00:32:24,446
Should I really list my
academic background as well?

414
00:32:24,554 --> 00:32:26,573
Write down every little thing.

415

418
00:32:50,403 --> 00:32:52,336
<i>Is that clear, Miju?</i>

419
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:59,095
<i>- Orphan -</i>

420
00:33:02,024 --> 00:33:05,554
<i>- Introduction -</i>

421
00:33:40,814 --> 00:33:42,696
It's done.

422
00:33:43,196 --> 00:33:45,941
But where should I present this?

423
00:33:46,237 --> 00:33:47,235
Give it here.

424
00:33:47,346 --> 00:33:48,269
What?

425
00:33:48,376 --> 00:33:50,279
No way.

426
00:33:50,684 --> 00:33:52,261
I said give it here.

427
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:55,543
I'll just deal with it myself.

428

430
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:22,271
Give it here... I'll do it!

431
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:25,615
Do you know what kind 
of company this is?

432
00:34:25,892 --> 00:34:29,439
Think you could just get in
with such lousy credentials?

433
00:34:32,121 --> 00:34:35,662
Just do as I say, 
don't argue with me.

434
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:38,286
Give me a call tomorrow.

435
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:39,899
What?

436
00:34:40,029 --> 00:34:42,370
Don't make me waste time looking
for you for something so trivial.

437
00:34:42,476 --> 00:34:43,958
Here.

438
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:48,676
Chief.

439
00:34:54,059 --> 00:34:55,931
Thank you.

440
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:03,341
I've never been treated
with such kindness before.

441
00:35:03,506 --> 00:35:06,646
I'm really thankful for all 
you're doing for me, Chief.

442
00:35:27,869 --> 00:35:30,045
Don't get any strange idea.

443
00:35:30,916 --> 00:35:35,022
I just felt sad you lost your job 
because of me, so that's why.

444
00:35:50,463 --> 00:35:53,040
Almost fell for it again.

445
00:35:58,714 --> 00:36:01,831
<i>So why are you feeling like that?</i>

446
00:36:04,383 --> 00:36:05,761
What's the matter?

447
00:36:05,937 --> 00:36:08,255
Don't get me started.

448
00:36:08,473 --> 00:36:14,076
This motherless old cunt...
I'll be damned...

449
00:36:14,198 --> 00:36:17,117
He just got up in arms
saying nothing will work.

450
00:36:17,234 --> 00:36:19,952
He just suddenly turned everything 
upside down, cursing a storm,

451
00:36:20,045 --> 00:36:21,811
not to mention getting piss drunk.

452
00:36:21,917 --> 00:36:23,234
The end.

453
00:36:25,161 --> 00:36:28,832
But, the way I see it,

454
00:36:28,985 --> 00:36:31,938
I don't think calcium
chloride will ever work.

455
00:36:32,161 --> 00:36:35,514
If it was such a simple matter,
everyone would be going for it already.

456
00:36:36,968 --> 00:36:41,062
So let's just give up road construction,
get ourselves some laborers and...

457
00:36:41,144 --> 00:36:46,497
Get rid of those damaged goods...

458
00:36:46,697 --> 00:36:49,544
Get rid of what? You, shut up!

459
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:06,927
Ahh... Did he shove 
the bottle up his ass?

460
00:37:07,056 --> 00:37:08,865
Swearing every ch...

461
00:37:13,562 --> 00:37:18,477
How can a construction
company's stairs look like this?

462
00:37:27,512 --> 00:37:30,095
This seems tight enough.

463
00:37:30,299 --> 00:37:32,366
Not bad?!

464
00:37:50,763 --> 00:37:53,199
<i>Gangmo, what's wrong?</i>

465
00:37:58,695 --> 00:38:00,411
Wake up! Quick!

466
00:38:00,505 --> 00:38:01,855
Get up.

467
00:38:01,961 --> 00:38:04,152
Aigoo, what's the matter...

468
00:38:04,369 --> 00:38:07,855
Here... What did they use 
to make this brick?

469
00:38:07,961 --> 00:38:12,155
What do you think?
Can't you see for yourself?

470
00:38:12,296 --> 00:38:15,423
They made it with mud.

471
00:38:15,601 --> 00:38:17,294
So why are you asking, if you know?

472
00:38:17,399 --> 00:38:21,114
But why is it so stiff?

473
00:38:21,341 --> 00:38:25,009
Because it's a brick, what else?

474
00:38:28,633 --> 00:38:32,474
Can't we just tighten up 
the mud the same way?

475
00:38:33,884 --> 00:38:35,744
Tell me.

476
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:39,313
What do they use to tighten up bricks?

477
00:38:39,832 --> 00:38:41,405
Hardener.

478
00:38:42,235 --> 00:38:45,788
If you mix this hardener with the mud,

479
00:38:45,901 --> 00:38:48,173
it becomes as hard as rocks.

480
00:38:50,085 --> 00:38:52,556
Why couldn't I think of that?

481
00:38:52,756 --> 00:38:57,991
This.. this... Nam Youngchul
has lost it already.

482
00:38:58,309 --> 00:38:59,709
Let's try it out right away.

483
00:38:59,873 --> 00:39:02,930
I'm sure we'll be able
to do the same with roads.

484
00:39:03,083 --> 00:39:06,906
So, what, you're going to
spread bricks on the highway?

485
00:39:06,988 --> 00:39:10,571
Shut that trap and 
go get us that hardener.

486
00:39:10,678 --> 00:39:12,118
Get moving!

487
00:39:12,271 --> 00:39:14,283
- Hardener?
- Yeah. Hardener.

488
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,506
<i>- Hardener?
- Hard... Aigoo!</i>

489
00:39:16,612 --> 00:39:19,227
<i>- Hardener?!
- Just go.</i>

490
00:39:29,802 --> 00:39:30,966
Yes.

491
00:39:32,613 --> 00:39:33,872
That's me.

492
00:39:34,025 --> 00:39:35,543
What can I do for you?

493
00:39:35,731 --> 00:39:38,472
<i>There's a get-together
at the Royal Club tonight.</i>

494
00:39:38,802 --> 00:39:41,388
You know Congressman
Oh Byeongtak, right?

495
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:44,200
He'd like to meet you.

496
00:39:47,035 --> 00:39:48,294
No need to feel burdened,

497
00:39:48,435 --> 00:39:50,494
just come introduce yourself
and it'll be the end of things.

498
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:55,008
Getting acquainted with someone 
like him surely won't hurt.

499
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:58,775
<i>I'll leave right now,
so hurry up and come.</i>

500
00:39:59,584 --> 00:40:03,452
So I'll just come in a moment
and introduce myself.

501
00:40:36,137 --> 00:40:39,981
Lee Seongmo just left 
the ANSP building.

502
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:43,250
Where was he headed?

503
00:40:43,336 --> 00:40:45,330
I put some of our men on his trail,

504
00:40:45,636 --> 00:40:47,871
but we still don't know 
his destination.

505
00:40:49,224 --> 00:40:51,027
Where's Min Honggi now?

506
00:40:51,189 --> 00:40:52,824
We got word he's at the Royal Club.

507
00:40:52,942 --> 00:40:57,091
Let's head there right now.
Get the car.

508
00:40:57,726 --> 00:40:59,420
All right.

509
00:41:05,502 --> 00:41:11,302
That car behind us. Doesn't it 
feel like they've been trailing us?

510
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:13,690
Really?

511
00:41:14,232 --> 00:41:16,337
Why would anyone trail us?

512
00:41:16,526 --> 00:41:20,975
You said Chief Oh asked
about me and Min Honggi?

513
00:41:21,104 --> 00:41:23,245
Yes. But what would 
that have to do...

514
00:41:23,351 --> 00:41:27,904
Chief Oh and Jo Pilyeon 
are really close.

515
00:41:28,075 --> 00:41:29,328
Then...

516
00:41:29,504 --> 00:41:32,277
Are you suggesting that Jo Pilyeon
might be suspecting you?

517
00:41:32,442 --> 00:41:34,324
Take the next alley 
and go around the block.

518
00:41:34,477 --> 00:41:35,500
Yes.

519
00:41:47,987 --> 00:41:50,587
Seems like he still hasn't arrived.

520
00:41:52,434 --> 00:41:54,340
It can't be Seongmo.

521
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:57,881
No matter how you put it,
he'd have no reason to betray you.

522
00:41:57,999 --> 00:42:02,529
And if it indeed turns out he did?

523
00:42:02,835 --> 00:42:04,285
What?

524
00:42:04,892 --> 00:42:08,141
If Seongmo really betrayed me 
and is helping Min Honggi,

525
00:42:08,212 --> 00:42:09,659
what will you do?

526
00:42:09,823 --> 00:42:11,733
We'd obviously have to...

527
00:42:11,804 --> 00:42:13,851
Get rid of him.

528
00:42:18,015 --> 00:42:21,709
Gaining my trust is not that easy.

529
00:42:21,851 --> 00:42:27,560
However, once I trust someone,
I'm never the first to betray them.

530
00:42:27,936 --> 00:42:32,960
If it really turns out 
Seongmo betrayed me,

531
00:42:33,195 --> 00:42:35,807
I will not forgive him.

532
00:42:36,748 --> 00:42:42,746
I can only pray he won't 
show up here tonight.

533
00:42:45,377 --> 00:42:47,393
It's obvious they're trailing us.

534
00:42:47,569 --> 00:42:50,357
This won't do it,
let's return to the office.

535
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:52,815
Go to the Royal Club.

536
00:42:53,407 --> 00:42:54,572
Seonbaenim.

537
00:42:54,701 --> 00:42:56,148
I must meet Min Honggi.

538
00:42:56,254 --> 00:42:59,748
Don't you know that'll mean
falling right into their trap?

539
00:42:59,925 --> 00:43:02,278
Jo Pilyeon is already suspecting me.

540
00:43:03,495 --> 00:43:05,697
If I don't deal with this face to face,

541
00:43:05,815 --> 00:43:08,956
I'll never get out 
of Jo Pilyeon's shadows.

542
00:43:09,168 --> 00:43:10,250
But...

543
00:43:10,356 --> 00:43:12,156
Let's go!

544
00:43:36,198 --> 00:43:41,598
After all, Lee Seongmo was a traitor.

545
00:43:50,478 --> 00:43:52,090
What are you trying to do?

546
00:43:52,471 --> 00:43:54,761
Seongmo was like a son to me!

547
00:43:54,949 --> 00:43:57,745
And that same man betrayed me!

548
00:43:58,373 --> 00:44:01,232
- But, now is not...
- Let me go!

549
00:44:08,993 --> 00:44:15,654
So the man who was helping you 
is this Lee Seongmo?

550
00:44:15,751 --> 00:44:16,499
Yes.

551
00:44:16,558 --> 00:44:18,581
Both in terms of 
skills and disposition,

552
00:44:18,687 --> 00:44:22,582
he's a brilliant young fella
who could make it big in politics.

553
00:44:22,649 --> 00:44:26,296
They say there's nothing
like trustworthy disciples...

554
00:44:26,426 --> 00:44:29,920
Seems like you hit the jackpot
when it comes to that.

555
00:44:30,661 --> 00:44:34,085
This bodes well for 
the upcoming elections.

556
00:44:34,249 --> 00:44:36,045
My congratulations,
Congressman Min Honggi.

557
00:44:36,459 --> 00:44:38,353
"Congressman" Min Honggi...

558
00:44:38,448 --> 00:44:42,696
Rolls off the tongue, doesn't it?

559
00:44:43,085 --> 00:44:46,965
You're embarrassing me, come on...

560
00:44:47,104 --> 00:44:49,714
Here... Let's drink.

561
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:53,547
What's the matter?

562
00:44:53,655 --> 00:44:57,558
I was told to give you this, 
Candidate Min.

563
00:45:03,286 --> 00:45:07,260
<i>Forgive me for what I'm about to do.</i>

564
00:45:09,963 --> 00:45:12,236
What is it about?

565
00:45:17,268 --> 00:45:18,720
<i>What's with you?</i>

566
00:45:18,983 --> 00:45:21,323
How dare you come here?

567
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:24,909
You little...

568
00:45:28,733 --> 00:45:30,517
So I'd be your "right-hand man?"

569
00:45:30,694 --> 00:45:32,340
Is that the kind of rumor 
you spread to...

570
00:45:32,431 --> 00:45:34,742
drive a rift between 
me and Jo Pilyeon?

571
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:42,464
Stop it.

572
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:44,840
You better listen well.

573
00:45:44,969 --> 00:45:48,722
<i>Seems like you'll try every trick
in the book to win these elections,</i>

574
00:45:48,864 --> 00:45:50,930
but you'll never win.

575
00:45:51,021 --> 00:45:53,005
I'll never let you, is that clear?

576
00:45:53,087 --> 00:45:54,630
Seongmo!

577
00:45:54,741 --> 00:45:57,448
Take Seongmo out. Now.

578
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,257
What is this?

579
00:46:02,447 --> 00:46:03,951
What the hell 
are you people doing?

580
00:46:04,104 --> 00:46:05,080
My apologies.

581
00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:09,151
But that buddy 
can't tolerate injustice.

582
00:46:09,262 --> 00:46:10,796
What, injustice?!

583
00:46:10,949 --> 00:46:15,560
I'll soon take the opportunity
to formally apologize to you,

584
00:46:15,666 --> 00:46:18,813
but in the meantime, I ask
for your kind understanding.

585
00:46:18,903 --> 00:46:20,600
Hey, Jo Pilyeon!

586
00:46:20,708 --> 00:46:23,627
Just consider yourself lucky.

587
00:46:23,744 --> 00:46:28,538
If it weren't for me, 
he would have beaten you to a pulp.

588
00:46:39,758 --> 00:46:47,181
Isn't that the Lee Seongmo
Candidate Min was talking about?

589
00:46:59,217 --> 00:47:02,627
Seongmo, you'll have to keep
that temper of yours in check.

590
00:47:02,816 --> 00:47:04,380
Forgive me.

591
00:47:04,951 --> 00:47:09,533
I never imagined Min Honggi
could stab me in the back like that.

592
00:47:11,022 --> 00:47:15,212
But, what were you 
doing at the Royal Club?

593
00:47:15,295 --> 00:47:21,118
Actually, I'd heard people referring
to you as Min Honggi's right-hand man.

594
00:47:22,624 --> 00:47:24,542
I'll just be honest with you.

595
00:47:24,742 --> 00:47:26,777
For an ever so brief moment,

596
00:47:26,912 --> 00:47:29,253
I suspected you.

597
00:47:36,935 --> 00:47:38,665
Seongmo.

598
00:47:41,158 --> 00:47:41,981
And Jaechun.

599
00:47:42,075 --> 00:47:43,581
Yes.

600
00:47:45,169 --> 00:47:47,570
I might look like a vile,
ruthless opportunist,

601
00:47:47,675 --> 00:47:51,052
but I don't solely live for 
the sake of my personal gain.

602
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:54,548
You and I will walk
together to the very end.

603
00:47:55,042 --> 00:47:58,666
I'll never forget all your efforts.

604
00:47:58,807 --> 00:48:01,018
<i>Just endure these hardships 
a little longer.</i>

605
00:48:01,207 --> 00:48:03,854
It's on that new realm 
of ours in Gangnam...

606
00:48:03,936 --> 00:48:07,125
that our kingdom will be built.

607
00:48:08,407 --> 00:48:09,948
Here...

608
00:48:22,291 --> 00:48:24,056
<i>Did it work?</i>

609
00:48:24,221 --> 00:48:25,468
Just touch it and find out.

610
00:48:25,550 --> 00:48:30,002
Ehh Ehh... You wretched twat.
Will bring bad luck!

611
00:48:32,533 --> 00:48:34,835
I, Nam Youngchul!

612
00:48:35,461 --> 00:48:38,953
Put my thirty years of 
public works at stake for this.

613
00:48:39,512 --> 00:48:41,212
<i>If this doesn't work,</i>

614
00:48:41,376 --> 00:48:43,518
I'll just cut my hair,

615
00:48:43,870 --> 00:48:46,697
and retire to a temple for meditation.

616
00:48:46,808 --> 00:48:49,069
Why, have any hair left to cut?

617
00:48:49,179 --> 00:48:54,078
Ahh... You son of an anal wart,
you'll bring bad luck!

618
00:49:14,605 --> 00:49:17,304
My knee... 
I'll break my damned leg this way.

619
00:49:17,884 --> 00:49:19,501
We did it!

620
00:49:19,595 --> 00:49:22,171
It's done... We did it!

621
00:49:22,266 --> 00:49:24,466
We did it!

622
00:49:38,103 --> 00:49:40,349
What did you do with my hair?

623
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:41,890
Shut your mouth!

624
00:49:42,043 --> 00:49:45,573
You work at a club and still
have the guts to complain?

625
00:49:45,667 --> 00:49:48,043
Still, you cut my hair?

626
00:49:48,184 --> 00:49:50,184
It's all because of you!

627
00:49:50,514 --> 00:49:52,549
Will you shut that trap or not?

628
00:49:52,643 --> 00:49:56,551
If I had any scissors handy, your ears 
would be on the floor, your brat!

629
00:49:57,252 --> 00:50:00,052
Go ahead then! Who's stopping you?

630
00:50:00,169 --> 00:50:02,775
Ohh... Really! Come here!

631
00:50:02,981 --> 00:50:06,042
Stop it!

632
00:50:08,186 --> 00:50:09,891
Are there no side dishes?

633
00:50:09,987 --> 00:50:11,551
Anything to chew on...

634
00:50:11,739 --> 00:50:14,727
Is that what you worry about?

635
00:50:14,939 --> 00:50:18,150
Aigoo! I can't take it anymore!

636
00:50:22,361 --> 00:50:23,691
Yes.

637
00:50:24,585 --> 00:50:26,197
Agasshi?!

638
00:50:27,612 --> 00:50:28,938
Agasshi?

639
00:50:29,233 --> 00:50:30,044
Jeongyeon?

640
00:50:30,185 --> 00:50:31,902
'Course not.

641
00:50:32,417 --> 00:50:33,793
Yes.

642
00:50:33,914 --> 00:50:36,413
Yes, yes... Certainly.

643
00:50:49,654 --> 00:50:52,535
The shareholders' meeting 
will soon start.

644
00:50:58,096 --> 00:51:01,642
Shouldn't you go get Jeongyeon?

645
00:51:01,924 --> 00:51:09,465
I think it just wasn't in 
Jeongyeon's destiny to become my heir.

646
00:51:39,975 --> 00:51:42,056
Hurry up, Agasshi!

647
00:51:42,165 --> 00:51:44,998
You'll be late for the meeting!

648
00:51:49,732 --> 00:51:51,996
- What is the matter?
- What?

649
00:51:52,119 --> 00:51:54,332
I didn't say anything.

650
00:51:58,444 --> 00:51:59,997
Patients absent without leave...

651
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:02,915
It's not "leave," but discharge.

652
00:52:03,715 --> 00:52:05,725
Thank you for everything.

653
00:52:05,927 --> 00:52:07,786
Have a nice day.

654
00:52:09,278 --> 00:52:10,815
Have a nice day.

655
00:52:27,406 --> 00:52:30,446
You go ahead first.

656
00:52:36,664 --> 00:52:40,507
Whatever results 
today's meeting will bring,

657
00:52:40,695 --> 00:52:43,201
don't resent me.

658
00:52:44,572 --> 00:52:51,390
The verdict has already been
decided beyond my control.

659
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:58,848
You must give your support 
to Jeongyeon no matter what.

660
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:03,530
Seems like you're still not
fully aware of the situation.

661
00:53:03,672 --> 00:53:06,530
<i>Oh my! You're here?</i>

662
00:53:09,813 --> 00:53:10,921
Nice to meet you.

663
00:53:11,309 --> 00:53:14,438
You give quite a different
vibe outside that club?

664
00:53:15,709 --> 00:53:18,827
Have you two met before?

665
00:53:18,932 --> 00:53:20,485
<i>We sure did!</i>

666
00:53:20,641 --> 00:53:23,250
<i>Think I wouldn't know the
owner of the Royal Club?</i>

667
00:53:23,403 --> 00:53:25,852
She's a company shareholder.

668
00:53:26,348 --> 00:53:28,358
Shall we enter?

669
00:53:42,983 --> 00:53:45,452
It's really too bad for Jeongyeon.

670
00:53:45,993 --> 00:53:50,228
And after going through all that abuse, 
I can't even get a chance?

671
00:53:50,563 --> 00:53:51,851
You just wait.

672
00:53:51,992 --> 00:53:57,592
This shareholders' meeting will mark
the very last time my father ignores me.

673
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:08,402
Hwang Jeongyeon.

674
00:54:08,576 --> 00:54:10,449
Why would you even come here?

675
00:54:11,703 --> 00:54:14,731
Just because it's 
a shareholders' meeting?

676
00:54:14,896 --> 00:54:16,242
And what would you do here?

677
00:54:16,337 --> 00:54:19,066
You'll wiggle that trap 
like a roach and then leave?

678
00:54:19,184 --> 00:54:20,866
Give it a rest.

679
00:54:23,242 --> 00:54:25,305
Are you feeling better?

680
00:54:27,974 --> 00:54:30,678
<i>Oh well... All the better.</i>

681
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:33,996
You at least can 
clap your hands, right?

682
00:54:34,231 --> 00:54:36,454
When they announce me as the heir,

683
00:54:36,572 --> 00:54:38,937
you can join in and give me
an applause like everyone else.

684
00:54:46,803 --> 00:54:49,226
Where are you trying to go?

685
00:55:01,037 --> 00:55:05,801
And I hope it'll also be the very 
last time you act like a pompous prick.

686
00:55:22,465 --> 00:55:25,463
<i>So, what, still banking on
that last thread of hope?</i>

687
00:55:25,616 --> 00:55:27,922
<i>Sure... Be my guest.</i>

688
00:55:28,051 --> 00:55:31,440
<i>I'll embarrass you in front of 
everyone and have them kick you out.</i>

689
00:55:46,653 --> 00:55:50,487
We will now start today's
shareholders' meeting...

690
00:55:50,594 --> 00:55:53,199
to decide Manbo Construction's heir.

691
00:55:53,315 --> 00:55:55,862
<i>Every shareholder is entitled
to exercise their voting rights...</i>

692
00:55:55,921 --> 00:55:57,651
<i>based on their holding rate.</i>

693
00:55:58,015 --> 00:56:05,142
Before the voting, a Q&A session with
the two candidates will take place.

694
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:09,318
We already know 
everything there is to know.

695
00:56:09,495 --> 00:56:12,347
<i>What's the point of
going through all that?</i>

696
00:56:12,434 --> 00:56:13,530
That's right.

697
00:56:13,671 --> 00:56:17,683
Let's not waste our precious time
and just start voting right away.

698
00:56:17,812 --> 00:56:18,777
<i>Let's do that.</i>

699
00:56:18,907 --> 00:56:20,518
<i>Let's vote.</i>

700
00:56:20,883 --> 00:56:24,836
Then, if there are no objections,
we will vote right away.

701
00:56:26,095 --> 00:56:28,159
I will ask a question, if I may.

702
00:56:30,539 --> 00:56:34,539
Birds of the same 
feather flock together.

703
00:56:34,657 --> 00:56:36,022
Please, go ahead.

704
00:56:36,763 --> 00:56:40,410
First, I'll ask Hwang Jeongshik.

705
00:56:40,815 --> 00:56:43,132
<i>What is the current 
financial state of the company,</i>

706
00:56:43,262 --> 00:56:48,815
and how much can shareholders
expect in dividends this year?

707
00:57:04,986 --> 00:57:07,000
That...

708
00:57:07,846 --> 00:57:12,553
Manbo Construction's
current financial situation...

709
00:57:13,402 --> 00:57:15,200
is quite positive.

710
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:20,612
So it's only natural that you will be 
satisfied with your dividends this year.

711
00:57:20,698 --> 00:57:22,956
Very satisfied.

712
00:57:24,509 --> 00:57:28,038
I'll ask the same question
to Miss Jeongyeon as well.

713
00:57:28,238 --> 00:57:29,944
Go ahead and tell us.

714
00:57:53,229 --> 00:57:56,252
Just in case anyone 
is not aware as of yet,

715
00:57:56,617 --> 00:58:01,308
- she's suffering from aphasia...
- If I may speak!

716
00:58:15,837 --> 00:58:19,943
Manbo Construction's current assets 
total 473 billion won,

717
00:58:20,014 --> 00:58:23,202
with 162.7 billion won in liabilities.

718
00:58:23,723 --> 00:58:27,099
<i>This year's predicted total
revenues are 126 billion won,</i>

719
00:58:27,373 --> 00:58:30,911
<i>with profits of 47.4 billion won.</i>

720
00:58:31,064 --> 00:58:32,894
Park Gidong Seonsaengnim?

721
00:58:33,443 --> 00:58:35,754
You own 100,000 of our shares, 
if I recall correctly?

722
00:58:36,111 --> 00:58:37,429
That'd be right.

723
00:58:37,523 --> 00:58:42,180
You will then receive 550 million
won in dividends this year.

724
00:58:42,663 --> 00:58:46,769
That's a 350 million-won
growth year-on-year.

725
00:58:48,746 --> 00:58:50,545
<i>Choi Taeseop Seonsaengnim?</i>

726
00:58:50,639 --> 00:58:53,789
You own 50,000 shares, right?

727
00:58:53,894 --> 00:58:55,935
Yes... That's... right.

728
00:58:56,040 --> 00:59:00,229
Your dividend growth will
be 175 million year-on-year.

729
00:59:00,346 --> 00:59:02,711
<i>Congratulations.</i>

730
00:59:03,279 --> 00:59:11,230
I think we need to verify whether
Miss Hwang Jeongyeon's claims are true.

731
00:59:11,522 --> 00:59:13,420
Chief Jo Minwoo?

732
00:59:14,608 --> 00:59:19,729
I kindly ask you to confirm to the shareholders 
whether my calculations were right.

733
00:59:22,712 --> 00:59:28,336
It is right as Hwang Jeongyeon said.

734
00:59:31,453 --> 00:59:33,576
<i>As a fellow candidate,</i>

735
00:59:33,729 --> 00:59:37,058
<i>I'd like to ask Director
Hwang Jeongshik a question.</i>

736
00:59:38,092 --> 00:59:41,270
I'd like you to tell us about the difficulties 
our highway construction is facing,

737
00:59:41,470 --> 00:59:45,439
along with any possible
solutions to the matter.

738
00:59:51,462 --> 00:59:53,498
Hey... Minwoo...

739
00:59:59,648 --> 01:00:04,993
Road construction is truly a
crucial sector for our company.

740
01:00:05,652 --> 01:00:09,452
But it's going perfectly fine,

741
01:00:09,634 --> 01:00:11,827
<i>if you must necessarily
find a problem with it...</i>

742
01:00:11,909 --> 01:00:14,627
A construction that should have
gone past 40-percent completion...

743
01:00:14,744 --> 01:00:17,060
barely went past half that figure,

744
01:00:17,168 --> 01:00:20,450
but you're still suggesting
everything is "going perfectly fine?"

745
01:00:42,739 --> 01:00:46,433
<i>We will now begin the voting.</i>

746
01:01:30,926 --> 01:01:32,218
Sorry about that.

747
01:01:32,382 --> 01:01:34,794
I had to finish watering my pots.

748
01:01:35,759 --> 01:01:37,280
Have a seat.

749
01:01:41,912 --> 01:01:49,068
So, did you develop this new
technology for road construction?

750
01:01:49,259 --> 01:01:56,663
I just came back from filing 
a public works patent request.

751
01:02:17,977 --> 01:02:20,212
I will announce the results.

752
01:02:20,989 --> 01:02:23,267
By a margin of 68 to 32 percent,

753
01:02:23,397 --> 01:02:26,279
the new heir of Manbo Construction...

754
01:02:38,732 --> 01:02:41,391
will be Miss Hwang Jeongyeon.

755
01:03:19,517 --> 01:03:20,954
Mom...

756
01:03:25,930 --> 01:03:27,541
<i>What's wrong with you?</i>

757
01:03:27,765 --> 01:03:29,871
Get a hold of yourself.

758
01:04:25,118 --> 01:04:27,289
Whether you'll choose
this land deed as collateral,

759
01:04:27,441 --> 01:04:30,277
or my business plan instead,

760
01:04:30,624 --> 01:04:32,983
I leave the decision to you.

761
01:04:33,841 --> 01:04:36,686
How much are you looking for?

762
01:04:37,568 --> 01:04:39,653
I'd like to borrow 
five hundred million.

763
01:04:39,945 --> 01:04:41,468
Listen to that.

764
01:04:41,780 --> 01:04:45,051
Not a penny of interest, 
and 500 million?

765
01:04:48,904 --> 01:04:55,154
If I choose your
business plan as collateral?

766
01:04:55,414 --> 01:04:59,660
You'd eventually be rewarded with 
immense dividends down the line.

767
01:05:01,028 --> 01:05:03,487
And if I choose 
the land deed instead?

768
01:05:04,087 --> 01:05:08,369
I no longer need you.

769
01:05:10,028 --> 01:05:12,487
Choose one of the two.

771

777
01:05:37,192 --> 01:05:40,427
<i>Are you telling me  
he met with Go Jaechun?</i>

778
01:05:40,533 --> 01:05:41,133
<i>You just wait.</i>

779
01:05:41,204 --> 01:05:44,757
While everyone bets on my downfall,
I'll shock them all and turn this around.

780
01:05:44,839 --> 01:05:47,440
- I'd like to go out with you.
- I already have a boyfriend.

781
01:05:47,531 --> 01:05:50,512
He works for Manbo Construction,
and is already a chief there.

782
01:05:50,665 --> 01:05:53,429
It's my letter of resignation,
giving up my rights as heir.

783
01:05:53,535 --> 01:05:57,006
<i>If this project fails, I will 
present this letter to the chairman.</i>

784
01:05:57,100 --> 01:06:00,033
We will use this new technology
to fight off those corporations.

785
01:06:00,127 --> 01:06:02,010
Do you mean Manbo Construction?

786
01:06:02,104 --> 01:06:03,869
Dig into this Hangang
Construction right away.

787
01:06:03,951 --> 01:06:06,974
<i>Find out who runs that company!</i>
