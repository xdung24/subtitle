[To Dear Myself]

2
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:32,600
[Ep14]

3
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,480
Go

4
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,640
Today is great

5
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,599
Yes

6
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:49,040
The most important thing is to be happy

7
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:53,000
Being rich comes second

8
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,959
Be happy

9
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,640
Xiaoling

10
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,079
I want to discuss something with you

11
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,920
What?

12
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,120
Be my girlfriend

13
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,680
I promise you

14
00:02:07,325 --> 00:02:10,599
I will be a successful man

15
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:20,800
Ok?

16
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:26,000
Lei Haowen

17
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:28,240
I see you as brother

18
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,680
You...

19
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:33,919
You even habor this clever idea

20
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:38,266
No

21
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,599
What's wrong?

22
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:45,360
Give you...

23
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:52,400
But I don't want to be your brother

24
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,800
Then you are nothing

25
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,520
Nothing else?

26
00:02:58,039 --> 00:02:59,319
You can be my BFF

27
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,840
All right...

28
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:02,919
Ok, BFF

29
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:05,560
Be careful

30
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,319
My shoes

31
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,360
Raise your arms

32
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:13,240
One, two, again

33
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:17,199
One, one, two

34
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:20,879
Two, one, two

35
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:23,120
Raise arms

36
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,039
One, two, one, two

37
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:33,919
I'm sorry

38
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,000
Ok  -Take a break

39
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,080
When do you get here?

40
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:44,439
Just now

41
00:04:03,675 --> 00:04:05,840
As I know, you have dinner with president Wang tonight

42
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,360
I come here after the dinner

43
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,675
I feel confused after sister Ziru talks to me today

44
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:27,500
But sister Ziru also encourages me

45
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:30,000
So I am here

46
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,199
Really?

47
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,120
Yiming

48
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:38,079
I won't leave Shanghai

49
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,800
Why?

50
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:46,399
First

51
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,225
My competition with sister Yuan is not over yet

52
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:51,600
Second

53
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,925
Even if I lose and leave Lubao

54
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,199
I won't leave Shanghai either

55
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:02,560
Yiming

56
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:04,680
Don't go

57
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,279
We should stick together

58
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,879
I need to get changed

59
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,839
Traffic jam again

60
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,199
Traffic jams everywhere in this city

61
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:14,600
High house prices, high cost of living

62
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,439
We can't save money

63
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,120
The air is not good

64
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,480
That's not all

65
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,000
It's hard to succeed

66
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,240
Easy to fail

67
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:28,439
But we have chances here

68
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,439
Siyu

69
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:37,439
Now I have a good chance

70
00:06:40,325 --> 00:06:44,900
We study hard and get admitted to the college

71
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,480
We go to the good colleges

72
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,639
All we want is to go to a place good for our development

73
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,399
And want to see the world, right?

74
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:55,680
We get the hang of it here

75
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,600
Why should we go back now?

76
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,475
You think we get hang of it

77
00:07:04,475 --> 00:07:08,350
It's nothing in this city

78
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,759
We have worked hard here for seven years

79
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:18,125
The money, status and resources we have can't stand consumption

80
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,839
Yiming

81
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,591
What you are going through now is just temporary

82
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,120
It will be the past

83
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:27,350
Our past superiority is temporary

84
00:07:32,575 --> 00:07:37,025
If you have some problem in life,

85
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,240
we won't buy the house for the time being

86
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:43,350
We have enough income to live here

87
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,319
Siyu

88
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,319
It's not true that I can't live in Shanghai

89
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,600
I just have no self-confidence here

90
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,675
If I still stay here, I am afraid I will lose the last bit of dignity

91
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:05,519
Not so serious, right?

92
00:08:07,175 --> 00:08:10,550
You know why I don't go to president Guo's company?

93
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,079
Because I'm stingy

94
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,480
I am narrow-minded

95
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:18,519
I am skeptical

96
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,279
Why do I become like this?

97
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:23,959
Because I feel inferior

98
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,480
I'm afraid of losing you

99
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,920
I really hate

100
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,000
I hate becoming like this

101
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,822
But if I still stay in Shanghai like this,

102
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,799
I will hate myself so much

103
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:55,550
But if you have to leave, we will be separated

104
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,240
Yiming

105
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,600
Stay

106
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:09,440
Siyu

107
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,919
Go with me

108
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:29,159
The car is here

109
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,120
Let me walk you there

110
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:52,159
Just this one

111
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:53,960
Come

112
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,039
Is that you?

113
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:01,679
Correct

114
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:03,360
Driver, be careful

115
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,279
Ok, no problem

116
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:36,759
Yiming

117
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,240
Stay

118
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,360
Siyu

119
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:45,200
Go with me

120
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,159
Morning, sister Siyu

121
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:54,559
Morning

122
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,039
Lin Ling

123
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:05,960
Sister Siyu

124
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,679
Where are they?

125
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,639
They say, we will lose

126
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,279
And you won't come

127
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:15,440
So they are having a holiday

128
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,039
Why you are still here?

129
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,300
I know you won't surrender so easily

130
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:25,399
Tell them

131
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:26,519
We will have a meeting immediately

132
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:27,200
Ok

133
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:32,440
Sister Siyu is back

134
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,559
Everyone, come back for meeting

135
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:34,320
Hurry...

136
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:39,399
Liu Xiaojia

137
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:41,639
You think we are destined to lose?

138
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:43,000
And you give yourself a holiday?

139
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,300
You don't contact the clients

140
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:47,919
And you just forget the contract

141
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,559
No

142
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,240
Let me tell you

143
00:12:52,475 --> 00:12:55,279
We can't give up until we meet the deadline

144
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:57,639
Before that, we still have a chance

145
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:00,120
But...

146
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,240
But what?

147
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,279
You think they lead us by more than 20 million

148
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,480
So we will lose to them right?

149
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:08,320
No

150
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:10,799
Yes, I think so, too

151
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:14,240
We still can't give up so easily

152
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,600
We can lose this round

153
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,120
But we just can't give up on ourselves

154
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,080
Correct

155
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,919
We need to persist, can't give up

156
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:22,000
Did you persist?

157
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,120
Did you give up?

158
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,360
Yeah

159
00:13:26,575 --> 00:13:29,200
You think it's persistence when you make 30 calls every day?

160
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,120
I can tell you

161
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,000
You make 30 calls today

162
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,679
35 calls tomorrow

163
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:32,399
40 the day after tomorrow

164
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:33,360
That's persistence

165
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:36,810
Cheer up

166
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:39,440
Sister Siyu, don't worry

167
00:13:39,675 --> 00:13:41,039
We are in high spirits now

168
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:42,519
High spirits

169
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:43,399
High spirits

170
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:44,399
High spirits

171
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:47,750
Siyu, come out

172
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:56,120
What happened?

173
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,975
Yuan Huizhong pockets our company's 

174
00:13:58,975 --> 00:14:01,050
battery of over 5 million in collusion

175
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:02,919
It can't be

176
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:04,759
Who did she collude with?

177
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,639
As I know, it's Meiyi Group

178
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:09,425
Meiyi Group?

179
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:11,840
President Pan asked legal department to investigate this

180
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,300
They say, business license, offices, official website

181
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,120
and news links

182
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,600
They are all fake

183
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:19,360
What?

184
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,000
The battery of over 4 million is my responsibility

185
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:23,279
According to company regulations

186
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,320
I will accept all the punishment

187
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:27,875
But I really didn't betray the company

188
00:14:28,775 --> 00:14:30,519
In front of me and Pan Zhiyong

189
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:32,799
you said, you knew each other

190
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:34,200
I...

191
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,840
I just said it causally

192
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,879
I also believed your words

193
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,399
I am your side witness

194
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,759
Legal department has called the police

195
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,440
They are investigating this

196
00:14:46,675 --> 00:14:48,840
I went to Meiyi Group's office

197
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,879
I also met the director of the office

198
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,120
Did you lose anything?

199
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:55,240
The order belonged to Lin Ling

200
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:57,559
But sister Yuan took it

201
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,000
She deserves it

202
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,120
But sister Yuan is also a victim

203
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:02,960
No

204
00:15:03,575 --> 00:15:06,720
As I know she knows the fraud for many years

205
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,600
So she colluded with him

206
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:10,799
No

207
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:13,275
Sister Yuan doesn't know the fraud

208
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,879
Liu Jie can testify

209
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:18,360
I saw the fraud for the first time on that day

210
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,159
Liu Jie is in your team

211
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:22,159
Will anyone believe what she says?

212
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,601
Li Siyu and Lin Ling were there, too

213
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:31,720
Will they speak for you?

214
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:35,919
Where are you going?

215
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,639
I need to see preisdent Pan

216
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:38,879
I need to explain this

217
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:41,399
You want to help her?

218
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,200
You forgot what she did to you?

219
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,919
But she is innocent

220
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:47,240
She scapegoated you enough

221
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,639
Don't be stupid

222
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:50,399
The company has rules

223
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:52,799
If she is deceived,

224
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:53,639
Four million

225
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,919
she just needs to pay 400,000

226
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:58,720
But if she colludes with others at the company's expense

227
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,440
she will be fired

228
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,480
But sister Yuan didn't collude with others at company's expense

229
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,759
She just made a mistake

230
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,750
As I know, president Pan is sure 

231
00:16:10,775 --> 00:16:12,775
she acts in cahoots with the frauds

232
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
And he wants to fire her

233
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,639
Fang Zhan has been monitoring there

234
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:21,840
They have quarreled many times

235
00:16:22,325 --> 00:16:25,890
If you come out, you will invite troubles for President Pan

236
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,600
They grabbed my order

237
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:32,600
In the end, they invited a disaster for themselves

238
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:37,200
So great

239
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,559
Lin Ling

240
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,350
When you contacted director Luo, 

241
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:43,480
did you find something strange?

242
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,500
Director Luo is a little weird

243
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,679
Why?

244
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,679
He often disappears

245
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:54,120
He likes bragging

246
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:57,402
So Liu Jie gave up after talking to him twice

247
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,519
How did he negotiate the contract with you?

248
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:06,359
He doesn't care much about the price

249
00:17:06,598 --> 00:17:08,318
But the only requirement is

250
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,400
after paying the deposit

251
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,880
we need to ship all batteries

252
00:17:11,724 --> 00:17:14,118
Our project has a tight schedule

253
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,759
So we don't have time to urge the shippment

254
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,039
How about this?

255
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:22,079
After I pay the deposit,

256
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,880
you should send me the batteries

257
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:26,440
Within this week

258
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,640
I will give you the rest money

259
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:30,480
Ok?

260
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:36,400
I'm afraid I can't

261
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:52,125
I remember manager Li Siyu wants to talk to you

262
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,000
I don't know if she has the final say

263
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,960
Director Luo

264
00:17:58,839 --> 00:17:59,519
How about this?

265
00:18:01,275 --> 00:18:03,279
You need to pay 20% advance payment

266
00:18:05,225 --> 00:18:09,525
I will cooperate with you on the subsequent payment method

267
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:12,599
But I have a condition

268
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,599
We need to sign the contract now

269
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,160
Ok, no problem

270
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,000
No wonder

271
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,119
Sister Yuan signed a contract with him immediately

272
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:23,079
With a good price

273
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:26,800
I think, sister Yuan made concessions on the shipping method

274
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,039
We were so close

275
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,720
Lin Ling

276
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,720
Do you think we should prove sister Yuan's innocence?

277
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,359
Why?

278
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:46,119
President Pan is sure sister Yuan colluded with director Luo

279
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:47,400
He wants to fire her

280
00:18:48,025 --> 00:18:50,680
But we know they don't know each other

281
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:54,680
Sister Siyu

282
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,600
You should go without me, anyway

283
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,839
Lin Ling

284
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:04,625
Don't forget what they did to us

285
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:10,680
Go back

286
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,160
She deserves it

287
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,880
You want to see me?

288
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:16,599
President Pan

289
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:17,480
I want to see you, too

290
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:18,880
Come in

291
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:25,720
Sit

292
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:33,119
You know what happened to Yuan Huizhong, right?

293
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,359
Yes

294
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:37,920
So she can't stay in our company now

295
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,075
So I will leave the government project 

296
00:20:40,075 --> 00:20:42,776
and sales department to you

297
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,480
Me?

298
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,799
Yes, you

299
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,800
You should get prepared to take charge of sales department

300
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,720
President Pan

301
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:57,799
How will you punish sister Yuan?

302
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:03,440
She benefits at our expense

303
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,519
She will be fired

304
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:07,000
No one can change it

305
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:10,200
So you should get yourself prepared

306
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,119
Why do you want to see me?

307
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,920
No

308
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:26,839
Sister Siyu

309
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,680
Come in

310
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:03,960
Why close the door?

311
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,759
Sister Siyu

312
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:09,119
What happened?

313
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:11,480
Tomorrow, they will announce, you are the sales director

314
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:12,880
Who told you that?

315
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,079
The whole office knows this

316
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:15,000
You know what, sister...

317
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,720
Kuaizi looks down on me

318
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,119
He called me sister Jia just now

319
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,599
He is older than you, right?

320
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:22,475
My boss defeats his boss

321
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:26,000
And more than that, sister

322
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:28,680
Huang Bibo and others are very worried

323
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,850
if you will fire them after you become sales director

324
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:34,920
Zhang Ziting, Liu Jie and others are looking for a new job

325
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,079
Why do this?

326
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,000
You win this time

327
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,300
If they win, we will lose jobs

328
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,640
Sister Siyu

329
00:22:43,925 --> 00:22:46,160
I think we should celebrate it in advance

330
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,200
Not even close

331
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:47,920
Celebrate what?

332
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,079
Tell everyone

333
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:49,960
Stop the rumors

334
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,119
Anything else?

335
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,000
Back to work now

336
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,920
Ten o'clock tomorrow morning

337
00:23:31,575 --> 00:23:33,559
We will talk about the punishment for you

338
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:37,925
Testimony of Li Siyu and Lin Ling is vital

339
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:50,359
Li Siyu

340
00:23:50,359 --> 00:23:52,920
We are like The Snake and the Farmer

341
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:55,599
I will be the sales director

342
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,900
I will be the sales director

343
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,279
What are you thinking about?

344
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:49,359
Go to supervision department immediately

345
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:50,759
Or go to see president Pan

346
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,359
Tell him what you know

347
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,079
Or go directly to see sister Yuan

348
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,075
Tell her you can prove her innocence

349
00:24:59,875 --> 00:25:01,880
It's not good for me

350
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,240
But you should do so

351
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,519
If I do this,

352
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:07,240
sister Yuan can stay in the company

353
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:10,079
If she stays in the company, she will bid on behalf of Lubao

354
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:12,119
If she wins the bid, she will be the sales director

355
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,200
What about me?

356
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,559
I have to leave Lubao

357
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:15,440
So be it

358
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,400
What are you afraid of?

359
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,720
You can go to other companies

360
00:25:19,125 --> 00:25:20,680
Or we can go back to my hometown together

361
00:25:20,925 --> 00:25:23,650
You will be the sales director in Zhu Xiaobai's company

362
00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:26,975
You just want me to leave here and go back with you

363
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,240
Li Siyu

364
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,480
This is your opinion of me?

365
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,475
Then why do you tell me to do this?

366
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:40,599
Because it's a right thing to do

367
00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:44,640
It's not just about right or wrong

368
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,559
I know things are complicated

369
00:25:47,225 --> 00:25:49,839
But you can be very simple

370
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:51,720
What?

371
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,839
It's about my future

372
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,920
It's even about my subordinates' future

373
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,839
It's about president Pan

374
00:25:55,839 --> 00:25:57,039
It's even about Lubao

375
00:25:58,675 --> 00:26:02,825
Let me tell you this, it's best that sister Yuan leaves

376
00:26:05,319 --> 00:26:06,480
But she can't leave like this

377
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:08,279
She wants me to leave like this

378
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:13,400
You should win her, fair and square

379
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:17,440
It's the way you are

380
00:26:30,279 --> 00:26:31,200
Sister Yuan's call

381
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,559
For yourself

382
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,440
You have to do this

383
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,279
I have to?

384
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,559
Sister Yuan

385
00:27:51,799 --> 00:27:58,250
Rumor has it that I am in collusion with the fraud

386
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,359
You said it yourself

387
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:06,800
But you know it's not true

388
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:16,559
Ten o'clock tomorrow morning

389
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
They discuss whether to fire me?

390
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,400
Siyu

391
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,160
You need to prove my innocence

392
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,279
I can't be fired

393
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,600
I can't be fired because of this kind of thing

394
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:42,720
Siyu

395
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:46,119
Help me

396
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:52,799
I can help you explain the truth

397
00:28:56,839 --> 00:28:58,680
But you have to give me the truth

398
00:28:59,039 --> 00:28:59,680
What?

399
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:05,079
I filed the government bid first

400
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:05,839
Not you

401
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,440
I can do anything for you

402
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:11,799
Except this

403
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,240
Why?

404
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,720
It's my sales performance

405
00:29:16,575 --> 00:29:19,880
Who gets the bid will win

406
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:21,880
Not entirely

407
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:30,480
What you want is not sales performance

408
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,584
You want to be the sales director?

409
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,559
Whatever you think

410
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,400
I just want to take whatever belongs to me

411
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,240
I ask you to prove my innocence, because I want to stay in Lubao

412
00:29:59,875 --> 00:30:02,400
So I could become the sales director

413
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:06,625
If you bargain with me, what's the point of it that I stay in Lubao?

414
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,240
At least we have justice

415
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,480
Let me tell you what justice is

416
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,160
I sacrificed so much, so I should be the sales director

417
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,200
This is justice

418
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,480
What about my justice?

419
00:30:23,105 --> 00:30:24,599
You took my clients one by one

420
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:26,039
Where is my justice?

421
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:27,240
You shouldn't be against me

422
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:31,079
That's because you forced me

423
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,920
Will you help me tomorrow?

424
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:48,150
If you help me, let bygones be bygones

425
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,960
Give the government bid back to me

426
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:56,240
Li Siyu

427
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,319
Ask you one last time

428
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,960
Will you help me?

429
00:31:08,359 --> 00:31:11,775
Give the government bid back to me

430
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,200
How's it?

431
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,925
If you give her the bid,

432
00:31:49,925 --> 00:31:53,295
you won't be the sales director

433
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,200
But after tomorrow's meeting

434
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,559
I will leave Lubao, till then I have no chance

435
00:31:58,079 --> 00:31:58,759
Who said that?

436
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:03,625
The result of tomorrow's meeting is to be determined

437
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,200
Brother

438
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:14,839
I can't stay in Lubao anymore

439
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:16,880
Don't worry

440
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:18,400
You have me

441
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,279
Come in

442
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:20,880
Sister Siyu

443
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,200
When will we go?

444
00:33:24,599 --> 00:33:25,400
Eleven o'clock

445
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,279
Ok

446
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,799
Hello, sister Siyu

447
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:40,880
Zhizhi

448
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,920
Ten o'clock meeting

449
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,000
In which meeting room?

450
00:33:44,599 --> 00:33:45,400
Wait a moment

451
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:47,720
10 o'clock

452
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:49,240
Conference Room 1

453
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:50,839
I get it

454
00:34:12,039 --> 00:34:13,159
You really want to go?

455
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,400
Lin Ling, what's wrong with you?

456
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:22,440
What's up with her?

457
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,719
I am writing a resignation letter

458
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:27,760
Why resign?

459
00:34:30,518 --> 00:34:33,959
I worked overtime last night

460
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,199
Vice president Fang talked to me

461
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,000
Sorry

462
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,679
I can't help sister Yuan

463
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:46,400
Lin Ling

464
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,239
I didn't tell you to lie

465
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:50,360
You just need to tell the truth

466
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:56,280
If Yuan Huizhong leaves because of this

467
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,960
won't you feel guilty?

468
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,480
Vice president Fang

469
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,440
I am sister Siyu's subordinate

470
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:07,760
I will do and say as sister Siyu says

471
00:35:08,519 --> 00:35:09,320
Lin Ling

472
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:18,119
I know, you know the fraud

473
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:23,599
You will be the first to be held accountable

474
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,519
Vice president Fang

475
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,480
I don't know what you are talking about

476
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,199
Don't forget

477
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,960
I'm the vice president of the company

478
00:35:37,175 --> 00:35:40,800
You think she can cover you up?

479
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,400
So you resign?

480
00:35:56,679 --> 00:35:58,725
I will never speak for them

481
00:35:59,725 --> 00:36:02,054
I know they will retaliate

482
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,599
Feiyu battery tried to poach me days ago

483
00:36:09,719 --> 00:36:11,159
I didn't plan to go

484
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:15,719
But now it's my way out

485
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:17,960
How's your resignation letter?

486
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:21,400
I just begin it

487
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,960
You will bow to them?

488
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,199
I will not bow

489
00:36:34,519 --> 00:36:35,599
You don't have to resign

490
00:36:35,975 --> 00:36:38,320
Fang doesn't have the final say

491
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:40,679
Ok

492
00:36:50,679 --> 00:36:51,159
Xiao Tian

493
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:52,559
Go

494
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,679
Go to see the client with me

495
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,800
We should leave at 11 o'clock

496
00:36:56,199 --> 00:36:56,960
I changed my mind

497
00:37:45,079 --> 00:37:46,280
What are you doing?

498
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,320
I will send these back with express delivery

499
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,400
So I am packing up

500
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:56,039
You still go?

501
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:58,480
Yeah

502
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,840
I promised Zhu Xiaobai

503
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,925
I will go to work within half a month

504
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,119
What's the end to sister Yuan?

505
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:22,199
I did not say anything

506
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:24,159
Why?

507
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,000
Because she doesn't deserve it

508
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,119
You do that for yourself not for her

509
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:35,880
I know

510
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:38,679
You hope me to be kind and righteous

511
00:38:39,125 --> 00:38:40,960
But what have I got?

512
00:38:41,559 --> 00:38:46,360
I got her suspicion and scapegoat with my kindness 

513
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,600
In the end, I got nothing

514
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:50,280
But at least you have a clear conscience

515
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,719
What's the use of it?

516
00:38:51,719 --> 00:38:54,468
I would have been kicked out without president Pan

517
00:38:56,775 --> 00:39:02,150
So you want to answer blows with blows?

518
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:04,480
I didn't harm her

519
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,159
I just keep silent

520
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,519
But it's a disgraceful win

521
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,189
As long as I am the final winner, it's a big victory

522
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:13,679
Victory is so important?

523
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:15,800
If victory is not important, why do you leave Shanghai?

524
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,159
Because in Shanghai, you think you are a loser

525
00:39:19,159 --> 00:39:21,119
You lost all your confidence

526
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:55,519
Sorry

527
00:39:57,039 --> 00:39:57,800
Yiming

528
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,920
I don't think you are a loser

529
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:06,159
I don't have the right to tell you what to do

530
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,480
You are disappointed in me?

531
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,199
I am disappointed in myself

532
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:20,360
Just go back if you want

533
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:34,360
So we...

534
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:35,639
Long distance relationship

535
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:38,960
Long distance relationship?

536
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:43,599
I won't leave you anyway

537
00:40:50,519 --> 00:40:51,280
Zhizhi

538
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,000
I don't want to go

539
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,599
You must go

540
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,760
You just go with Yuwei

541
00:41:02,025 --> 00:41:04,960
We must attend the party together

542
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,159
It's attitude

543
00:41:06,975 --> 00:41:09,559
It shows we attach great importance to kid's education

544
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,679
It also shows the respect of the party organizer

545
00:41:15,225 --> 00:41:19,499
But I am so sick of Miaomiao's face

546
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:21,400
That was before

547
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,920
We have a good relationship now

548
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,320
I need to work

549
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,400
Why give me that look?

550
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:53,119
You are almost beyond recognition

551
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:58,320
How do I look?

552
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:01,280
Great

553
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,880
Mom looks great

554
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,480
Let's go

555
00:42:06,679 --> 00:42:07,199
Come

556
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,719
Let's go play there

557
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,440
Easy

558
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:18,159
Welcome

559
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:19,239
You guys, be careful

560
00:42:19,239 --> 00:42:20,280
Miaomiao, Linda

561
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,079
Let's go play there

562
00:42:25,639 --> 00:42:26,400
Be careful

563
00:42:26,519 --> 00:42:27,239
Xingxing's mom

564
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:28,920
You are here

565
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,000
Where's Xingxing's dad?

566
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:30,840
He...

567
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,440
He is chatting with William's dad

568
00:42:34,519 --> 00:42:35,800
They are alumni of Ivy League

569
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:38,760
Yuwei's dad

570
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,679
You graduate from American college?

571
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:42,960
Which one?

572
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,239
Xingxing's dad is looking for you, right?

573
00:42:45,639 --> 00:42:47,119
No, never mind him

574
00:42:47,825 --> 00:42:51,000
You get your undergraduate and master's degrees in U.S.?

575
00:42:51,159 --> 00:42:52,000
Actually...

576
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,480
Acutally it's the obscure colleges

577
00:42:55,125 --> 00:42:58,000
It's so hard to mention in front of Xingxing's dad

578
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:05,100
They say my party is much classier than Vivian's sorority

579
00:43:05,542 --> 00:43:06,519
What Vivian?

580
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:07,840
You know Vivian?

581
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:08,400
What?

582
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,480
She comes from a rural family

583
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:12,159
No way

584
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:14,880
All here

585
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,159
Come

586
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:18,599
So pretty

587
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,159
Yuwei's dad is here too

588
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,239

589
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,119

00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:28,119

Let me tell you

598
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,700
Wang Changhai's wife is my classmate

599
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:41,760
We often have a party together

600
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,760
You can come if you have the time

601
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:44,800
Ok

602
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,039
Linda's mom

603
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,875
What do you think of my party?

604
00:43:49,239 --> 00:43:50,400
Awesome  -Really?

605
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:50,960

Look at those kids

607
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:53,719
They are so happy

608
00:43:53,719 --> 00:43:55,079
Yes, they all like it very much

609
00:43:55,079 --> 00:43:55,960
Yes...  -Great

610
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:59,400
Well, let me introduce you some friends

611
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,880
Some French designers are here

612
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:03,639
They can design some nice clothes for you  -Really?

613
00:44:03,639 --> 00:44:04,159
