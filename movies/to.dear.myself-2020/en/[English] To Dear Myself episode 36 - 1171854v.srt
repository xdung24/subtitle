[Episode 36]

4
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:46,520
Did CEO Li get funding or not?

5
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,670
I saw her worried look. I don't think she did.

6
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,850
Hey.

7
00:01:55,260 --> 00:02:00,070
I heard that she's planning on selling the company.

8
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,620
Hey.

9
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:04,760
What are you doing? Not working and spreading gossip?

10
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:09,900
Guan Xiaotang, you're the man pursuing Director Li. Did you get any information?

11
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:14,220
My information is that our company is fine.

12
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:30,340
- We got paid! 
 - I think even more than last month.

13
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,140
It's three times more than last month!

14
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,310
Now you guys aren't worried, right?

15
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:39,070
If Sister Li says she can get funding, she can get funding.

16
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,840
Everyone come here!

17
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:53,320
There must be good news.

18
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,750
Everyone's here, right?

19
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,770
Pretty much.

20
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:03,270
I gave everyone three months of salary. I believe it arrived today, right?

21
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:05,710
Yes!  Thank you, CEO Li!

22
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:08,420
Hopefully, every month will be three times our salary!

23
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:16,450
Are you asking for working overtime?

24
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:22,280
I'm announcing...

25
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:28,590
Laidianle from today on will be closed.

26
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:32,110
- No way. 
 - How is that possible?

27
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:37,100
I don't get it. I don't understand.

28
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:41,060
When you first joined the company,

29
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:46,580
I promised you that I would make the company grow until we IPO.

30
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:53,980
But the reality is, I don't have that ability and can't keep that promise.

31
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:05,310
The company is like this because of me. I let you all down.

32
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,440
Sorry.

33
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,610
CEO LI, we can't close the company.

34
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:20,780
Yes, CEO Li.

35
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:26,380
- How about we all think of a way together? 
 - Isn't it just an issue with money?

36
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,690
I have money.

37
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:31,210
Guan Xiaotang, stop it!

38
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:36,630
I'm serious. Sister CEO Li, how much do we need? I can help resolve it.

39
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:40,800
Thank you, everyone. I know how you feel.

40
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:46,700
But Laidianle is congenitally deficient indeed.

41
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:49,590
We don't need to continue.

42
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:54,300
- But Director Li, we can— 
 - Don't say anything more. I have already made the decision for you.

43
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:00,020
We all have a far journey to go. I wish our paths will cross again.

44
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:05,610
CEO LI!

45
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:08,500
What?

46
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:25,600
 5, 4, 3, 2, 1!

47
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,030
Yay!

48
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:33,240
 Let's toast to the future!

49
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,160
 We will win!

50
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,060
We will be able to smile till the end!

51
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:41,920
All of the doubts have become miracles,

52
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,030
and the person who created these miracles

53
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:49,160
is me. Li Siyu.

54
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,780
Sister!

55
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:06,030
Here's the money for the office furniture.

56
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,670
You should keep it.

57
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,570
I don't need it.

58
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:13,530
I know you covered the expense before.

59
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:17,680
How did you know that?

60
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:29,300
Sister, don't worry. You still have me even though the company's closed.

61
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:32,540
What am I going to do with you?

62
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:37,230
A boyfriend! I would also be willing to be your husband.

63
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,020
See! I can make you laugh, right?

64
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:45,560
As much as I'm useless, I can still make you laugh. Right?

65
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,790
- Guan Xiaotang. 
 -  I am here.

66
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:53,710
Thank you.

67
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:04,070
Older Sister, if you need another website, I'll make you a bigger, better, more professional one for you!

68
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:20,500
This Director Gong is very skilled. Later, you have to introduce the business properly to him.

69
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,600
Do I need you to say that?

70
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,770
Lei Haowen!

71
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:24,950
- Hi, Director Gong. 
 - Hello.

72
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:27,350
This is my partner, Chen Yiming.

73
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:31,780
- Hello, Director Gong. 
 - Let's talk inside. 
 - Come on in.

74
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:56,790
This is your company?

75
00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:00,700
Yes. Yiming is in charge of content primarily, and I handle business operations.

76
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,330
Correct.

77
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,540
This is what you want me to invest in?

78
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,220
Exactly.

79
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,160
You've got to be joking?

80
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,600
We are willing to spend ¥1,000

81
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,410
to rent a table in a cafe to start a business.

82
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:22,790
And when you first started your business, you couldn't even rent a table and had to work out of your single dorm.

83
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:27,770
You know me?

84
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:33,640
So handsome!

85
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:39,580
My company's philosophy is based on social media to provide virtual planning for financial institutions.

86
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:45,790
While breaking a traditional company's framework at the same time as we are breaking a traditional company's form.  Why don't we do that?

87
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,060
Continue talking.

88
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:50,400
Don't look down at this cafe.

89
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,290
The CEO of Xiaomai Company, which just launched,

90
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:56,890
at that corner, he wrote down his first line of code.

91
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:02,110
Last month, the man who entered the list of wealthiest men, Qin Geng, on this table,

92
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:04,170
wrote his first proposal.

93
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:05,410
And...

94
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:13,440
the Dufeng company which is called Community  Unicorn, also got its first investment in the cafe.

95
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,170
So, Director Gong, maybe the next great business tale

96
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:24,640
might happen right on this table, between the two of us.

97
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,490
Then... let's talk about shares.

98
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,920
Director Gong.

99
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,630
What do you want to drink?

100
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:43,610
Come take a look here.

101
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:53,260
- Sister Siyu, you're really going to leave? 
 - You think I'm bluffing?

102
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:58,620
- There are no issues, right? 
 - No, just missing home.

103
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,270
Older Sister.

104
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:20,880
Are you still unhappy? Let me tell you...

105
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,760
If you're unhappy, drink beer. I found a really good brand.

106
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,700
- Everyone, greet Older Sister! 
 - Hi!

107
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:32,930
See, Older Sister? These are all things that you never could've imagined, but nothing that you can't do! You can eat, drink, 

108
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:34,990
and play video games!

109
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:37,020
Who is that?

110
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:46,760
Older Sister, really. You cannot use your heart only to think about work.

111
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:51,430
You also need to take care of your mood. If you want to play video games, then play them.

112
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:55,120
This home party place is very suitable for you who was born between 1985-1990.

113
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,970
I'll send you the address soon. Come later.

114
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:02,400
Guan Xiaotang?

115
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:09,360
What do you mean, "missing home," you're just trying to escape.

116
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:15,280
I can even accept that "I'm a loser." What else do I need to escape from?

117
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:19,970
If you could face it, then when Guan Xiaotang calls you, why do you shut your phone off?

118
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,990
If you could face it, then stay here.

119
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:27,130
If you want to be with a younger man, then be with him. If you want to earn money, then go get it.

120
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:30,350
- Xiaoling! 
 - Am I wrong?

121
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,590
I guess you are right.

122
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,720
Li Siyu,

123
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:42,520
in the past, when I saw you so helpless, I always felt so annoyed.

124
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:46,300
Now that you're like this, I feel even more pain in my heart.

125
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:53,450
I'm begging you, will you go back to your high-and-mighty personality?

126
00:11:55,420 --> 00:12:03,760
The Li Siyu before was arrogant and eager for quick success.

127
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:11,220
In the end, I brought down GM Pan with me, disappointed all of the employees, and even harmed myself.

128
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:15,860
That was just a one time, unlucky failure.

129
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:22,150
This failure made me figure out myself.

130
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:30,520
In the past, I thought that I was so capable, better than anyone.

131
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,930
I could win any battle.

132
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:39,700
Now... I understand.

133
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:44,550
I am just a normal person.

134
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:49,200
I'm an ordinary normal person.

135
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,770
No. Sister Siyu,

136
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:59,880
in my heart, you have always been formidable. You have always been my idol.

137
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:12,150
Zhizhi, in the past, it was because I was lucky.

138
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:19,450
Now, all of my good luck has ended.

139
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,760
Ten thousand.

140
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,360
- Four cakes. 
 - Want it?

141
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,400
- I won. 
 - You missed one piece! 
 - I have this!

142
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,770
- Hey! You're missing a piece! 
 - Missing what piece?

143
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:33,490
- Why don't you count? 
 - You are missing a tile. This win doesn't count.

144
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:36,990
- I just put it here. 
 - It's yours?

145
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:38,990
Then... Then this one is mine.

146
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:41,000
I just put it here.

147
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,490
You are cheating.

148
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:44,650
You need to treat us if you cheated.

149
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,120
What do you mean, treat you? Didn't I do that a few days ago?

150
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,810
- Dad! 
 - You didn't treat the two of us.

151
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:51,370
My princess came back.

152
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:54,310
Hey, I'm not playing today. Not playing. Sorry.

153
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:57,340
You play with them!

154
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:00,950
Don't forget the treats tonight.

155
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:06,660
My guest, are you staying or eating?

156
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:10,230
- I'm coming home. 
 - Then you are in the right place.

157
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:11,730
Dad,

158
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:15,720
why are you still so naughty?

159
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:20,720
- Your leg. Did the old problem act up again? 
 - It's fine.

160
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:25,210
- Let's go, hurry home. 
 - Slow down, don't rush.

161
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:27,510
It's fine.

162
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:34,050
Come, come, come. Come in.

163
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,660
Siyu is back!

164
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,860
That fast?

165
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:47,490
Xiaoling called me just now. I assumed there would be another thirty minutes.

166
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:51,820
- Auntie. 
 - You must be hungry, right? I have two more dishes that are about to be ready.

167
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,380
Quickly, pour a glass of water for her.

168
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,660
I know, I know.

169
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:58,860
- Thank you! Go rest. 
 - Put your things down first.

170
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:23,750
- Dad. 
 - Here, drink some water first.

171
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,010
Sit down.

172
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:30,610
It's time to eat!

173
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:33,810
- There's more food? 
 - Let's eat.

174
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:39,780
We haven't eaten with you in around 200 days, of course we need to make it more luxurious.

175
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:44,030
Siyu, eat some more. Here. Eat some more.

176
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:46,590
- Thank you, Auntie. 
 - Here you go.

177
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:49,010
Auntie, that's enough, that's enough. I won't be able to finish it.

178
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:53,640
Look at you. Look how skinny you are? Eat some more.

179
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:57,730
- Thank you. 
 - I heard Xiaoling say that you resigned from your company.

180
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:01,060
Why?

181
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,880
I was too tired.

182
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,530
Then rest well this time.

183
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:09,700
- Okay.  
 - Are you still going to leave?

184
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,620
No.

185
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:14,190
That's wonderful.

186
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:17,760
The news said that the young people of the first tier city

187
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:23,460
work on a tight schedule, all work super hard. Right?

188
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,420
Every day, they only do three things.

189
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:29,870
They work, eat, and sleep. How could you call this living? It's just existing.

190
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:33,770
Yes. It's best.  You should have also brought Xiaoling back.

191
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:35,420
I wouldn't be able to make Xiaoling budge.

192
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:39,790
What's going on with her? It's been many months since she's contacted us.

193
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:44,960
When she finally called, and I asked her one too many questions, she got impatient with me!

194
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,740
- She's doing well. 
 - How has she been solving her personal problems?

195
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:52,470
She has a boyfriend with great conditions in every domain.

196
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,940
Do the two of them have a chance of being together for life?

197
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,410
It should be no problem.

198
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:08,460
What a big event... She didn't even tell me.

199
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,100
Does she still see me as her mother?

200
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,050
It's not that Xiaoling wasn't planning on telling you.

201
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:20,690
Of course, she sees you as her mother! It's just that she didn't think it was time to tell you yet. She will, she will.

202
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,770
You don't even have an office.

203
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:35,520
Not even a successful case, and got two million in investment.

204
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,360
Yes.

205
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,690
What kind of person is this investor?

206
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:43,130
What do you mean what kind of person is the investor? He's just an investor.

207
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:48,320
He also has his own business. It's not big, but the projects that he launched all have a high success rate.

208
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,770
Really? Wow.

209
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:54,630
So that means that he's not a lunatic.

210
00:18:54,630 --> 00:19:00,400
Of course, he isn't. Not only is he not a lunatic, but he's also very smart. He's also pretty handsome as well.

211
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,130
- Really? 
 - Yes.

212
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:05,550
Then there's only one possible way to explain this.

213
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:08,310
Your creativity is very good.

214
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:14,230
Maybe he likes Le Haowen's looks and my abs. We are like a piece of abs.

215
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:16,850
- Yiming. 
 - Yes?

216
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:19,640
In the beginning, you were adamant that I was not allowed to invest in your company.

217
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,640
You don't even want me to have a look at your business plan.

218
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,990
I think you made me miss a wonderful opportunity.

219
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:33,020
You already invested in me though. When everyone else didn't believe in me, when even I felt suspicious of myself, it was you who gave me confidence.

220
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,620
Look at that.

221
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,660
How is this one?

222
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,630
I don't want it.

223
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,230
I didn't say it was for you.

224
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,600
I'll wear it.

225
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,190
You will wear it? This is for men.

226
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:06,660
You didn't realize that I liked wearing male suits?

227
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:25,890
Older Sister, why won't you respond to my WeChat messages?

228
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:28,200
Older Sister...

229
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,970
I miss you.

230
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:34,090
Older Sister? Where are you?

231
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:40,230
Older Sister, if you don't respond immediately, I'm calling the police!

232
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:16,330
Lao Li, did you see the girl by the river?

233
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:19,440
She's walking around. Will she commit suicide?

234
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,830
That's my daughter.

235
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:24,190
Your daughter?

236
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:27,870
Which daughter?

237
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:29,940
The one who resemble me the least.

238
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:37,710
The one who has company and is good at making money in Shanghai?

239
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:40,580
The one with the most suffering life.

240
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:46,330
She doesn't look like it.

241
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:10,590
Hi!

242
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:13,000
- Hi! 
 - Hi. You came back?

243
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,340
Yes, I came back.

244
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:18,130
Siyu, this is Uncle He.

245
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:21,000
- Hi, Uncle He. 
 - Hello!

246
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,030
I heard that you were doing well in Shanghai. We all know this!

247
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,110
Thank you.

248
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:29,890
It's okay. Sit.

249
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:40,380
Dad,

250
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:44,970
I came back after I lost everything.

251
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:51,730
I also lost all my money yesterday.

252
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:58,290
I broke up with Chen Yiming.

253
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:05,140
Was it his fault or your fault?

254
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:10,750
It's not someone's fault. We broke up peacefully.

255
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:13,900
Then find another one.

256
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:19,040
Don't pull a long face. It's not a big thing.

257
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:24,830
I'm already in my 30s. I have achieved nothing.

258
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:29,850
I have achieved nothing for my whole life.

259
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:34,020
But I lead a more comfortable life than anyone else.

260
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:43,870
You take things too seriously. It's not necessary.

261
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:47,280
Be careful.

262
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:52,070
Don't die early like your mom.

263
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:53,870
Dad!

264
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:00,560
It's gone.

265
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,430
I can go back with nothing at the worst.

266
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:07,160
Then you came here in vain.

267
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:12,350
Fishing is just for fun. The result is not so important.

268
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:14,980
It's like our life.

269
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:20,450
As long as we are happy, having achievement or not is both okay.

270
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:39,980
How old is your child?

271
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:42,480
I don't have a child.

272
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,620
Your husband's family didn't ask you?

273
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:47,630
I haven't gotten married.

274
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:50,970
How about your boyfriend? Didn't he come back with you?

275
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:55,090
- What does he do? 
 - I don't have a boyfriend either.

276
00:25:55,090 --> 00:26:01,660
- Do you have any conditions? I can introduce some to you. 
 - Let's talk about it in the future. I need to find work first.

277
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:04,120
How is it going?

278
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:07,570
My dad's workplace is recruiting. I will go and give it a try.

279
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:11,150
I know,  the company just under the Housing Construction Bureau.

280
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:15,390
My cousin works there. He will take care of you. No problem.

281
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:21,370
No need to bother your cousin. My dad's student is in HR now. He says that I'm qualified.

282
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:25,450
You will need this. Everyone needs a strong connection in that unit.

283
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:31,000
You need to let people know you have it too or else people will bully you at work.

284
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:36,450
- Thank you. 
 - Siyu,

285
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:39,850
for your age now,

286
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:43,350
I'm afraid that you can only find divorced people. Are you okay with it?

287
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:48,930
Excuse me, I want to go to the restroom.

288
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:51,120
- Okay. Go. 
 - Thank you.

289
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:57,540
Who? You know him. It's him!

290
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:35,330
[U-likeMart]

291
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:50,290
Hi!

292
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,700
May I know who are you?

293
00:27:55,700 --> 00:28:00,470
Li Siyu, we used to share a desk.

294
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:01,870
Did we?

295
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:03,970
The second semester of the 1st year in middle school.

296
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:08,080
Yes.

297
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,430
We haven't met each other for over 10 years.

298
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:12,090
That long?

299
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:15,270
We haven't met since we graduated from high school.

300
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:17,990
Actually, I come back every year for the spring festival.

301
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:22,010
I take my parents out to travel during the spring festival every year.

302
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:23,540
Then we missed each other perfectly.

303
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:26,540
Perfectly?

304
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:30,270
Nothing.

305
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:34,760
I heard that you wouldn't leave this time.

306
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:38,520
Yes. I'm looking for a job now.

307
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,700
Then we can meet each other often.

308
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:45,810
All right. Tell me when there are classmate gatherings.

309
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:47,360
Okay.

310
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:52,930
This juice is healthy. Give it a try.

311
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:55,180
Thank you.

312
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:05,410
I was passing by and bought some breakfast.

313
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,270
Eat while it's still hot.

314
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:11,730
I sent the salary to you.

315
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:29,910
- Hi. 
 - Thank you. 
 - You are welcome.

316
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:51,260
You paid me another ¥5,000?

317
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,690
What do you mean?

318
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:59,900
Boss, you want to keep me as a mistress? It's not enough.

319
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:04,210
What do you mean, Boss? Don't I need to pay ¥300,000 back to you?

320
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:07,680
Return! You must return!

321
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:10,860
But I have to pay the mortgage now.

322
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:16,250
So the money I owe you, I can only pay you back little by little.

323
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:22,320
Yiming,

324
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:27,680
actually, the ¥300,000 was not from me.

325
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,960
From who then?

326
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:33,970
Li Siyu.

327
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:41,830
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

328
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:45,910
Li Siyu didn't want me to tell you.

329
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:52,060
She left.

330
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:56,090
Where did she go?

331
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:00,250
To her hometown.

332
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:03,100
Why?

333
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:06,670
You ask her by yourself if you want to know.

334
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:20,060
Impossible! It's not her personality to go back.

335
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:26,330
She has suffered too much, so her personality has changed?

336
00:31:56,490 --> 00:32:00,750
- Oh my, it's over ¥100 . 
 - What size? 
 - S.

337
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:05,780
I think it fits you well.

338
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:13,280
Everyone, stop work for a moment. Get to know our new colleague.

339
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,500
Hi, everyone. I'm Li Siyu.

340
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,590
Li Siyu?

341
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:23,100
I'm Liu Junning. We were on the same team of our high school's military training. But later we were divided into different classes.

342
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:26,320
It's you!

343
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:32,360
Since you were classmates, then you can show Li Siyu to get familiar with our working environment.

344
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,500
Sure.

345
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:40,000
Who can make our work plan tomorrow?

346
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:42,680
Are you still living over in Shanghai?

347
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,480
Nana?

348
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:48,750
I haven't finished the work you gave to me last time.

349
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:51,560
Liu Junning,

350
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:58,560
my mother-in-law and my son are both sick. I have lots to deal with in my family.

351
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,280
Lao Zhai?

352
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:05,230
I'm still writing this year's summary.

353
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:11,550
Where is Lao Zhang?

354
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:13,120
Lao Zhang asked for leave.

355
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:17,360
Again?

356
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:25,220
The food delivery has arrived. Who can go get it?

357
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:33,110
Let me do it.

358
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:42,290
- Food! 
 - Put the here! Here!

359
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:44,610
The food has arrived!

360
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:51,860
Go.

361
00:33:55,660 --> 00:34:00,380
You shouldn't have taken it. Did you eat breakfast? We can share one.

362
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:02,000
What's wrong?

363
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,030
Nothing. Taking delivery is your job from now on.

364
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:13,670
I started to contact CC Fund.

365
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:16,240
Okay. Good.

366
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:19,720
How much can we make from your expectations?

367
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:22,700
Four to five billion.

368
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:30,460
Within one year, from 800 million to 4 billion. Nice!

369
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:33,900
President Wang is not of the common sort as expected.

370
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:38,450
Only this amount of income won't waste our efforts.

371
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:41,250
Let's look forward to the good news from President Wang.

372
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:43,120
- Yes. 
 - No problem.

373
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,560
- Okay. We'll get going. 
 - Okay.

374
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,440
I will inform you both if there is any update.

375
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,830
Okay. We are going.

376
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:54,360
- See you, President Wang. 
 - I will walk you out.

377
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:58,080
- No need to walk us, President Wang. 
 - It's okay.

378
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,670
Stay there, President Wang.

379
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:04,070
Safe journey.

380
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:25,430
President Wang, Director Gong has been waiting for you for a long time.

381
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:27,830
Let him in.

382
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:03,280
- President Wang. 
 - Here. Director Gong, take a seat.

383
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:12,160
Tell me what your evaluation of Chen Yiming was.

384
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:17,290
He has creativity and determination to work.

385
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:20,330
Does the virtual planning platform he's working on have value?

386
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:23,500
If he can do it well, then there is a lot of potential.

387
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:27,180
Of course, everything relies on the market.

388
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,800
He didn't suspect you?

389
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:35,030
I was introduced by Lei Haowen's friend, so he didn't suspect anything.

390
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:42,400
Great. Then just be a good investor.

391
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,920
Okay.

392
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:02,510
Mom! Mom!

393
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:06,880
- What's wrong, Yuwei? 
 - Mom!

394
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:19,340
Don't be afraid! Don't be afraid! Mom is here.

395
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:23,160
Don't be afraid! Don't be afraid. I am here.

396
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:27,730
Mom! I want Mom!

397
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:31,330
Don't be afraid, Mom is here. It's just rain and thunder.

398
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:33,800
Mom, I'm so scared.

399
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,530
Don't be afraid.

400
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,760
[He Mu]

401
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:49,840
Hello, the phone you are calling is powered off.

402
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:53,660
Hello, the phone you are calling is powered off.

403
00:38:56,190 --> 00:39:01,210
I will tell you a story, okay?

404
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:07,230
A long time ago, in a forest,

405
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:10,060
there was a female duck that was laying her eggs.

406
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:14,190
Not the Little Mermaid?

407
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:17,380
I'll tell you the story of the ugly duckling, okay?

408
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:19,230
Okay.

409
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:28,010
The little ducks got out of the eggshell one after another.

410
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:34,680
There was one duck that was different from all of the others.

411
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:38,850
It was both big and ugly.

412
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:03,790
Hey, Xiaoling? What's wrong? Missing me?

413
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:07,920
Why would I miss you? Come save me!

414
00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:43,010
Sweep carefully.

415
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,760
Lei Haowen.

416
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:52,250
You're back? How did you sleep in the hotel? Was it good?

417
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:54,050
You didn't sleep all night?

418
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:59,160
At daybreak, I planned to doze off for a bit.

419
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:03,960
However, there was a sudden situation.

420
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:08,210
Sir, look, look!

421
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:10,920
You need to sweep all of the glass carefully!

422
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:14,380
- Keep sweeping. Look again. 
 - Okay.

423
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:19,740
- Be more precise. 
 - Okay.

424
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:23,950
That rat ran out.

425
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:28,130
It was rebelling against me, so I had to play the role of Tom.

426
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:31,760
Destroy his power and prestige!

427
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:36,560
You need to quickly eat this medicine. You were in the rain all night.

428
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:41,160
If you get sick, you'll blame me for not saving you quickly enough.

429
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:44,350
- Make it by yourself. 
 - Mr. Lei, give me a hand.

430
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:48,250
- These two pieces? 
 - Yes, hold them steady.

431
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:55,780
So did you catch it?

432
00:42:55,780 --> 00:43:01,280
I caught them! Don't worry, I released them.

433
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:04,430
Make it secure.

434
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:06,010
Okay.

 Timing & Subtitles by My Dear Myself Team @Viki.com 

436
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:17,060
Why are you looking at me? Eat your medicine.

437
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:19,790
Xiaoling,

438
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:25,240
the way you're looking at me today is a bit flirty.

439
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,720
Go to hell!

440
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:30,520
You have to eat your medicine.

441
00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:34,390
Right. Stick it firmly.
