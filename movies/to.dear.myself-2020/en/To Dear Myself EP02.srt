00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:30,975
[To Dear Myself]

2
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:34,175
[Ep2]

3
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,000
Sister Yuan

4
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,400
Siyu

5
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:00,640
Thank you for yesterday

6
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,560
It's ok

7
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,159
It's ok for this quarter, right?

8
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:05,480
Still not enough

9
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:06,359
Why?

10
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:07,840
Not everyone is like you

11
00:02:10,158 --> 00:02:13,625
Let me think, if I can win more orders

12
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,000
Forget it

13
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,520
You have worked for two weeks

14
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,479
Whatever

15
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:18,439
No way

16
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:20,759
Here comes the moment whether you will be the director

17
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:21,960
We can't give up

18
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,680
What's wrong?

19
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,840
My stomach aches recently

20
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,919
Come to my office

21
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,775
Ok, after I leave my bag in my office

22
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,599
Morning, sister Siyu 

23
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,280
Morning, sister Siyu 

24
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:38,879
Morning

25
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:39,479
Morning, sister Siyu 

26
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,000
Morning

27
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:53,879
Here

28
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,000
I haven't finished those you gave me last time

29
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:59,039
Keep it just in case

30
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:00,000
You should pay attention to your stomach

31
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,319
Thank you

32
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:02,680
Get an invoice

33
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,840
I will get an extra 500 yuan of invoice

34
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:05,800
It's the reward of your overtime work

35
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,879
I should claim overtime pay

36
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,360
500 yuan for the normal procedure?

37
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,520
Ok

38
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,560
I will tell president Fang

39
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,400
Just need a signature

40
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:15,400
Go

41
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:18,560
It's ok, bye

42
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:27,960
Sister Siyu

43
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:32,879
Did brother Yiming make the proposal to you?

44
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,319
He wanted to

45
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:37,840
But I stopped him

46
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,240
Why?

47
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,719
I do not know either

48
00:03:44,425 --> 00:03:46,000
You have other plans?

49
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:48,000
No

50
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,120
Chen Yiming is the only one I want to marry in my life

51
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,800
Why are you hesitating?

52
00:03:53,225 --> 00:03:55,360
You have been dating for five years

53
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:56,680
Four years and five months

54
00:03:58,439 --> 00:03:59,639
You should get married

55
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,468
Liu Yang and I get married after we know each other for half a year

56
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:05,120
Zhizhi

57
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:09,125
Do you miss being single before you marry Liu Yang

58
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:10,919
No

59
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,525
I was impatient to marry him

60
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:17,680
But I...

61
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,720
I am happy when I am with him

62
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:27,675
But when I think of being his wife and a mom after marriage

63
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,120
I feel flurried

64
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:33,199
Do you think too much?

65
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,199
Perhaps

66
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:36,680
Siyu

67
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,600
You are here

68
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:39,639
You want to see me?

69
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,600
President Pan wants to see you

70
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,519
Go to his office

71
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:51,839
Come... Gather here

72
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,759
What happened?

73
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:55,120
As I know, their department laid off some staff

74
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,959
Again?

75
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:58,000
So will next time be our turn?

76
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,240
Likely

77
00:04:59,240 --> 00:04:59,879
Yes

78
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:01,079
If it goes on like this, we...

79
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,879
What are you playing at?

80
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,839
Boss

81
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,639
Administration department laid off another three today

82
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,560
Do not worry

83
00:05:10,825 --> 00:05:12,560
It won't happen to us

84
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:13,560
Boss

85
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:15,240
Strategy department laid off two, too

86
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:15,879
Yes

87
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,079
Their departments are overstaffed

88
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:20,040
Of course, they will lay off some staff

89
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,174
Our planning department is understaffed

90
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,480
What are you afraid of?

91
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,160
Yeah

92
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,399
Back to work

93
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:26,800
I need Mid-autumn festival plan

94
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,120
the quote of We-Media

95
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,025
and the responses from the advertising company now

96
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:32,040
Come...

97
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,680
Thank you

98
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,560
What?

99
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,480
After we left yesterday

100
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,319
did you make the proposal?

101
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,680
No

102
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:49,600
It's a late night

103
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,319
It's so romantic and so suitable for marriage proposal

104
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:53,839
Yeah

105
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,199
Then why don't you take action?

106
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,920
Maybe not ready

107
00:05:57,175 --> 00:05:59,600
It's you or her?

108
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,040
Neither of us

109
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,680
Girls need the sense of security, perhaps

110
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,160
She lacks sense of security?

111
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,759
Yeah

112
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:16,025
You are a young and handsome talent

113
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,000
You will be a good option for husband

114
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,075
If I were a girl, I would like to marry you

115
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,480
Stop it

116
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,199
You are not here to ask me if I make the proposal, right?

117
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:27,480
Of course not

118
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,040
Say it

119
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,600
Help me make an appointment with Gu Xiaoling

120
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:32,639
What are you doing?

121
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,519
You have Gu Xiaoling's WeChat, right?

122
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:36,879
She blacklisted me

123
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
So fast

124
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,000
I need your help

125
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,839
Sorry I can't

126
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,199
Why?

127
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:47,480
She blacklisted you

128
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,759
It means she has no interest in you

129
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:50,680
I have a strong interest in her

130
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,285
Gu Xiaoling's desire has a large property

131
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:59,120
Maybe she can find the precious true love from me

132
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:01,480
Wake up

133
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:06,040
Or, her back-up

134
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,199
You are not qualified

135
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:08,959
A just-in-case?

136
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,879
Why are you such an asshole?

137
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:14,450
That's the way I am

138
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:20,079
Now all of them are worried of being fired

139
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:21,600
Why are you still thinking about this?

140
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,240
What am I afraid of?

141
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:24,279
I am a rich son

142
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,439
When do you become a rich son?

143
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:28,040
My father's name has a rich

144
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,199
What happened?

145
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,975
Come to HR department

146
00:07:35,575 --> 00:07:37,199
I need to go to HR now

147
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:39,959
Make an appointment for me

148
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,759
Piss off

149
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:41,399
Help me

150
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,480
I have something to tell you 

151
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:56,475
Xingdian shut down yesterday

152
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:59,399
Why?

153
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:01,600
Insufficient orders, and financial crisis

154
00:08:05,975 --> 00:08:08,600
Our sales have been declining

155
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:12,725
If it goes on like this, it's our turn to shut down

156
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:27,500
So what's the problem of the sales department?

157
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:31,519
Maybe...

158
00:08:33,674 --> 00:08:36,798
We haven't mobilized their enthusiasm

159
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,325
How to mobilize their enthusiasm?

160
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:45,320
President Pan

161
00:08:46,675 --> 00:08:49,360
I need to think it over before I answer you

162
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,679
I have already thought about it

163
00:08:53,925 --> 00:08:56,600
I will split sales department into two

164
00:08:57,399 --> 00:08:59,960
You and Yuan Huizhong will lead a team separately

165
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:00,960
Three months later

166
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,679
Which team has a better sales performance

167
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:04,480
Remember, sales performance 

168
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:06,519
The team leader will be the director of sales department

169
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,759
I?

170
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:09,480
You...

171
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,399
Team leader?

172
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:12,679
Not just the leader

173
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:17,250
I hope you will become the director

174
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,600
Compete with sister Yuan?

175
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,759
Is that ok?

176
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,000
What's wrong with it?

177
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,679
I have worked here for seven years

178
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,080
Sister Yuan has worked here for more than ten years

179
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:37,840
Our company won't care about the seniority

180
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:39,200
But...

181
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,039
I know

182
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,480
You are good friends

183
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,000
But remember

184
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:49,025
If companies has good relationship regardless of competition

185
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,799
all of us will be screwed sooner or later

186
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:56,679
Does sister Yuan know this?

187
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:58,519
She will accept

188
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:05,679
Li Siyu

189
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,900
Why do you work here?

190
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,559
Just for a job?

191
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:16,080
Or you want a platform to prove yourself?

192
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,919
Now this is the platform for you

193
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:20,879
The rest is up to you

194
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,080
President Pan

195
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,720
I need to think about it

196
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:38,519
Siyu

197
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,720
President Fang

198
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,440
President Pan is in there, right?

199
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:40,960
Yes

200
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,440
Ok

201
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:48,799
Our department has only 8 people

202
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:49,600
You want to lay off them?

203
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:51,600
This is the decision of the board

204
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:54,450
Every department of the company needs to be cut off by a half

205
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:57,825
The one-size-fits-all approach is so irrational

206
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,080
But it works

207
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:00,360
Yes

208
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,559
You should downsize overstaffed departments

209
00:11:02,825 --> 00:11:06,600
But my department is understaffed

210
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:10,825
If we don't downsize, our company will collapse

211
00:11:13,775 --> 00:11:17,800
Well, give me the list before you get off work today

212
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,000
No

213
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,679
Manager Chen

214
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:28,075
I hired them in

215
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:30,200
They have worked with me for so many years

216
00:11:30,925 --> 00:11:33,480
They are underpaid

217
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:37,559
I feel so sorry for them

218
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:39,240
Now you want me to fire them

219
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:40,320
No way

220
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,519
I can't do this

221
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:43,360
Don't be emotional

222
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,320
We are human beings with emotions

223
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,000
But companies only care about benefits

224
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,639
Ok

225
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,237
If you insist, I will resign

226
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:04,360
I can give you the resignation letter this afternoon

227
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,120
You can give me now

228
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,639
Ziting, where's sister Yuan?

229
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:36,440
She went to see the client

230
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:03,120
So much?

231
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,559
A robbery

232
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,519
How can I get so much money?

233
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:09,679
No insurance?

234
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:14,401
I asked them, Lanke's car has no car insurance

235
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:17,720
Asshole

236
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:22,120
Don't tell Yiming about this

237
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,080
Why?

238
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,759
It's my own business

239
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:27,000
It has nothing to do with him

240
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,519
He made the proposal, right?

241
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,679
Why?

242
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:40,550
Your roadshow last month wins our department's praise

243
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:43,440
And last year

244
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:46,080
The company was in trouble

245
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:47,559
They forgot?

246
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:49,120
Who turned the table?

247
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,825
Who should take the credit for Caijin Company's success?

248
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,600
It's you

249
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:55,679
Enough

250
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:01,840
It's so unfair

251
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,159
You are the biggest hero in the company

252
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,200
They can't fire you

253
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:11,039
The company is short of money now

254
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:14,279
They want to downsize the department that spends money most

255
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,840
He wanted to fire the whole planning department

256
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:20,480
Now they got what they desired

257
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:23,080
You are so honest

258
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:24,919
They have routined you

259
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:28,519
Yeah, it's a routine

260
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:29,320
What can I do?

261
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,440
I think it's pretty good

262
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,080
I feel so relieved now

263
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:37,320
Really want to go?

264
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:45,175
Headhunting companies extended the olive branch many times

265
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,799
They let me to name the wage and treatment 

266
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,639
But I think I can't abandon the company

267
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:50,480
Then I rejected them all

268
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,000
It's great now

269
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,039
Now I am free

270
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:56,440
Free

271
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:04,960
Don't tell Li Siyu about this

272
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,759
Why?

273
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,519
It's no use telling her

274
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:13,400
I will tell her after I have a new job

275
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:16,879
I felt guilty for destroying Chen Yiming's

276
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:18,200
 proposal for a whole night

277
00:15:19,325 --> 00:15:21,600
Actually you don't want to marry him at all

278
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,159
I helped you out

279
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,360
But you even rebuke me

280
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,919
It's ok that you don't feel grateful

281
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:29,225
Where is your conscience?

282
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,279
It's two different matters

283
00:15:31,925 --> 00:15:33,759
I didn't set you a trap with Lanke

284
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,600
Anyway, you owe me a favor

285
00:15:36,075 --> 00:15:38,559
Without me, you are a married woman now

286
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,960
Don't say that

287
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:42,799
I am scared to hear that

288
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,120
What's wrong with married women?

289
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,480
Zhizhi

290
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:52,360
No offense

291
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,559
Sister Siyu

292
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,700
I think you can't hesitate anymore 

293
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,700
if brother Yiming make proposal again

294
00:16:01,715 --> 00:16:02,840
Just marry him

295
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,840
I agree

296
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,639
Chen Yiming is ordinary

297
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:06,960
But he is way enough for you

298
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:12,119
I think you can't delay the marriage

299
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:16,200
Some people have dated for eight years

300
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,679
In the end they break up with each other

301
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,440
Don't talk about this

302
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,480
Let's talk about the compensation

303
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:25,600
What's your next plan?

304
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,840
I am so exhausted after the previous road show

305
00:16:30,775 --> 00:16:32,759
I need to have a good rest

306
00:16:33,475 --> 00:16:35,480
And I need to look for the proper opportunity

307
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,159
You didn't have lunch right?

308
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,399
Yeah

309
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:41,200
Here

310
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,279
Eat

311
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:45,919
Bye

312
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:48,240
Where are you going?

313
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:50,279
Enjoy a good life

314
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,960
Your stuff

315
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:54,120
Keep it for me

316
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,799
It's a large compensation

317
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:05,000
We have to compensate no matter what

318
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,079
We signed a mediation agreement

319
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,640
It's all here

320
00:17:11,224 --> 00:17:13,358
18,000 in total

321
00:17:15,358 --> 00:17:17,199
Your bag is very valuable, right?

322
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,839
So I have no money now

323
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:20,754
Sister Siyu

324
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,400
Liu Yang and I have 20,000 yuan in deposit

325
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,640
But it goes to financial management

326
00:17:27,925 --> 00:17:29,880
I don't know if I can take it out now

327
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,079
Where are you going?

328
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,640
Buy lottery ticket

329
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,559
Where are you going?

330
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:43,880
Try a fortune 

331
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,799
Your name is Liu Yang

332
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,960
Top students of Chiao Tung University

333
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:51,799
Yes

334
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:54,200
Mr. Lu, you have a good memory

335
00:17:54,759 --> 00:17:57,650
I have no other advantages but love talents

336
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,119
Liu

337
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:02,034
I hope you can complete the tender successfully

338
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,160
Yes...

339
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,440
President Lu, don't worry

340
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,240
We won't fail you

341
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,279
Ok

342
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,160
Work hard

343
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:09,880
Yes

344
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:10,880
Go back

345
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,920
Ok, bye

346
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,279
Thank you

347
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:14,920
You are welcome

348
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:15,880
Good bye, president Lu

349
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,039
Director Wang, it's windy outside

350
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:26,839
You should go in

351
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,400
Liu Yang

352
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,400
Great

353
00:18:31,525 --> 00:18:35,729
I will tell the financial department to give you the bonus 

354
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,960
You should hurry up

355
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:42,725
Write what you need in the report

356
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:43,839
I will approve of it 

357
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,759
Ok, director

358
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:45,799
I will send you back

359
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:47,279
No need. Back to work

360
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:48,279
Ok, director

361
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:48,799
Ok

362
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,240
Liu Yang, don't forget

363
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,759
Today we will pick up Yuwei together

364
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,160
Wait a second

365
00:19:00,759 --> 00:19:01,559
Liu Yang

366
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,233
Brother, so unbelievble, you would play alumni card

367
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:09,920
President Lu is from Chiao Tung University, too?

368
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:11,640
Don't pretend it

369
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,960
I really do not know

370
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:15,079
Great

371
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:16,440
Bonus of 50,000 yuan

372
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:17,880
And the leader of the tender team

373
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:20,039
What a promotion

374
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,279
I just proposed a plan

375
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:24,950
Your plan is exactly what president Lu desires

376
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,680
Brother

377
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:30,240
Next you will make the tender scenario

378
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:33,960
If you don't mind, I want to offer a little help

379
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,799
No, Wu

380
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,000
What are you talking about?

381
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,359
How can I trouble you?

382
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,880
Despise me?

383
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:39,880
No

384
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,839
A deal

385
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,519
I also want to learn from you

386
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:43,480
Wu

387
00:19:59,200 --> 00:19:59,920
Hello, sir

388
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,599
Can I help you?

389
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:01,400
Yiming

390
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,000
I have a friend over there

391
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,880
Please

392
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,799
Ok, thank you

393
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:13,960
Traffic jam

394
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,640
What about the car repair?

395
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:16,680
Do you know the loss assessment?

396
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,319
Not yet

397
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,839
They need another two days

398
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:22,279
Why so slow?

399
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,359
Many car accidents these days

400
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,319
Excuse me

401
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:29,960
Ok

402
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:42,039
What do you want to eat?

403
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,079
Well, I need two cups of coffee

404
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:00,640
These two

405
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,680
Ok, wait a moment

406
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,400
Ok, thank you

407
00:21:23,474 --> 00:21:24,075
Hello

408
00:21:24,075 --> 00:21:24,779
Hello

409
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,799
Xiao Ni, I am Chen Yiming

410
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:27,759
Siyu is not around you?

411
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:28,440
Correct

412
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,920
Siyu is not here now

413
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,920
She went to the toilet

414
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,920
Mr. Chen, here's the thing

415
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:34,720
I have asked her just now

416
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:37,000
How much of the loan does sister Siyu want? 

417
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:40,319
Mr. Chen

418
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,039
Hello

419
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:41,960
How about this?

420
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,525
She will call you back

421
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,240
Ok

422
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:46,200
Thank you

423
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,720
Sir, your coffee

424
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:17,720
Hello, Zhou

425
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:18,880
I am Xiaoling

426
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:20,599
Beauty

427
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,519
Finally you remember to call me

428
00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:27,200
I have some incident

429
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,000
Can you lend me some money?

430
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,559
You find the wrong person

431
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:37,225
The most correct thing I did is despise you

432
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:44,319
Jack, I am Xiaoling

433
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,200
Xiaoling, who are you?

434
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:48,880
What is your relationship with my husband?

435
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,720
Xiaoping

436
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:55,680
Xiaoping?

437
00:22:56,119 --> 00:22:57,079
Xiaoping has run away

438
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,880
Something wrong with my face?

439
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:21,039
How much is the compensation?

440
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,960
I have told you

441
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,880
I don't know now

442
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,079
Li Siyu

443
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:32,079
This is my own business

444
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:34,039
You can't do like this every time

445
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:34,799
Every time you encounter a problem...

446
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:35,960
I've been independent since childhood

447
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,240
Yes, you are independent

448
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,279
I really appreciate it

449
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:44,160
I love it so much

450
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:47,359
But many things in the future

451
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:48,480
Including me

452
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:51,160
If you are too independent

453
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,319
it will create a sense of distance

454
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:54,519
I know

455
00:23:57,839 --> 00:23:58,480
Siyu

456
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,440
You're not alone

457
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,240
You still have me

458
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:08,960
I know

459
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,279
Ok, say it

460
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:17,039
How much is the compensation?

461
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,359
A lot of money

462
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:26,880
How come?

463
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:29,400
Both are good cars

464
00:24:30,775 --> 00:24:32,055
They have insurance, right?

465
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,160
Lanke didn't buy car insurance

466
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,359
Excuse me

467
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,599
We are recruiting students

468
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,039
Hello, you can have a look

469
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:47,240
You can come alone

470
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:48,599
Why do you take me with you?

471
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,640
It's the teacher's request

472
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:52,680
Dad must participate in the shuttle every week

473
00:24:52,839 --> 00:24:54,599
Education is not just mom's thing

474
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:55,799
It's also a dad's business

475
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,480
I have a lot to do

476
00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:00,559
I didn't let you come every day

477
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,319
Only once a week

478
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,450
We should let teachers know

479
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:06,759
our family attach great importance to education

480
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:08,079
Hello, excuse me

481
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:10,200
Our dance school are recruiting students

482
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:12,079
But it's very cheap, 300 yuan each class

483
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:14,920
Liu Yang

484
00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:17,640
Look, the ballet class

485
00:25:17,799 --> 00:25:19,160
300 yuan each class

486
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:21,279
Do you think Yuwei needs this?

487
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:22,240
Ok

488
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,440
Yes

489
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:27,000
Miaomiao learns ballet from the age of 3

490
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,640
Yuwei is four years old now

491
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:33,119
300 yaun is a little expensive

492
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:34,920
Yes

493
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:37,640
No

494
00:25:38,025 --> 00:25:40,680
Each of Miaomiao's class is 500 yuan  

495
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,559
I am echoing your words

496
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,319
We need it even if it's expensive 

497
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:51,920
Even if she is not a dancer

498
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,160
it's good to cultivate her temperament

499
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,680
Look at the girl

500
00:25:54,825 --> 00:25:56,759
it's very good for her temperament

501
00:25:56,759 --> 00:25:57,559
It's very important

502
00:25:57,559 --> 00:25:58,079
Ok

503
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,799
Why are you so generous today?

504
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:07,839
I got the bonus

505
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:09,850
Really?

506
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:13,599
I forgot to ask you

507
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:15,519
How is the report today?

508
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:16,599
Guess

509
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:20,359
The leaders are satisfied?

510
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:23,000
More than that

511
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,275
He announced that I would lead the tender team on the spot

512
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,799
Really?

513
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,640
So you become the team leader?

514
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,359
Husband, I know you are great

515
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:36,759
Look at you

516
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:37,960
Just a team leader

517
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,039
You are so happy now

518
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,000
I am not a director now

519
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:42,920
Next step is the director

520
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,519
Not sure

521
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,880
Talk about bonus first

522
00:26:47,675 --> 00:26:52,759
I got the annual energy saving innovation first prize for my plan

523
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,160
Bonus

524
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,400
RMB 50,000

525
00:26:56,119 --> 00:26:56,880
50,000?

526
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,720
Great

527
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:03,599
I will send 30,000 to my mom

528
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,079
And leave 20,000 yuan to Yuwei

529
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:10,050
Siyu and Xiaoling are in trouble

530
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,400
They need money now

531
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,160
Give your mom 10,000 yuan

532
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,279
Give the rest to sister Siyu

533
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,720
I am afraid it's no ok

534
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,000
What's the problem?

535
00:27:21,475 --> 00:27:24,440
They are closer than my blood sisters

536
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,319
It's ok

537
00:27:55,319 --> 00:27:56,680
4S shop often demands an exorbitant price 

538
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,079
We can discuss with them about the price

539
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:03,279
Yes, we will

540
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,225
But it won't change a lot

541
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:12,839
Actually Zhizhi has nothing to do with this

542
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,559
As for Xiaoling

543
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,880
she gave all her incomes to the specialty stores

544
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:20,991
So I have to pay the money

545
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,720
I will pay the money

546
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,799
I saved some money

547
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,440
I planned to pay the down payment for the house

548
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:38,125
Well, I can take out the half for the compensation

549
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,400
I can afford it

550
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,960
I know you can afford it

551
00:28:46,525 --> 00:28:51,175
But you will have no savings after the compensation

552
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:53,039
We can re-earn the money

553
00:28:56,519 --> 00:28:57,759
Don't exclude me

554
00:28:57,759 --> 00:28:58,480
Siyu

555
00:29:03,025 --> 00:29:05,839
I don't think it's appropriate

556
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,839
At least, I need to pay at least half

557
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,640
It's not a small number

558
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,240
Yes

559
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,880
It's not a small number

560
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:24,559
Not a small number

561
00:29:24,975 --> 00:29:31,700
But compared with our future, it's nothing, right?

562
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,119
Yiming

563
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,720
Thank you

564
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,720
But I have one condition

565
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,680
Yes

566
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,075
No matter what difficulties, I will be the first one to know

567
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:01,160
You can't hide a secret from me

568
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,900
I am not an outsider

569
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:05,960
I'll try

570
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:08,279
A promise

571
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:16,079
Now I really have a problem

572
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,759
To tell you

573
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:25,480
Say it

574
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,039
Miaomiao's mom

575
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,880
Sorry for yesterday

576
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,160
Something happened to my sister

577
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:34,160
Yuwei was sleepy

578
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,950
So we just went home

579
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:37,039
Miaomiao -I am so sorry

580
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:37,880
School is over

581
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:38,880
Come...

582
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,160
Are you a good girl, today?

583
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:41,960
Miaomiao

584
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,559
Did the teacher praise you today?

585
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:44,440
Miaomiao looks so good today

586
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,400
Look at the hairpin

587
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,359
Yuwei's parents

588
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,000
Yuwei

589
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,559
Goodbye

590
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:57,050
Yuwei has a bad time with other kids today

591
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,400
But it's ok now

592
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,650
You just need to comfort her after you go back

593
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:00,279
Ok

594
00:31:00,279 --> 00:31:01,000
Goodbye teacher

595
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:01,720
Thank you, teacher

596
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,680
See you tomorrow

597
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,279
See you tomorrow

598
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,075
Wait for me

599
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:16,440
She didn't tell me a word so far

600
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,920
This is a dangerous signal

601
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:23,839
You can't take it lightly

602
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,200
I...

603
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:30,079
Did I offend president Pan?

604
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:33,519
It has nothing to do with you

605
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:35,519
They come for me

606
00:31:40,475 --> 00:31:42,640
Sister Yuan leads me ever since I work here

607
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,725
She taught me how to talk to clients

608
00:31:46,875 --> 00:31:49,640
She is my tutor

609
00:31:51,725 --> 00:31:56,000
Yeah, the competition between disciple and master is inappropriate

610
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:05,039
But the director will have shares

611
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,225
One year of salary and the year-end bonus 

612
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:10,525
is enough for the compensation

613
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:14,300
And president Pan names you as the leader

614
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:18,875
It's inappropriate for you to refuse rashly

615
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:22,240
So what should I do?

616
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,160
Have you discussed with sister Yuan?

617
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:35,559
I didn't have the time

618
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:37,680
Call her

619
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,640
Tell her about this

620
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,039
Li Siyu

621
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:46,720
Answer it

622
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:52,725
Sister Yuan, I have something important to tell you

623
00:32:52,839 --> 00:32:53,599
Where are you now?

624
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,119
I'm in the hospital

625
00:32:57,119 --> 00:32:58,160
I have a fever

626
00:32:58,839 --> 00:32:59,920
I'm here for an infusion

627
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:01,640
Did you finish it?

628
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,759
Soon

629
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,880
Which hospital?

630
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,680
I will pick you up

631
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,759
I'm at blue cross hospital

632
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:08,839
Ok

633
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:09,960
See you later

634
00:33:15,025 --> 00:33:16,400
You should have a good talk

635
00:33:16,525 --> 00:33:18,119
You should make it clear, then you will have no misunderstandings

636
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:18,960
Bye

637
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:19,519
Bye

638
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:37,799
Zhizhi

639
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:38,920
Sister Siyu 

640
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:40,880
I have 40,000 yuan here

641
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:43,000
Liu Yang just took the bonus today

642
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,200
You can take it

643
00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:47,079
Zhizhi, don't worry about it

644
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,279
I have discussed with Yiming

645
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:50,880
We will pay the money

646
00:33:51,475 --> 00:33:53,240
I have something to do, that's all

647
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,279
Ok

648
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:56,440
Ok, byebye

649
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,119
You don't want to give it to her

650
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,359
Sister Siyu doesn't need it at all

651
00:34:07,925 --> 00:34:09,639
Since Li Siyu doesn't need it

652
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,119
I will give my mom 30,000

653
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,159
and Yuwei 20,000

654
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:14,840
Give your mom 10,000

655
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,039
Yuwei will take 40,000

656
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:20,400
You want to give my mom money as little as possible, right?

657
00:34:22,824 --> 00:34:26,879
We give your mom money every month

658
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:28,840
No penny less

659
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,800
Give my mom 20,000

660
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,199
Yuwei will have 30,000 

661
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,350
Mom needs to repair the house roof 

662
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,375
And my father's grave

663
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,559
What's wrong? Unhappy?

664
00:34:48,225 --> 00:34:50,440
You had a bad time with them?

665
00:34:51,079 --> 00:34:53,760
Miaomiao and them don't play with me

666
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,280
Why?

667
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,360
I do not know

668
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,760
You can play with other kids

669
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,700
You have some many kids in kindergarten

670
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,440
You do not understand

671
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:07,725
Miaomiao and them have the highest quality

672
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,639
I won't be worried when Yuwei play with them

673
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,750
I don't think Miaomiao's mom is great

674
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,400
Miaomiao's mom just barely talks

675
00:35:22,325 --> 00:35:24,679
Why did elite group kick me out?

676
00:35:34,119 --> 00:35:36,000
Don't answer

677
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,199
Come, Yuwei

678
00:35:39,559 --> 00:35:40,360
Hurry

679
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:43,599
Baby, change your shoes

680
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:44,239
Come

681
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:47,559
Come

682
00:35:47,559 --> 00:35:49,119
Mom, I want to watch TV

683
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:49,760
Ok

684
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,920
Only one episode

685
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:55,800
Ok

686
00:36:20,039 --> 00:36:21,119
This is for Yuwei

687
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:23,039
I need a flavored one

688
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:23,800
Flavor

689
00:36:29,025 --> 00:36:31,239
Why are you in a hurry?

690
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,325
I'll cook

691
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,360
And after eating, you just put it here

692
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,119
I will wash it

693
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,719
You just need to keep an eye onYuwei

694
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,440
Where are you doing?

695
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:46,039
I need to see Miaomiao's mom

696
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:48,450
She is the administrator of the parents group

697
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,239
I need to ask, why I was kicked out

698
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:53,119
Is this necessary?

699
00:36:53,719 --> 00:36:55,679
Of course it's necessary

700
00:36:56,325 --> 00:36:58,400
I said from the beginning, you would ask for trouble with money

701
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,679
You will see

702
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,599
Sister Yuan

703
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:27,000
Siyu

704
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,079
Thank you for helping me pick up Mengmeng today

705
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,480
It's ok

706
00:37:37,719 --> 00:37:39,000
What did you eat tonight?

707
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:39,800
Instant noodles

708
00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:42,199
I gave you the money to order takeaway, right?

709
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,700
Ordering takeaway at school will have a bad influence

710
00:37:45,079 --> 00:37:46,039
Did you finish your homework?

711
00:37:46,039 --> 00:37:46,760
Not yet

712
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,039
Why?

713
00:37:49,275 --> 00:37:51,039
You played games again?

714
00:37:51,175 --> 00:37:53,376
I did my homework

715
00:37:55,875 --> 00:37:58,159
Kids have too much homework

716
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:11,440
President Pan talked to me today

717
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:14,199
I know

718
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:21,559
What do you think of it?

719
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:24,599
I will do as you say

720
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,679
Sister Yuan

721
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:46,719
Are you ok?

722
00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:04,519
Sister Yuan

723
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,519
Sister Yuan

724
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,000
It's ok

725
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:29,039
I just feel so sad

726
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:30,800
It's not worth it

727
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:32,920
I can understand

728
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,760
Thirteen years

729
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,320
I have been drinking and socializing day and night

730
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,400
Overwork and business trips

731
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,719
Company's performance has risen year by year

732
00:39:48,039 --> 00:39:49,519
But what have I got?

733
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,679
Husband ran away with someone

734
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,199
Mengmeng is getting rebellious

735
00:40:00,679 --> 00:40:01,760
I am sick

736
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:03,920
They have all kinds of rumors about me

737
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:09,150
Sister Yuan, we all know you have sacrificed for Lubao

738
00:40:09,719 --> 00:40:10,599
So what?

739
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:13,280
On seniority and contribution

740
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,300
the sales director belongs to me

741
00:40:16,159 --> 00:40:17,599
Why does the company do this?

742
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,440
The company...

743
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:24,519
may consider something

744
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:26,239
Who will consider for me?

745
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,960
I am thirty-five years old

746
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,920
The diretor

747
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,320
Now or never

748
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:46,840
Sister Yuan

749
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,119
Do not worry

750
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:51,800
The director will be yours

751
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:53,360
I won't be the team leader

752
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:54,559
And no matter who is the team leader

753
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:55,519
I will be in your team

754
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:58,920
You have figured it out?

755
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:03,725
I will tell president Pan tomorrow morning

756
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,320
Siyu

757
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:10,960
Thank you

758
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:13,880
Sister Yuan

759
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:15,920
Take it back

760
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,280
We have worked together for seven years

761
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,159
Thank you

762
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:31,840
He is watching

763
00:41:36,679 --> 00:41:37,480
Let's get in the car

764
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,119
What's the matter? Say it

765
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,725
Where are you? So noisy?

766
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:16,800
Meng's store

767
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,519
Will you come?

768
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:18,480
I won't

769
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,199
Haowen

770
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,159
You told me, one of your friends is a headhunter, right?

771
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:25,679
Recommend him to me

772
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:28,800
You need some rest and be free for some time, right?

773
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,519
Li Siyu has some trouble

774
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,199
I can't be free now

775
00:42:33,575 --> 00:42:37,639
You are so considerate before you become her husband

776
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,280
Sarcasm 

777
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,275
You would be like me if it happened to you

778
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,599
Impossible

779
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,950
Have you helped me to make an appointment with Gu Xiaoling?

780
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:47,840
Here

781
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,320
You should drink

782
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,199
Go...

783
00:42:50,199 --> 00:42:51,039
That's all

784
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:52,599
Don't forget, hurry

785
00:42:52,599 --> 00:42:53,775
I'll give it to me

786
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:54,920
Go, have some drink

787
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,320
Don't microwave it?

788
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:08,519
It's ok

789
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:13,625
Miaomiao's mom scolded me

790
00:43:14,199 --> 00:43:14,800
She?

791
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:18,519
Why?

792
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:20,519
All because of you

793
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,800
She kicked me out because you didn't take Yuwei

794
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:25,239
to participate in the activity yesterday

795
00:43:26,719 --> 00:43:28,440
She says, we have no concept of time

796
00:43:29,079 --> 00:43:30,119
We disrespect the rules

797
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:31,079
Disrespect others

798
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:33,360
Is she insane?

799
00:43:33,875 --> 00:43:37,199
I think she estranged kids from Yuwei

800
00:43:40,199 --> 00:43:41,325
Great that you are not in that group

801
00:43:41,525 --> 00:43:42,920
We won't talk to her in the future

802
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,000
I'm afraid Yuwei will feel bad

803
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:47,320
Don't worry about this

804
00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:50,725
Kids will have playmates after all

805
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:51,639
Don't worry
