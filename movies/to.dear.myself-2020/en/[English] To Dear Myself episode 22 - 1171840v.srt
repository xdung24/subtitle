[To Dear Myself]

3
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,200
[Episode 22]

4
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,200
Was it the intern?

5
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,900
Didn't everyone persuade you to forget her?

6
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,300
I already broke things off with her.

7
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,000
That's good.

8
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,400
I've already sacrificed my emotions and Xiao Wei to go back to my family

9
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,500
but look at Zhang Zhizhi. She still made a big scene.

10
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,000
You can't blame Zhizhi entirely for this.

11
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,200
Then is it completely my fault?

12
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:42,700
Well, everyone is responsible for something like this.

13
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:48,400
Liu Yang is so honest. I can't believe he would do something like this.

14
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,600
I suddenly remember something you said.

15
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,800
"In every man's heart lives a jerk."

16
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,700
I don't know.

17
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,800
I don't know anything.

18
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,840
For this family,

19
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,600
I work hard from early morning to late at night. I bear all the hardship without complaint.

20
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,200
I don't know what I did wrong.

21
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,000
I don't know what I did wrong.

22
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
All right, don't cry anymore.

23
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,100
In my experience, crying about it is useless.

24
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,100
Letting it out is also good.

25
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:38,580
Liu Yang, right now, there's no one else. Just us.

26
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,800
Tell me the truth. What are you and that girl—

27
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,800
I already said,

28
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,600
nothing happened between us.

29
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,200
Then, why would Zhizhi act like this?

30
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:09,140
Between the two of us, we gave some little gifts to each other.

31
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,020
So you had feelings for her?

32
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:18,200
Liu Yang has such a cowardly and conservative personality,

33
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,400
but his actions today

34
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,200
as well as the little gifts you mentioned like cups and scarves,

35
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,000
I think even if there is something between the two of them, it probably just started.

36
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,800
It can't start though! There can't be anything at all!

37
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,700
As a person who has some experience in these kinds of things, I'm advising her to calm down.

38
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,300
First, you have to  think about what you will do in the future

39
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,000
instead of just getting angry in the present.

40
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,200
What brilliant ideas do you have then?

41
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,500
She's very pure.

42
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,300
Very kind and hardworking.

43
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,600
We both come from the countryside.

44
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,000
So no matter what I said, she would understand.

45
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:09,240
Being with her made me feel relaxed.

46
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,200
It's like I'm back in my college days,

47
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,000
a time without worries.

48
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,800
No matter how great she is, aren't you married?

49
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,600
As a married man, I don't think I've let down this family.

50
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,600
In order to support the house, car, wife, and daughter,

51
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,900
I wake up earlier than a chicken and sleep later than a donkey.

52
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,230
At work,

53
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:41,200
I have to pretend to be happy and humble.

54
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:45,600
After getting home, I have to listen to my wife's complaints.

55
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,360
I have to endure everything at work.

56
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,900
After getting home, I still have to endure things.

57
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,030
My only wrongdoing...

58
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,200
is that I am not a robot.

59
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,300
I'm tired, I feel oppressed.

60
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,700
Yes. You also don't have it easy.

61
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,300
Suddenly, one day,

62
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,960
a person appeared.

63
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,200
In front of her, I could smile.

64
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,100
I could forget about the competition at work.

65
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,600
I could forget the annoyances at home.

66
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:41,600
Yiming, if it were you, wouldn't you have been moved?

67
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,900
What do you plan to do from now on?

68
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:53,400
Zhizhi, you've devoted yourself to him for so many years,

69
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,800
and Liu Yang is about to become a director.

70
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,900
If you choose to get divorced at this time, then aren't you letting them off too easily?

71
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:12,300
Zhizhi, no matter what you choose,

72
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,000
our side of the family will support you.

73
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,400
I won't get together with Xiao Wei.

74
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:23,550
However, Zhizhi made such a huge scene today,

75
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,000
I really can't deal with her anymore.

76
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,800
Are you really going to get a divorce?

77
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,700
Zhizhi,

78
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,600
you need to think clearly.

79
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,700
What kind of outcome do you want?

80
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,500
Do you really want to divorce Liu Yang or not?

81
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,200
If we really got a divorce,

82
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,860
what would happen to Yuwei?

83
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
So, Zhizhi and I will not get a divorce.

84
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,900
I don't want a divorce.

85
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:43,000
If so many people came to get me after school every day, that would be great.

86
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,600
Bye, Yuwei.

87
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,800
- Bye-bye. 
 - Bye-bye.

88
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,100
Zhizhi, call me if you need anything.

89
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,800
Hey, Liu Yang.

90
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,800
After getting home, have a better attitude.

91
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,400
Comfort Zhizhi and admit fault, okay?

92
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,300
Be good, okay?

93
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,000
Come on, baby.

94
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,900
Go to your room and play.

95
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,100
Are you okay?

96
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,700
I'm fine.

97
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,000
Every time we get involved in Xiaoling's and Zhizhi's issues,

98
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
you seem to go crazy, losing your sense of logic.

99
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,400
It's so scary.

100
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,400
What are you afraid of? I don't act that way towards you.

101
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,400
I'm not afraid.

102
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:48,000
I just think that some things require you to be calm.

103
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Especially when it comes to other people's family issues.

104
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,800
If our actions are too rash, then they won't be able to turn things around.

105
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,200
I was just too angry.

106
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,700
He hit his own wife and even did those kinds of things (cheating).

107
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,000
Hitting his wife was definitely wrong,

108
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:08,000
but we also don't really understand their situation. Right?

109
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,200
I think all things

110
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,900
have their reasons for happening.

111
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:17,460
You seem to be very understanding of him.

112
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,190
I don't understand him.

113
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:21,840
I think that as long as we are human,

114
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,910
we will experience all sorts of problems.

115
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,300
When we are met with a problem, we should solve it.

116
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,420
There is nothing we can't solve.

117
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:34,330
We won't have this type of problem, right?

118
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:40,160
What are you randomly imagining?

119
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,330
The problem between us now is

120
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:45,930
when will you resign to better your health?

121
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:52,030
Let me think about it.

122
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,110
Do you really have the mood to be online after everything that's happened?

123
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,670
Would you let it go already?

124
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:08,900
There is no way I can just let this go.

125
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,920
Didn't I apologize to you already? What more do you want from me?

126
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,570
I want you to break it off with her.

127
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:16,160
I already broke things off.

128
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,490
I want you to break things off with her in front of me!

129
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,590
What are you doing?

130
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:36,120
Call her.

131
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,010
I won't.

132
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:41,750
If you don't call, then I will.

133
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,840
- What's wrong with you? 
 - Give it to me!

134
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,150
What are you doing, Zhang Zhizhi?!

135
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:48,460
- Give it to me! 
 - Give? Give the phone to me!

136
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,540
Zhang Zhizhi!

137
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,400
- Zhang Zhizhi, open the door! 
 - No!

138
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,340
- Open the door! 
 - No!

139
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:00,930
Zhizhi! Zhizhi, if you have anything to say, can't we talk civilly? Open the door!

140
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:04,590
- I won't open it!  
 - If you don't, I'm going to kick open the door!

141
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,000
Hello, Brother Yang, are you all right?

142
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,360
Stop harassing Liu Yang!

143
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,460
Stop harassing Liu Yang!

144
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,770
Are you insane?

145
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:27,270
- Mama! 
 - I'm telling you!  You are not allowed to bother my mom.

146
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:30,860
I'm going to go to your workplace.

147
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:34,340
I want everyone at your workplace to know what kind of rubbish she is!

148
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,360
I want to make it so that she can't continue to work there!

149
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,640
If you dare to go to my workplace, then we're getting divorced for sure!

150
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,890
Are you threatening me? You dare to threaten me?

151
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:46,810
- That is my bottom line! 
 - You still have a bottom line?

152
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:50,080
What are you doing?

153
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,740
Put it down. Are you insane?

154
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,810
Bastard!

155
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:57,590
Bastard!

156
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,220
Bastard!

157
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,930
Bastard!

158
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:44,600
[Mom]

159
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:54,880
Don't cry. It's fine, it's fine.

160
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,300
- Hello, Mom? 
 - Hi, Zhizhi.

161
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,970
Did you call me just now?

162
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:10,180
No, I think I called the wrong person.

163
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:14,120
Are you guys doing well?

164
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,460
I'm great, Mom.

165
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,790
Are you well?

166
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:22,820
I'm great. After getting home, the water and air have been great,

167
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:26,210
 so my health is much better now. All right, 

168
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:29,980
I will hang up now. I have to go and dance.

169
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,290
Brother Yang, are you here?

170
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:59,590
Earlier, your wife called and scolded me.

171
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:02,050
It's fine. For you, I don't care.

172
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:05,040
Even if the whole world scolds me, I won't be afraid.

173
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,670
I still haven't finished the medicine you bought me.

174
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:10,890
The words you said to me are still in my ears.

175
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:13,190
The kiss you gave me

176
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:15,990
still makes me feel warm.

177
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:19,670
Brother Yang, even if we cannot be together in this lifetime,

178
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:22,770
I will never forget the love you've given me

179
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:25,710
 during this time.

180
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,720
She continuously jumped.

181
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,160
Just like what the witch said,

182
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,000
every leap

183
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,230
is like walking on a blade.

184
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:33,860
Mom, was the little mermaid not afraid of getting hurt?

185
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:36,410
Everyone is afraid of getting hurt,

186
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,250
but loving a person

187
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:42,210
- will make you— 
 - fearless toward pain.

188
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,990
hurt even more.

189
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,980
Dad is back.

190
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,970
That's the neighbor.

191
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:34,120
But she willingly endured the pain.

192
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,930
Beside the prince,

193
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:40,210
she walks lightly and gracefully like foam.

194
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:10,400
Are you kicking me out?

195
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:17,010
I don't want to see you.

196
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,030
[Liu Yang]

197
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,580
I have moved out of the house.

198
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:29,030
Dad!

199
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:31,250
Dad!

200
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,840
Hi, Big Aunt and Little Aunt!

201
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:44,880
Good. Yuwei, you are so well-behaved.

202
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,840
Yuwei!

203
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,630
Let me see if you got prettier.

204
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:53,050
You are so pretty!

205
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:55,860
Look at what I brought you.

206
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,420
Do you like it?

207
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:00,610
Also, some nuts! You will get smarter after you eat this.

208
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:02,720
There are no peanuts inside.

209
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:05,820
There is something else you like.

210
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,890
What's this?

211
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:09,910
- Do you like it? 
 - I like!

212
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:11,550
Take them.

213
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:13,560
Here. Can you hold it all?

214
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,590
I can.

215
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:17,450
Go play.

216
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:26,510
What's going on?

217
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:29,410
He isn't willing to apologize to me.

218
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:31,830
He isn't willing to break up with that woman as well.

219
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:35,140
They are still contacting each other.

220
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:37,080
Asshole!

221
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:40,240
But you kicking him out is not a good strategy.

222
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,920
Why do keep a guy like that? Fatten him up to cook for dinner?

223
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,690
If that woman seizes the opportunity to really get with him,

224
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:49,370
then it would be too late for Zhizhi to regret it.

225
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,580
Mom!

226
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,210
Coming.

227
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:03,050
What are you doing?

228
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:07,010
Why are you pulling on me? This is a new jacket. It's very expensive!

229
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:09,520
Why do you keep persuading her to get back with him?

230
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,380
Can't you let her make her own decision?

231
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:15,530
Li Siyu, can you not always think about things from your own perspective?

232
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:17,670
Zhizhi is not you or me.

233
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:20,220
This family is her life. She cannot survive without this family.

234
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:24,350
Zhizhi was very independent when she was young. She became like this after being with Liu Yang.

235
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:27,630
- Can you get her to go back to when she was young? 
 - She cannot rely on that man.

236
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:29,660
Maybe it's good for her to leave him.

237
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,780
- How about the kid? 
 - I can help her take care of the child.

238
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:34,800
Don't indulge in the wildest fantasy. Are you someone who can lead a family life?

239
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,870
Do you want Yuwei to eat takeout food with you?

240
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:16,300
Zhizhi,

241
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:19,630
do you want to divorce Liu Yang or not?

242
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:24,050
I don't know.

243
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:28,740
If you don't want to, then ask him to come back.

244
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:32,100
Siyu slapped him. Consider it as venting your anger.

245
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,880
I think he won't dare to hit you again.

246
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:41,790
Yiming said that

247
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:44,260
before you knew about everything,

248
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:47,050
Liu Yang already broke things off with that woman.

249
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:52,010
I saw that woman send Wechat messages to him again.

250
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:54,260
Stop thinking about that right now.

251
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:57,910
Think about whether you want to continue this marriage with Liu Yang or not.

252
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:04,890
To be honest, you two have not seen much of the outside world.

253
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:08,690
Liu Yang's asshole actions are just elementary level.

254
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:10,950
If you still want to continue being with Liu Yang,

255
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:14,020
just consider this time a lesson for him

256
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:16,320
and end it on a good note.

257
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:19,560
If you don't want to continue being with him,

258
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,190
make a decision quickly.

259
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,960
Sister Siyu,

260
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,980
do you also think that I should forgive him?

261
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:48,250
You still have Yuwei.

262
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,080
You must first think carefully about

263
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,260
what kind of life you want to live.

264
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:05,720
If you want to have the family complete and whole,

265
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:10,110
then there are certain things that you have to let go of.

266
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:23,640
Didn't you persuade them to make peace? Why did they separate?

267
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,890
Ask Liu Yang.

268
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,830
Liu Yang is actually not a bad person.

269
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:33,870
He is just too tired.

270
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:36,560
Hurting Zhizhi like this, is he still not considered a bad person?

271
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:39,540
The way Zhizhi dealt with things sometimes,

272
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:42,360
really embarrassed Liu Yang.

273
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,620
What do you think Zhizhi should have done then?

274
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:48,720
Be understanding of his difficulties? Forgive his cheating?

275
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,340
Or even self-criticize her own mistakes?

276
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,790
Forget about it. You are a sick person.

277
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:59,580
I'm not going to discuss this with you.

278
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:21,560
- Liu Yang has hurt Zhizhi yet she still won't get a divorce. Why?
- Why?

279
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:26,120
Isn't it because the family can't do without Liu Yang? Isn't it because Zhizhi and Yuwei need him?

280
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,570
What are you trying to say?

281
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:31,720
We have been arguing and going back and forth but you just have one intention.

282
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,810
You want me to quit my job.

283
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:38,140
Did I say that?

284
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:40,710
Have I said a word about wanting you to quit?

285
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:43,620
This is what you want from the bottom of your heart even if you didn't speak it out.

286
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:48,670
Chen Yiming, let me tell you! I'm afraid that I'll have to suffer like Zhizhi if something happens one day.

287
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:52,090
- I'm not Liu Yang. 
 - But you are also a man!

288
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:55,170
You can't presume that I'm the same as Liu Yang just because I'm also a man.

289
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:57,320
No one can make any guarantees.

290
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:01,360
That's right. No one can make any guarantees. But that's the future. What I'm talking about is the present!

291
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,880
The present is the beginning of the future.

292
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,190
I must have my own career.

293
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:09,530
I hope I can live without anyone.

294
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,800
I know!

295
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,880
You are doing this for my own good.

296
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,140
But...

297
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:41,650
if you really consider things from my perspective,

298
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:44,090
don't say those things anymore.

299
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:53,660
Let's talk about getting married after Lubao's financing.

300
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:03,150
I'm leaving.

301
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:50,390
[88 Barbecue]

302
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:11,280
Boss! One more beer, please.

303
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,140
All right. Coming!

304
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,110
I was over there and thought that it looked like you. I can't believe it really is you!

305
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:35,310
- What brings you here? 
 - Sit, sit.

306
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:37,250
You also sit, GM Wang.

307
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:42,270
Why are you here alone? Where is Siyu?

308
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:44,510
Siyu is working overtime.

309
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:46,610
- Working overtime again? 
 - That's right.

310
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:49,460
It's so cost-effective for Pan Zhiyu to use Siyu.

311
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:54,860
GM Wang, would you like to have some skewers?

312
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:58,010
Okay! I haven't eaten since noon.

313
00:34:58,010 --> 00:34:59,750
Really?

314
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,800
- Your beer. 
 - This taste really good.

315
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,330
Yeah?

316
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:09,660
- Help me heat them up and bring some more lamb skewers. 
 - Okay, no problem.

317
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:11,830
- Thank you. 
 - Please wait for a moment. You are welcome.

318
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:14,610
It's cold already. Don't eat if it's cold.

319
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:16,520
Have some hot ones later.

320
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:25,380
Would you like to have some beer?

321
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,820
I have some good wine in my car. It goes well with skewers.

322
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,680
Sure!

323
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:37,110
Boss, bring two cups!

324
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:47,000
Xiao Wang,

325
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,380
bring a bottle of wine here from the car.

326
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,350
- Your cups. 
 - Open it, all right?

327
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:53,300
No need for cups.

328
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,950
Okay.

329
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:59,240
- Thank you. 
 - You're welcome.

330
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:03,500
Wow, it smells so nice.

331
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,590
Just give it to me.

332
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:08,280
Thank you.

333
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:11,820
Just wait a second.

334
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:24,200
- Let me know when it's enough. 
 - It's enough.

335
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,800
Thank you.

336
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,800
To...

337
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:41,220
- chance encounters. 
 - To chance encounters.

338
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:47,180
How is it?

339
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,000
It's quite...

340
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,000
This wine tastes very interesting with the skewers.

341
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,750
What type of wine is this?

342
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
The type is not important.

343
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,300
The important thing is the mood while drinking.

344
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:07,240
Well, GM Wang, your mood looks very good today.

345
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,000
In places outside of work, just call me Sister Ziru.

346
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,210
Sister Ziru.

347
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,200
How come you're drinking all alone?

348
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:26,200
Yeah.

349
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,800
Did you have another argument with Siyu?

350
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,600
We didn't argue.

351
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:38,200
It's just that there are some things

352
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,400
that we can't agree on.

353
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,660
That serious?

354
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,700
What kind of things?

355
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:53,500
A few days ago, she suddenly fainted.

356
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,800
I took her to the hospital.

357
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,100
They did a checkup at the hospital.

358
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:02,300
The results said she has exceeded normal values in all aspects.

359
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:05,200
I tried to persuade her to rest

360
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,400
but she thinks I'm forcing her to resign.

361
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,200
That's not what I mean, but

362
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,800
she just keeps trying to go against me.

363
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,900
Resigning is a huge thing.

364
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:21,600
Yes, but I wasn't trying to make her resign.

365
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:25,000
I just think that she needs to first better her health.

366
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,200
Once she is better, she can start working again,

367
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,900
right? But she seems to understand it differently.

368
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,960
Sister Ziru, I really—

369
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:40,600
I really feel despondent. I just don't understand

370
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,900
why the longer two people are together,

371
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:48,200
it somehow seems harder to understand each other.

372
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,140
According to my experiences,

373
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:59,500
it's easy to accept a person but understanding each other is really hard.

374
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:03,800
Disregarding two people who just started dating,

375
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:07,900
a husband and wife who want to spend a lifetime together

376
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:12,000
cannot simply ask for mutual understanding,. It is something that just happens with luck.

377
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,400
Sister Ziru,

378
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:22,400
you mean that I shouldn't force it.

379
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:26,020
My point is...

380
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,600
you still need to be more understanding.

381
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,600
Understanding?

382
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,800
Yes.

383
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,800
Of course, being understanding is the most difficult thing to do.

384
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,700
Sister Ziru, I...

385
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:44,400
I'm not trying to disrespect you.

386
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,100
I just want to ask...

387
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:51,100
How must women

388
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,400
be so competitive?

389
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:59,000
That's not necessarily true. It depends on what.

390
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Tha-That's right.

391
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,800
In the past, I always thought Siyu

392
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,000
was generous, took charge,

393
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,660
had a responsible heart,

394
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:12,800
and was especially independent in life.

395
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,000
I really thought all of that was great,

396
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,800
but now I think

397
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,800
you can't be that competitive in every aspect. Especially in life.

398
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,800
You can't just focus on your career your entire life, right?

399
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,200
I think—

400
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,400
I think I'm a woman who only has a career.

401
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,400
Sister Ziru, I...

402
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,200
Yiming,

403
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,910
you're right.

404
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:49,600
People can't just have a career alone.

405
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:56,500
Just like on my way here,

406
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,300
I was actually very lonely.

407
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:05,530
I was so lonely

408
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:09,200
that I thought everything was meaningless.

409
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,800
The suffocating feeling of being lonely

410
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,600
made me feel hopeless.

411
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,250
I actually saw your Wechat Moment.

412
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:33,400
I knew that you were also alone.

413
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,800
That's why I took the initiative to come here

414
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,000
because I was afraid—

415
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,800
I was afraid I would be alone tonight again.

416
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,000
Watching a movie alone.

417
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,200
Seeing someone else's story

418
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,500
to cry a little bit and laugh a little.

419
00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:00,190
Then I'd go home alone.

420
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,600
It's another lonely and long night.

421
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,900
Sister Ziru.

422
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:18,000
From now on,

423
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:22,000
if you need someone to talk to,

424
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,800
feel free to tell me.

425
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,900
I will be there for you.

426
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,900
Hello?

427
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:38,700
Where are you?

428
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,600
Siyu.

429
00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:12,720
If you don't want to resign, then don't.

430
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,800
I only have one request.

431
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,400
Please don't tire yourself out.

432
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:23,400
Don't work too hard. Don't ruin your body.

433
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:29,650
If you don't want to get married yet,

434
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:32,740
then I will respect that.

435
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:37,100
I still only have one condition.

436
00:44:39,970 --> 00:44:42,720
If you choose to get married,

437
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:46,650
then that groom...

438
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,800
must be me.

439
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,600
Yiming.

440
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,200
Siyu, from now on,

441
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:18,800
I will do my best to stand in your shoes when thinking about problems.

442
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:23,800
I will do my best to understand you.

443
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,200
I will do my best. I will try harder than now.

444
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:33,000
I won't let you have any more worries

445
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,100
about the future.
