[To Dear Myself]

3
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,180
[Episode 24]

4
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:35,820
[Lubao New Energy was real-named reported for alleged bribery.]

5
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,920
[The biggest shady deal of the new energy battery industry.]

6
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,270
[Lubao New Energy exposed for bribery. It's value plummets.]

7
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,880
[Severe crack down on bribes and crimes, will Lubao become a target of public criticism?]

8
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,050
[Whether it is giving or accepting bribes, there should be severe punishment!] 
 [This kind of enterprise should be shut down. ]

9
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:48,300
[These people and companies that take public safety as a joke are social scum. Let's collectively boycott them.]

10
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:52,410
[Letting this kind of company produce car batteries?! Isn't that putting people's lives in danger?! Or are they trying to punish civilians!]

11
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:56,560
[How are they not embarassed to say that they are the leader of new energy batteries?!] 
 [Last year, my car combusted because of the Lubao battery!]

12
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,000
[Important, will Lubao batteries that have falsified data be recalled and refunds be given?]
 [Behinds the scenes, the big boss continues to not worry.]

13
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:01,430
90% are rumors!

14
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,050
There is 10% truth!

15
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:06,350
The 10% is not like what they wrote!

16
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:09,860
GM Pan, I suggest we find a lawyer to sue these rumor mongers.

17
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:12,030
Then we hold a press conference to clarify the truth.

18
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,690
You still don't think this issue is not big enough?

19
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:23,590
Li Siyu,

20
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:26,830
you must immediately,

21
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:29,470
at all costs,

22
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:32,680
reduce the impact

23
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,130
to the smallest.

24
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,600
Where are you? I need you.

25
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,190
I'll wait for you at the old place.

26
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,410
[Sorry]

27
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,530
President Wang, the secretary of Lubao's GM Pan called just now,

28
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:56,540
she said they are still open to discussing about the financing.

29
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:06,070
Tell her that I don't have time this week. I have to deal with a family issue.

30
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:09,170
We will meet next week.

31
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,440
You already know?

32
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,540
The new is spreading all over the internet.

33
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:51,690
You knew so many media before. Could you ask people to help control the spreading for us?

34
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,360
It's too late.

35
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:58,060
It's been twelve hours already since the news broke out.

36
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,570
It is widely spread and you already missed the best time to deal with it.

37
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:03,890
So there is no solution?

38
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:07,740
I assessed the situation before you arrived.

39
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,540
The main target is the public opinion of the shady dealings of the bidding.

40
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:14,320
There is almost no question about the quality of Lubao products.

41
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,240
It's lucky from this perspective.

42
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,510
But the outcome is definitely settled that your brand image and profit will be damaged.

43
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:24,120
So the only thing you can do is stop public sentiment from getting worse and out of hand.

44
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,180
That can reduce investors from leaving to a minimum.

45
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,040
This is why I came to you.

46
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,490
You must keep the confidence of the partners with us.

47
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,360
According to my planning experience for so many years...

48
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,580
First: you can't avoid. You can't hide.

49
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,560
You must take action.

50
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:47,030
Second: you should go and contact new and traditional media.

51
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:49,470
Based on the principle of communicating sincerely,

52
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:52,880
admit your mistake to the public and shoulder your responsibility.

53
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,710
Also, punish the related people immediately.

54
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:03,060
It's not my problem. Why should I admit it?

55
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,280
At least, you didn't avoid arousing suspicion.

56
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,030
I remember you told me at that time.

57
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:18,960
You said you must take part in the bidding. It's not only for yourself,

58
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,780
but also for Lubao.

59
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:24,430
Now, Lubao needs you to endure humiliation in order to

60
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,730
shoulder all the responsibilities.

61
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:36,480
How?

62
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,170
Resign.

63
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,640
I got it.

64
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,050
Siyu, there is another thing.

65
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:58,730
I think this whole thing shouldn't be a hot topic.

66
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:01,260
But it went viral like this.

67
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,910
I don't think it's in line with the propagation rule.

68
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:05,950
What do you mean?

69
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:09,840
- Someone is hiring people to influence public opinion. 
 - Who?

70
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,290
If you need, I can investigate it for you.

71
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:14,900
Okay.

72
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:29,750
GM Pan, go on the internet to see those comments.

73
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,700
We really can't delay this any longer.

74
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,300
If you still don't punish Li Siyu,

75
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,770
all the netizens will explode on the internet.

76
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:39,730
Once the company gets into trouble then the staff take the blame for the company.

77
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:42,870
This kind of irresponsible company,

78
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:45,190
how can we gain the staff's trust?

79
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:49,340
How can we ask the staff to fight and sacrifice for us?

80
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,530
- There should be people to take responsibility, right?
 - I will!

81
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:53,030
Absolutely not!

82
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:55,390
You are the Chairman of the Board and CEO.

83
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,470
It's better for me to take the blame instead of you!

84
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:00,600
It has had nothing to do with you from the beginning to the end!

85
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,020
But Lubao has something to do with me.

86
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,980
I will take the blame.

87
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:08,600
But Li Siyu as the party, if she doesn't get any punishment,

88
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,670
then it won't make any sense.

89
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,820
I can take all the responsibility by myself.

90
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,460
I consulted an expert.

91
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:26,370
He thinks that we must open a press conference as soon as possible.

92
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:30,270
Admit the mistake to the public and shoulder the responsibility.

93
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:34,350
Also, to quiet down the public sentiment,

94
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,620
to calm everything down,

95
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,050
I should take the blame and resign.

96
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,970
I will go and write my resignation report now.

97
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:43,540
Wait!

98
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:01,280
Fang Zhan, go and prepare a press conference now.

99
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,350
I will apologize to the public in person.

100
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:07,120
I will announce that Lubao has suspended Li Siyu from her duties.

101
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,710
- Can the public accept this? 
 - That's it. Go.

102
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,410
As a public enterprise,

103
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:22,690
for all the wicked public influence caused by this, 

104
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:25,620
we sincerely apologize to everyone.

105
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:29,870
As the chariman of the company, I feel deeply guilty and blame myself.

106
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:33,560
Now all the related staff have been suspended from their duties. 

107
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,640
They are under investigation now. I apologize again to the public, 

108
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,900
the supervision department, the shareholders of Lubao,

109
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:41,410
and all the friends who care for us.

110
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:43,530
We sincerely welcome the public and the media

111
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:46,840
to continue to monitor Lubao.

112
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:58,180
Finished?

113
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:06,640
♫  This city's too magical  ♫

114
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,770
It's okay.

115
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:13,410
It's okay.

116
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,360
It's okay. I'm here.

117
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:25,810
♫  The wishes I have made  ♫

118
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:28,350
♫ that I don't fulfill ♫

119
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,320
♫  Nights are filled with loneliness  ♫

120
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,150
♫  Nights are filled ♫

121
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:37,990
Let's go.

122
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:40,760
♫  Lights are dimming   ♫

123
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:45,350
♫  yet I'm awake  ♫

124
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:48,980
♫  Love and bittersweet joys  ♫

125
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:52,100
♫  Regrets  ♫

126
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:58,470
♫  You were by my side  ♫

127
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,140
♫  The world turns quickly  ♫

128
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:26,500
♫  Yet footsteps slow down  ♫

129
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
GM Pan has said that he just wanted me to take a break.

130
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
When the crisis finishes, I will go back.

131
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,800
♫  Who's shouting?  ♫

132
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,300
Let's not talk about it. Take a break first.

133
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,770
No.

134
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:50,800
I have been fighting for so many years and I've given so much to the company.

135
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,600
I won't give up easily.

136
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,870
But even though you won't give up,

137
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,800
you can't go back.

138
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,800
Why?

139
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,600
Think about it.

140
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,600
Now Lubao has announced that you were suspended from your duties,

141
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,000
but when the crisis finishes and you go back to your position immediately, what will the public think about Lubao?

142
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
They will definitely think that Lubao is covering up for you and taking the punishment lightly.

143
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,000
The public can put up with committing mistakes, but

144
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
they can't tolerate cheating.

145
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,200
Maybe it will cause new public sentiment at that time.

146
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,600
The public will forget about it quickly.

147
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,800
They won't even care about who becomes Lubao's sales director again.

148
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,100
I'm not as optimistic as you.

149
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,500
This is the result you hoped for, right?

150
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,000
I knew it.

151
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Why do you always think about me in this way?

152
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,200
Am I wrong?

153
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,870
Yes.

154
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,700
I do hope you can quit.

155
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,600
But this is the best solution to protect you and Lubao.

156
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,600
Also, you can take advantage of this time to get a good rest and nurse your health.

157
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,000
Is it a problem?

158
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,200
This is what I'm thinking. Is it wrong?

159
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,120
Siyu,

160
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,670
since it has happened,

161
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,200
let's face it actively.

162
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,600
Let's turn the bad thing into a good thing.

163
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,000
Here.

164
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,200
Sister Siyu, how is it going now?

165
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,800
He was sacked by his work.

166
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,400
What?

167
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:24,000
Zhizhi, sorry.

168
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:28,810
Can we remedy it? 

169
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:34,240
Is there any other way to help him?

170
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,800
Don't worry. It was me that started it.

171
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,100
I will take care of it to the end.

172
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:47,000
Zhizhi, do you still plan to divorce him?

173
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,000
Yes.

174
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,600
Yuwei!

175
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,800
- Are you happy today?

Let's go home.

177
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,800
President Wang, it's not easy to meet you.

178
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,300
No, I had to deal with a family issue.

179
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:28,400
I thought I could finish it in 2-3 days, but I was delayed for a week in the end.

180
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,200
Okay. Let's get down to business.

181
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,800
About my offer last time,

182
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,800
what do you think about it?

183
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,700
I also made an offer last time. What do you think about it now?

184
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,820
Your offer wasn't sincere at all.

185
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:49,400
GM Pan, the new incident to Lubao's valuation—

186
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,900
That little incident has no influence on Lubao.

187
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:56,000
This is the latest completion of the sales order and the purchase order.

188
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,400
From the data, no matter it's dealers or users, they are both confident in Lubao.

189
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,300
According to our latest evaluation, the valuation of Lubao

190
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,800
is severely damaged in this incident.

191
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,000
Your arithmetic is outdated now.

192
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,500
We believe that within the next 3 months,

193
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,000
the influence will fade out.

194
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,200
We will rebrand Lubao.

195
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,600
This is our rebranding plan.

196
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,000
The research and development of Lubao3 cost too much.

197
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,300
You can't make a profit in a short term unavoidably.

198
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,770
But the growth of Lubao3 in the market is very quick.

199
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:29,000
Also, the operating methods are mature now.

200
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,400
In the long run, the rate of return on an investment is very high.

201
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,800
We also have an evaluation of the return on investment.

202
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,540
Enough.

203
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:40,000

We must get 23%.

It's just one point. How about we get them back and continue talking about it?

215
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,200
Now, the Lubao bribery crisis is starting to quiet down already.

216
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,600
If we linger on, once they get a new investor,

217
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,800
It will be more difficult to negotiate.

First of all, you deserve it.

I will put two production lines first.

After five years, if there are ten production lines,

261
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,600
then half of the country's new energy industry is definitely Lubao's.

Siyu,

354
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,600
I didn't mean anything else just now.

355
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,600
I just wanted to tell you

356
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:49,000
that our future is getting better and better for sure.

357
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I'm able to take care of you now.

358
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,600
I can make you feel secure.

359
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,800
In the past, we talked about raising children and paying mortgage.

360
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:01,600
You really don't need to worry about them. They are on me now.

361
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,400
Just focus on being beautiful.

362
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:13,400
If I'm not beautiful and young anymore, will that mean

363
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:17,600
you won't pay for the mortgage and the kids?

364
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,200
See?

365
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,800
I knew that you were going to say that, that's why

366
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:31,200
I have been very hesitant on how I was supposed to tell you.

367
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:43,240
Hello? Yes. It's me.

368
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:47,280
Reporter? Which reporter? Oh, yes.

369
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,720
Hello, hello. Yes.

370
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:55,690
Okay, then send me the outline for the interview.

371
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,490
Yes.

372
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:02,260
My Wechat number is my phone number.

373
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,760
Yes. Just add me.

374
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,680
Okay. Then, about the interview time,

375
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,600
we can talk about that later.

376
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,280
Okay. Yes.

377
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:18,370
Goodbye.

378
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:28,490
Reporters these days have so much access to information. They caught up so quickly to me.

379
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:32,550
To tell you the truth, I'm really not willing to do interviews.

380
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:36,320
But now the company needs to do promotions, so I have no choice.

381
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,460
You're so busy.

382
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,160
Siyu,

383
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:45,500
in the future, I will get busier and busier.

384
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,260
So...

385
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:58,670
Hello? Director Qian?

386
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:02,210
You know this already?

387
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,420
That's great. Yes.

388
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:10,110
This time, we can work together and make something big.

389
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:15,190
I think we should first confirm their values.

390
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:18,720
Yes, no problem. I think my original plan was good.

391
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,960
We can talk about system regulations—

392
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:28,280
What?

393
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:31,360
Okay, no problem. Then we can talk about more when we see each other.

394
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,870
Yes. Yes.

395
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:40,600
Bye-bye.

396
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:50,520

Xiaoling said that her calls couldn't get through. She's very worried about you.

420
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:24,510
A few days ago, someone leaked my number.

421
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:28,370
So many keyboard warriors are calling me and sending insults my way, so I shut my phone off completely.

422
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:30,280
Do you want to get the police involved?

423
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,870
There's no need. There have been less these past few days.

424
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:35,190
Didn't you notice that I turned my phone back on?

425
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:37,610
That's good.

426
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:45,170
Have you been doing well these past few days?

427
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,390
Then what about Liu Yang?

428
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:06,740
He's been slacking on Yuwei's child support for over a week.

429
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:08,780
I went to find him.

430
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:11,590
He said he didn't have the money.

431
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:19,010
He doesn't have a job right now,

432
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:22,370
and he has to rent a house.

433
00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:25,190
He might actually not have it.

434
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:30,970
I'm not sure if he's lying or not,

435
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:35,700
but if, at the time, I had your confidence,

436
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:40,360
I could tell him that I didn't want any of the money he owed me,

437
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:44,110
but I couldn't say it.

438
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,580
Zhizhi, how much do you need? Is ¥5,000 enough?

439
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:55,420
Sister Siyu, I can't take your money.

440
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:57,750
I still have some savings.

441
00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:00,580
Zhizhi, this problem is partly my fault.

442
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:03,640
- Please, it will make me feel less guilty. 
 - Sister Siyu,

443
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:06,980
the situation with Liu Yang has nothing to do with you. Okay.

444
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:24,710
What are you planning to do now?

445
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:29,050
When he's stable,

446
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:32,200
we will go do all the paperwork.

447
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:36,120
Weren't you planning on forgiving him?

448
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,810
How come you're suddenly so determined to divorce?

449
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:42,440
I went to find him that day, but I found out

450
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,020
that he and Wei Yayun were already living together.

451
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:57,460
Then, are they still together?

452
00:42:58,050 --> 00:43:00,150
I don't know.

453
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:02,430
I don't want to know.

454
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:11,160
How are you doing?

455
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:15,110
I'm going to rest for a while.

456
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:18,160
Do you have any plans?

457
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,070
GM Pan said

458
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:22,920
when this storm clears,

459
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:25,020
he'll let me go back.

460
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:31,430
I heard a rumor.

461
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,280
About what?

462
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:37,520
Director Fang

463
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,070
is planning to bring Yuan Huizhong back.

464
00:43:41,290 --> 00:43:43,510
Back to the Sales Department?

465
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:45,660
He wants her to be Sales Director.

466
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:47,970
Mom!

467
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:52,210
Yuwei! Come.

468
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:54,310
- Are you happy today? 
 - Yes!

469
00:43:54,310 --> 00:43:57,070
Good. What did you learn today?

470
00:44:03,410 --> 00:44:05,830
Mr. Liu, hello.

471
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:07,890
We have already looked at your resumé,

472
00:44:07,890 --> 00:44:11,050
do you have any other requests to join?

473
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:12,780
My one request is to be able to join immediately.

474
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:15,330
Then you can report to work next Monday.

475
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:18,780
Thank you! Thank you!
