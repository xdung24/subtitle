00:01:27,525 --> 00:01:29,525
[To Dear Myself]

2
00:01:31,755 --> 00:01:33,755
[Ep3]

3
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:08,639
It's midnight

4
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,680
What are you doing here?

5
00:02:09,878 --> 00:02:10,799
Soon

6
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,400
What the hell

7
00:02:24,575 --> 00:02:26,759
You still want to associate with them?

8
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:28,400
I have told you, just never mind them

9
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,159
I thought about it

10
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:31,879
We can't be impulsive

11
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,719
Why?

12
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:35,280
Look

13
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:36,680
Miaomiao's family

14
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,919
Needless to talk about it

15
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,080
Linda is only four years old

16
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:42,131
She can speak three languages

17
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:46,624
Xingxing's parents are postdoctoral returnees

18
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:48,479
And that William

19
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:54,879
As I know, his grandpa is from a famous family in Shanghai bund

20
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:02,319
Does it have anything to do with us?

21
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:04,240
Of course it has

22
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:09,050
Why do we spend so much money for Yuwei

23
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:11,825
to go to a good kindergarten?

24
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:17,900
All because we want her to grow up in the best environment

25
00:03:19,275 --> 00:03:25,025
So we can't break away from them

26
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:27,960
Zhizhi

27
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:32,240
It's so obvious that we are not in their social circle

28
00:03:33,175 --> 00:03:36,199
Don't you feel tired of kissing their ass?

29
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,000
I do this for Yuwei, I don't mind it

30
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,560
Whatever

31
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,360
No

32
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:44,719
You need to help me

33
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:46,375
As I know, Miaomiao's grandma also

34
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:48,680
graduated from Chiao Tung University

35
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,439
Tomorrow you will go to pick up Yuwei with me

36
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,560
I will give the cookies to Miaomiao's mom

37
00:03:54,075 --> 00:03:57,560
You should get attached with Miaomiao's mom

38
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,360
Then let bygones be bygones

39
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,080
I won't go

40
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,360
You must go

41
00:04:03,675 --> 00:04:07,520
We didn't tell them in advance that we wouldn't participate in the activity

42
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,919
It's our fault

43
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,719
We need to apologize to them

44
00:04:11,175 --> 00:04:13,475
We should have chosen the ordinary kindergarten

45
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:14,840
We won't have these troubles

46
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,720
Liu Yang

47
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,560
Will ordinary kindergartens have enough hardware facilities

48
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,079
Will they have one-to-one tutoring?

49
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:26,680
Do they often organize the off-campus tours?

50
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:28,920
Are the teachers all senior preschool teachers?

51
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,160
Do they teach Go?

52
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,775
The tuition is just there

53
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:39,275
Before, we couldn't afford the tuition

54
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,040
Fortunately, we have the new policy

55
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:44,079
So she can be admitted so easily

56
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:45,319
You can go without me

57
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,560
For Yuwei

58
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:38,600
Are you sleeping?

59
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,120
Not yet

60
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,040
I am studying the knowledge of auto repair

61
00:05:44,075 --> 00:05:47,625
Did you contact the auto spare parts agent I recommended?

62
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:49,720
Yes

63
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:51,680
I also contacted other stores

64
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,079
Ok, go to bed early

65
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:56,959
You too, good night

66
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,399
President Pan

67
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:44,720
I have thought about it

68
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,800
I can't be the team leader

69
00:06:47,675 --> 00:06:49,639
I won't compete for the director

70
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:56,720
That's a rare opportunity

71
00:06:58,839 --> 00:06:59,920
I am still young

72
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,800
I will have many opportunities in the future

73
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:06,000
It's not easy for sister Yuan

74
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,400
And with her ability and contribution

75
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,120
she is eligible for director

76
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:21,920
Did Yuan Huizhong say anything sensational to you?

77
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,680
No

78
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,319
It's my own decision

79
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:29,000
Li Siyu

80
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,200
You are good sisters

81
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,160
Ok, you are here to take a stand, I can understand

82
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:37,120
I get it, you can go back

83
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,399
I'm not here to take a stand

84
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,079
That's what I am thinking about

85
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:42,879
So what I told you was just a nonsense?

86
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,439
President Pan

87
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,480
I know

88
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,879
Competition is normal in business

89
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:55,519
I really can't do it

90
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:56,560
You can't do it

91
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,120
It doesn't mean that others can't do it

92
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:58,879
Understand?

93
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:02,439
You don't need to sacrifice yourself to help others

94
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:03,639
It doesn't make sense here

95
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,959
President Pan, I still insist

96
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,720
I get it

97
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,480
You can go now

98
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:17,519
Hello

99
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:22,040
Can you help me make an appointment again?

100
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,879
I am free recently

101
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:28,600
Ok, thank you very much

102
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:30,720
Ok

103
00:08:33,558 --> 00:08:34,359
Please come in

104
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,399
How's it?

105
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,960
I have said I won't be the team leader

106
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,600
I won't compete for the director

107
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:49,919
What did Pan say?

108
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:52,720
He drove me out

109
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:54,440
So it makes no difference

110
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:07,919
Siyu

111
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,411
The company's appointment will ask for employees' opinion

112
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:17,320
He can't change anthing as long as you insist

113
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:22,480
I'll see him later

114
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,440
Ok

115
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,039
Come in

116
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:28,799
Sister Yuan

117
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,720
What happened?

118
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,080
Say it

119
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,440
Say it

120
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:41,519
We just got the latest notice

121
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,480
It's about...

122
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,639
What notice?

123
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:58,120
The board's decision is as follows

124
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,840
All staff in the sales department will be sorted into two teams

125
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:06,919
Yuan Huizhong will be team A's leader

126
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,480
Li Siyu will be team B's leader

127
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,919
It's a two-way selection between team leader and members

128
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:16,911
Appointed team leaders will be voluntary

129
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,679
Sister Yuan, I go back to work now

130
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:48,000
Where's president Pan?

131
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,360
He is out for a meeting

132
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,759
When will he come back?

133
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,799
No idea

134
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:53,360
You can call him if necessary

135
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:05,250
I really do not know why it becomes like this

136
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,200
You told president Pan that you didn't want to be the team leader?

137
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,200
You are doubting me?

138
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,840
I don't want to

139
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,360
But the fact is here

140
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:23,750
The fact is, I said, I don't want to be the team leader

141
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,159
If you don't believe it

142
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:28,000
we confront him after he comes back

143
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:29,679
Siyu

144
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:31,240
Siyu

145
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,639
We have known each other for seven years

146
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:45,799
I see you as an apprentice and subordinate

147
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,879
I even see you as BFF and sister

148
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,200
I treat you with sincerity

149
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,360
You also treat me without reservations

150
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,000
Indeed

151
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,360
I shouldn't have doubted you

152
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,480
I really didn't...

153
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,320
Don't say anything

154
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,080
I believe you

155
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,519
Since president Pan trusts you

156
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,279
you should be the team leader

157
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:13,399
Sister Yuan

158
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:16,679
I am serious

159
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,360
President Pan has made the decision

160
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:23,240
We should do as he says

161
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,799
President Pan is so insighful

162
00:12:29,775 --> 00:12:32,320
You have the potential to be the director of sales department

163
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,480
But you are the most suitable candidate

164
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:42,080
Sister Yuan, don't worry

165
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,440
I'll be second to you

166
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:46,759
I didn't see you wrong

167
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,159
Don't worry

168
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,900
After I become the director, I will protect you

169
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,440
Go

170
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,279
Look, is sister Yuan angry?

171
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:11,440
They have turned against each other, right?

172
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:15,960
They are hugging

173
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,480
Come

174
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,900
To our dear Yiming

175
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:20,799
Come...

176
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:21,440
Come, cheers

177
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,480
Come, cheers

178
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:26,159
Brother

179
00:13:26,575 --> 00:13:27,695
What's your next plan?

180
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,799
I will have some holidays

181
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:33,175
Then I will try to find if there is any suitable job

182
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:37,960
So many companies want to poach him

183
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,600
Many companies are lining up, right?

184
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:42,279
They line up to the Bund

185
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:43,240
More than that

186
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,960
They crammed the elevated freeway

187
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,840
Enough

188
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,360
Yiming

189
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,720
Do you remember?

190
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,240
Tang

191
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,080
Who?

192
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:54,879
President Tang

193
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:56,840
The boss in Tongli?

194
00:13:57,425 --> 00:13:59,559
His company needs a planning director

195
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:00,919
They want to knwo if you are interested

196
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:02,960
Forget it

197
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,725
They offer a better wage and treatment

198
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:08,200
Yes, he can

199
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:10,519
Yes, we can make an appointment next time

200
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:11,200
Forget it

201
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:12,720
It's a good offer

202
00:14:13,725 --> 00:14:16,519
Not interested?

203
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:17,360
You two...

204
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,960
I resigned from Caijin

205
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,799
At least, I need to go to a better company than Caijin

206
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:24,799
Yes

207
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,000
Haowen

208
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:27,879
What are you talking?

209
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:29,080
Say it louder

210
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,240
Yes, what are you muttering?

211
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:33,156
Tang of Tongli company, do you know?

212
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,039
Yes...

213
00:14:35,275 --> 00:14:39,080
He begs Yiming to be the planning director in his company

214
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:40,240
Stop it

215
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,679
He won't go

216
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:43,120
Yeah, he doesn't give a damn

217
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:43,799
Yes

218
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:44,519
Of course

219
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,360
Tang's company is so low

220
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,080
Totally agree

221
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,399
Caijin is such a small pond for Yiming

222
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:50,960
Right?

223
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:55,532
He deserves a better salary and position in the next company

224
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,840
Right? -Of course

225
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,519
Of course

226
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:00,440
Big brother

227
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:03,519
If you find a better one,

228
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:04,919
don't forget us

229
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:05,519
Yeah

230
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,519
Big brother, as long as you need, we will go to work for you

231
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:09,840
Yes...

232
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,625
Yes

233
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:11,919
And you?

234
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:13,559
Yes

235
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:14,759
Come...

236
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:17,440
I will remember all of you if I find a better job

237
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,399
Ok?

238
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:19,360
Ok

239
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,720
We will follow big brother forever

240
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:32,240
The appointment is at four o'clock, right?

241
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:34,120
Yes

242
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,120
Now it's fifteen past four

243
00:15:35,575 --> 00:15:37,600
She wants to cheat?

244
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:40,360
Maybe

245
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,000
Sorry...

246
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,120
I have been here for a while

247
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,325
I talk to the machinist and forgot the time

248
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,919
President Wang, you are here too

249
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:55,720
Lanke

250
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,825
I just talked to the machinist

251
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,519
Very enlightening

252
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,440
The loss assessment

253
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,080
This is Mr. Lan's loss assessment

254
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:10,320
Ok, let's have a look at Lan's loss assessment

255
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,840
Here

256
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:20,960
Here

257
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:21,919
Here

258
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,399
Here and here

259
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:27,120
I won't be responsible for these

260
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,320
What do you mean?

261
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:36,200
These have nothing to do with the accident

262
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:37,919
You have repaired it before

263
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,039
So I won't pay for it

264
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,399
And this...

265
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:44,399
Just change the parts

266
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,399
No need to change the whole

267
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,279
And this

268
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,725
Hardware aging is not my business

269
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,799
Lanke, I will repair the car

270
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,480
You can't make me bankrupt, right?

271
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,960
Who told you not to replace these?

272
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,799
Zhong, Zeng, and Liang

273
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:13,319
The top three here

274
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,359
Well, Libi

275
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:20,119
Call Zhong, Zeng and Liang here

276
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,160
Ok

277
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,331
Your bag is 90% new at most

278
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,960
It's very expensive now

279
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:30,759
That's in the specialty store

280
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,000
This is a second-hand store

281
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,279
It's a signature style

282
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,200
22,000

283
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:38,480
It's out of stock all over the country

284
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,480
25,000

285
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,519
It's the hardest color to buy

286
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:52,680
25,000

287
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:54,240
Can't be less than this

288
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,960
Let me see

289
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,160
Be gentle

290
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,500
Mates

291
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:10,825
You told this lady, no need to change these parts?

292
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:14,480
She is familiar with this industry

293
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,559
So we told her the truth

294
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,799
You are friends, right?

295
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:24,279
None of their business

296
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,839
I made up an identity

297
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:27,960
So I got all the truth out

298
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,400
I can understand

299
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:35,440
Your 4S stores have to make money

300
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:38,000
But you should make money in a reasonable way

301
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,575
I will only take my responsibility

302
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:45,000
So what's the end?

303
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:49,240
Go back

304
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,920
Ok, go

305
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:54,640
Mr. Lan, I think

306
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:58,950
She is right

307
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,400
Ok, just do as she said

308
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:07,599
Ok

309
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:11,000
At least it can save more than 70,000

310
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,400
And I am your VIP and I put some money in it

311
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:16,559
I will have 20% discount

312
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,799
At least it can save more than 10,000

313
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,200
What's your job?

314
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,519
I'm a saleswoman

315
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:31,480
Which company?

316
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,200
Lubao

317
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:35,920
New energy battery company?

318
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,720
You know?

319
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,359
I have heard about it

320
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:41,119
President Wang

321
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,279
You can call me if you need battery

322
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:43,119
I can give you a discount

323
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:44,720
Let's talk about the car first

324
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,640
Ok

325
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:51,720
President Wang

326
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:54,279
Your car needs to change the parts

327
00:19:57,119 --> 00:19:59,240
Because they are imported

328
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:01,950
All the parts need to be shipped from Germany

329
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I want to discuss with you

330
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,279
Can you choose my friend's channel?

331
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:08,960
He can give me a lower price

332
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:10,880
Don't worry about quality

333
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:12,119
I can guarantee it

334
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:13,839
I don't need you to repair my car

335
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:15,720
You don't need to pay the money

336
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,000
I don't think it's ok

337
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,880
It's my responsibility

338
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,400
You just need to pay his bill

339
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:25,480
I have insurance

340
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:33,025
Well, then you will have no discount for the insurance next year

341
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,480
Li Siyu, right?

342
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,359
We can be WeChat friends

343
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:40,720
Ok

344
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,960
Then I won't call you president Wang

345
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:52,119
I will call you sister Ziru

346
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,839
You are my friend now

347
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,440
Siyu, you are quite capable

348
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:02,759
All because of money, I have no option

349
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:05,925
But not everyone can be like you

350
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:18,920
Sign here

351
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,079
I'll pay you

352
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:22,799
Give me some time

353
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,160
The matter of car is settled

354
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,359
See you at the old place

355
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:38,970
On second thought

356
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:42,160
Sister, what's wrong?

357
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:43,720
Sister

358
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,279
Sister, we can have a talk

359
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,319
I have reduced it to around a hundred thousand yuan

360
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,000
I am so awesome

361
00:21:52,839 --> 00:21:55,000
You have saved so much money

362
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:56,960
It's enough for Yuwei to finish all her education

363
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,960
from primary school to college

364
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:01,240
Thanks to sister Ziru's generosity

365
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:02,960
Thanks to her richness

366
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,559
Now you know why I need a rich boyfriend, right?

367
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:07,799
We can't be benevolent until we become rich

368
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,925
May I ask where your rich boyfriend is?

369
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,799
He is looking for me

370
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,359
Keep an eye on him and don't sprain your ankle

371
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:25,750
You have paid 130,000?

372
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,599
Here

373
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:36,880
What do you mean?

374
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:39,839
It's all because of me

375
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,160
But Chen Yiming started all this with the proposal

376
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,559
We should split up for 13,000

377
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:46,680
Do you have money?

378
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,519
No

379
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:48,880
So I mortgage the bag to pay you

380
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,759
I will redeem it after I get enough money

381
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:53,720
Be careful

382
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,519
I can't afford it

383
00:22:56,519 --> 00:22:57,279
Keep it for yourself

384
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,400
Ok, I will keep it for you first

385
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,759
But before I redeem it,

386
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:05,880
the ownership of the bag is yours

387
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:07,359
Zhizhi is the witness

388
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,359
Sister Siyu

389
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,957
If you really need, I have some money

390
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,279
No need

391
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,600
Leave Liu Yang's bonus to Yuwei

392
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:21,079
But to be honest

393
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:24,875
Brother Yiming is so great that he helps you with compensation

394
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:26,519
Don't hesitate anymore

395
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,319
Just say yes when he makes proposal next time

396
00:23:29,319 --> 00:23:30,119
Yes

397
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:31,319
Let me tell you

398
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:34,947
Now or never

399
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,960
Yiming is so great to me, I know

400
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:43,880
But I feel I am controlled

401
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,640
I have a lot to do

402
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,680
I'm afraid of losing freedom

403
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:49,759
Freedom?

404
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,119
Just because you want freedom

405
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:54,960
he wants to marry you earlier in case you love someone else

406
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,440
What?

407
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,720
You have to associate with your clients

408
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,920
What should he think of you?

409
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:03,440
The sweet and handsome man like Chen Yiming is the rigid demand

410
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,559
You need to cherish him

411
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,759
Zhizhi, just leave her alone

412
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:09,975
Once Chen Yiming dumps her, she will regret

413
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:19,700
Yiming

414
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:21,519
I'm so sorry

415
00:24:21,975 --> 00:24:24,039
Two years ago, my company was expanding very quickly

416
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:26,200
I was thirsty for talents

417
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:30,319
But now the market has changed a lot

418
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:32,920
What change?

419
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:34,240
Tell you the truth

420
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:39,375
80% of the companies I opened years ago began to close

421
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,599
I'm still downsizing

422
00:24:44,475 --> 00:24:47,200
I am sorry

423
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,640
It's ok, president Zhu, I can understand

424
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,839
How about this?

425
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:53,850
I will keep your resume

426
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:58,268
in case my friend's company may hire you

427
00:24:58,839 --> 00:24:59,440
Ok

428
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,125
As for my company

429
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:03,440
I have to say sorry

430
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,950
Thank you, president Zhu

431
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,920
I have to go now

432
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,480
President Zhu, we should have lunch together

433
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,839
It's lunch time

434
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:14,240
I have work to do

435
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,480
I have ordered the dishes

436
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,960
I can go to urge them...

437
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,960
No need...

438
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,575
I know it's hard to book a seat here

439
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:25,359
How about this?

440
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,725
Invite me next time if I find a new job for you

441
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,240
I feel guilty if I have lunch with you today

442
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,440
Goodbye

443
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:38,400
Goodbye

444
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,440
Ok

445
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,440
I have done my work

446
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:12,599
Where should we meet?

447
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:27,119
Yinmi Fanhua restaurant

448
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,680
Come here directly

449
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,000
I'm here

450
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:38,720
Miaomiao's mom, how are you?

451
00:26:38,759 --> 00:26:39,720
Come so early

452
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,480
I am free today

453
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,279
You are so beautiful today

454
00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:42,839
They are here too

455
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:43,680
It's ok

456
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,640
Hello

457
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,319
Here you are

458
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:47,599
Hello, Yuwei's mom

459
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:48,160
Linda's mom

460
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,400
You are here so early

461
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:51,039
I made some cookies for you

462
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,640
Xingxing likes matcha

463
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,200
Here

464
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,279
Ok, thanks  -For Xingxing

465
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,200
William likes chocolate

466
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:01,000
Linda likes little bear

467
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,920
I have bear's mold

468
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,279
Thank you

469
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:07,960
Miaomiao's mom

470
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,640
You are losing weight

471
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,160
So the sugar-free for you

472
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:11,759
Here

473
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,480
Thank you

474
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:15,920
You are so kind

475
00:27:16,119 --> 00:27:16,799
See

476
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:19,480
The little bear is so cute

477
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:22,400
This is Yuwei's father, right?

478
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:23,920
Nice to meet you

479
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,640
Hello

480
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,480
Hello

481
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:27,400
Miaomiao's mom

482
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,039
He is also from Chiao Tung University

483
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,680
He and Miaomiao's mom are alumni

484
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:35,920
I am a 2004 graduate

485
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:38,359
How about she?

486
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,799
My mom graduates from Cornell University 

487
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,559
Sorry

488
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:50,240
But my grandpa graduates from Chiao Tung University

489
00:27:51,875 --> 00:27:54,319
So can I ask, what's his major?

490
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,759
He is not a student

491
00:27:56,119 --> 00:27:57,079
He is a member of the board

492
00:27:58,559 --> 00:27:59,319
His reputation precedes him

493
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:01,571
You barely know his name

494
00:28:01,571 --> 00:28:03,571
How can you say reputation precedes him?

495
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:13,163
Well, I can't arrange the scene alone

496
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:14,640
That party?

497
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,599
What's it?

498
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:21,160
We will throw a party, I love mom, next month

499
00:28:21,319 --> 00:28:22,000
Ok

500
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,400
We want to make the party chic

501
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,519
But we are short of hands

502
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,039
I can help you

503
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:27,720
Really?

504
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,359
So great

505
00:28:29,675 --> 00:28:31,559
We still need to discuss about it

506
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,400
Discuss about it

507
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,519
Ok...

508
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,200
Ok, we will discuss about it

509
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,640
They are coming

510
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,839
Coming

511
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:47,920
Where is Miaomiao?

512
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:04,599
Miaomiao's mother adds me again

513
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,640
I am back in the elite group

514
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,640
We will have a meeting tomorrow night

515
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:11,240
Discuss about party

516
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:13,079
You can't be so excited, ok?

517
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:20,150
She took full responsibility and paid with her insurance?

518
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:21,400
Yes

519
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:22,920
No

520
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:24,680
Why not?

521
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,880
You have promised her

522
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,039
you would take full responsibility

523
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:29,680
You should keep your promise

524
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:34,720
Sister Ziru offered the help

525
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,960
I can't decline it

526
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:42,675
So you feel it's ok that she will cover all 

527
00:29:42,675 --> 00:29:45,160
the insurance loss and fraud risk of next year?

528
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:54,960
We are not her relatives

529
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:58,850
You think it's ok that we owe her such a big debt?

530
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,680
So much money

531
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:05,050
I need to sell a lot of batteries to pay the cost

532
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:11,400
Siyu

533
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:18,440
I have told you, I will pay it

534
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,725
Your money doesn't come so easily

535
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,839
It's all because of your hard work

536
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,440
But at least I won't feel guilty

537
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:46,160
So much money

538
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:59,200
We should pay more attention to the technologies of the battery

539
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,039
Excuse me

540
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,319
Hello

541
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,799
Sister Ziru, are you free tomorrow?

542
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,240
What's wrong, Siyu?

543
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:12,400
I want to invite you a meal

544
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:15,900
I will pay the repair cost

545
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:17,839
Ok, I will go

546
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,880
But we won't talk about repairing the car

547
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,240
Are you free tomorrow?

548
00:31:22,759 --> 00:31:23,480
Ok

549
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,319
Send me the address later

550
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,039
Ok, see you tomorrow

551
00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:35,039
Your annual salary is not much

552
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,850
How can you say you can earn it back in one year?

553
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:40,279
Because I'm amazing

554
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,599
I...

555
00:31:44,275 --> 00:31:47,550
I will make the company give me a pay rise

556
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,960
Wish you a promotion and a pay rise

557
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:55,960
Thank you

558
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,720
Go with me tomorrow

559
00:32:05,079 --> 00:32:05,839
Ok

560
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:34,275
She have said, she would be the second to me

561
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,799
People can breach the contract

562
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,200
Not to mention it's a verbal promise

563
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,119
Li Siyu, she won't

564
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,720
Then I ask you

565
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:49,839
Today you asked her to sort out the team

566
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:50,960
Why she rejected it?

567
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:56,720
I'll be second to you

568
00:32:58,559 --> 00:32:59,319
Sit

569
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,039
Siyu, look at this

570
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:06,920
This is personnel list of our sales department

571
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,680
You should choose some of them

572
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,559
Choose?

573
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,750
You are the team leader, you need to select some people

574
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,750
In addition to Xia Xiaotian and Liu Xiaojia

575
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:18,200
what about others?

576
00:33:22,075 --> 00:33:25,119
These are working with me all along

577
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:26,400
I need them

578
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,880
This...

579
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,599
Sister Yuan

580
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:30,680
The company said, it's two-way selection

581
00:33:31,375 --> 00:33:33,319
We can't select them here, right?

582
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,920
Let them choose

583
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,160
It will be so messy

584
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:40,511
In case they all choose my team or your team

585
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,400
First of all, they won't choose me

586
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:45,880
Besides, first come, first served

587
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,160
As long as you have enough staff

588
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,440
no one can enter if he wants to

589
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,559
Morning, president Pan

590
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:04,720
Morning, president Pan

591
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,599
Morning, president Pan

592
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:06,160
Morning

593
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:16,159
Sister Siyu, good morning

594
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:16,719
Morning

595
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:17,639
Morning

596
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,079
Sister

597
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,506
Lin Ling asks, if we are short of hands

598
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:26,320
She wants to join us

599
00:34:27,518 --> 00:34:28,319
Lin Ling

600
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:30,280
That three-egg goddess?

601
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:30,920
Yes

602
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:32,519
Sister Yuan let her go, right?

603
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:33,280
Yes

604
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:34,920
Sister Yuan says, those who have no sales performance

605
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,965
 for three consecutive months need to go

606
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:39,033
But now the sales department has changed

607
00:34:39,518 --> 00:34:44,174
I think if you keep her, she can work here for another 3 months

608
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,800
Forget it

609
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,679
She can't do anything

610
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:51,639
Why do I need her?

611
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:53,400
Ok

612
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,440
I'll go tell her

613
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,000
Ok

614
00:34:55,574 --> 00:34:58,440
Well, HR department has prepared the new office for you

615
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,119
Over there

616
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,900
Really?

617
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,679
Sister Siyu, morning

618
00:35:06,039 --> 00:35:06,639
Morning

619
00:35:17,559 --> 00:35:18,199
How's it?

620
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:33,800
Sister Siyu 

621
00:35:34,039 --> 00:35:36,875
They have said, you can tell them if you need some adjustment

622
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:38,760
Ok

623
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:41,599
Sister Yuan is here

624
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:42,880
I have to go now

625
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:46,320
Sister Yuan

626
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,079
Sister Yuan

627
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,800
How's it?  Everything is ready?

628
00:35:56,199 --> 00:35:57,639
Tell me if you need anything

629
00:35:57,639 --> 00:35:58,480
I have all you need

630
00:35:58,679 --> 00:35:59,320
No need

631
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:01,000
HR department did all for me

632
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:02,440
Are you feeling better?

633
00:36:02,679 --> 00:36:03,440
Much better

634
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,239
Do you need an infusion today?

635
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:06,760
I'll go with you after work

636
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,639
No need

637
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,725
I'll go to the hospital for the checkup later

638
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:14,519
But I have a client in Ningbo

639
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,880
He needs me to talk about the contract

640
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:19,119
So can you go to see him for me?

641
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,639
This is the last step

642
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,920
I only trust you

643
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,239
No problem, leave it to me

644
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,719
I will sign the contract for you

645
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:26,880
Thank you

646
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,239
I told Ziting to book the ten o'clock bus

647
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:30,159
Ok

648
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:33,840
What else?

649
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:35,840
Nothing

650
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,719
I have to go now

651
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:39,440
Ok

652
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:50,525
Our Lubao battery is the best on the market

653
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,480
Look

654
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,840
We just brought one...

655
00:38:11,559 --> 00:38:14,880
After you graduate, you only work in one company Caijin?

656
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,000
Yeah, I am kind of nostalgic

657
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,079
Mr. Chen

658
00:38:21,159 --> 00:38:22,280
You are Haowen's friend

659
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,760
Well, you are kind of my friend

660
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:25,360
I'll tell the truth

661
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:25,960
Ok

662
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:29,975
The best time for job-hopping is 3 or 5 years

663
00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:32,199
Your time is a bit too long

664
00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:34,360
No job-hopping for ten years

665
00:38:34,775 --> 00:38:36,480
I can't recommend you to my clients

666
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:37,800
It's not what they want

667
00:38:41,025 --> 00:38:43,519
The enterprises need highly loyal employees, right?

668
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:47,199
Loyalty is very important

669
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:49,519
The yearly job-hoppers are out of option

670
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:52,960
But corporate development needs dynamic talents

671
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,960
In addition to working years

672
00:39:00,725 --> 00:39:02,239
What about other aspects?

673
00:39:02,575 --> 00:39:06,725
The most sought-after talents are young and innovative

674
00:39:07,075 --> 00:39:09,519
Or they can bring resources to the company

675
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,450
Generally, it's directors

676
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:17,975
Given your age and previous position

677
00:39:17,975 --> 00:39:21,480
it's a little embarrassing

678
00:39:23,719 --> 00:39:24,559
No offense

679
00:39:24,679 --> 00:39:25,960
I'm a bit straightforward

680
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:26,639
It's ok

681
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:33,600
I just want to say, the salary may be not as high as you think

682
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:40,307
Then you think how much my salary should be?

683
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:45,480
200,000?

684
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,119
Annual salary?

685
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:47,800
Correct

686
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,199
Far from what I expected

687
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,360
Now this is the fact

688
00:40:18,519 --> 00:40:19,239
Hello

689
00:40:19,239 --> 00:40:19,920
Yiming

690
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,599
Hurry, congratulate me

691
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:22,840
What happened?

692
00:40:23,199 --> 00:40:24,199
I got another order

693
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:26,440
Great

694
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,239
Congratulations

695
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,039
You are not in the company?

696
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:31,800
I am now

697
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:34,880
Your company plays the coquettish background music?

698
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,159
I'm in a cafe near the company

699
00:40:37,159 --> 00:40:39,275
An appointment with my client

700
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,000
You won't work overtime tonight, right?

701
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,239
Don't forget

702
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:43,719
We will have dinner with sister Ziru tonight

703
00:40:44,199 --> 00:40:45,480
I am going to the high-speed rail station now

704
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,119
I will arrive in Shanghai this afternoon

705
00:40:48,425 --> 00:40:50,559
Then go to the company, that's all

706
00:40:53,559 --> 00:40:54,440
You are on a business trip again?

707
00:40:56,119 --> 00:40:56,880
I'm in Ningbo

708
00:40:58,725 --> 00:41:01,280
As I know, you don't have a client in Ningbo

709
00:41:02,199 --> 00:41:03,360
Sister Yuan's client

710
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,239
I am here to help her

711
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,079
Sister Yuan needs your help?

712
00:41:09,079 --> 00:41:10,199
She has something else

713
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,800
Why are you silent?

714
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,719
Nothing

715
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,199
What nothing?

716
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,639
You want to blame me that I didn't tell you in advance again?

717
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:33,880
No

718
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,440
Don't be angry

719
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:40,039
It's a temporary arrangement

720
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:41,440
I didn't have the time to tell you

721
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:42,920
Come and go in a few hours

722
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,400
It's ok

723
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,599
Fine

724
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:46,960
Bye

725
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,199
Sister Siyu

726
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,000
Sister Siyu, Vice President Hu wants to see you

727
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,440
In HR department

728
00:42:15,239 --> 00:42:15,760
Ok

729
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:16,800
Leave it to me

730
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,440
Thank you

731
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:17,880
Ok

732
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:19,280
Thank you

733
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,039
Come in

734
00:42:32,559 --> 00:42:33,239
Sit

735
00:42:35,559 --> 00:42:37,450
You need to select your staff

736
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:38,559
Me?

737
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,639
It's a two-way choice, right?

738
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:42,239
Check the list first

739
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,039
Is this the entire sales department?

740
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,119
No

741
00:42:51,675 --> 00:42:53,280
Sister Yuan has finished her selection

742
00:42:55,719 --> 00:42:58,559
So these are leftovers

743
00:42:58,880 --> 00:42:59,599
Correct

744
00:43:00,425 --> 00:43:01,905
What else can I select?

745
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,360
Mr. Hu, I have to go now

746
00:43:20,199 --> 00:43:21,159
Show me this

747
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:27,440
Come in

748
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:29,559
Sister

749
00:43:29,679 --> 00:43:31,039
Here's team A's list

750
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,800
Huang Bibo, Kuaizi, Afu

751
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:34,599
Zhou Zhiyu, Yang Tian

752
00:43:34,599 --> 00:43:35,400
And Zhang Jiaqi

753
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,039
I get it

754
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,639
As I know, after we went out today

755
00:43:43,159 --> 00:43:45,775
sister Yuan talked to them in office one by one

756
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:49,280
And she let them sign to follow her

757
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,000
Really?

758
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:53,360
So now except you

759
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:56,575
top ten salesmen go to her team

760
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,480
Show me that

761
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:06,975
Sister, she did this on purpose?
