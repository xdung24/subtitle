# Google translate version for your reference #

2
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,200
Come

3
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:41,239
Your meal

4
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,159
it is good

5
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:52,120
Please enjoy

6
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:52,799
Ok thank you

7
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:00,879
Drink some wine

8
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:02,040
Ok

9
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,239
Actually I still have good wine in my car

10
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,080
Didn't drive today

11
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,800
Your wine

12
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,000
on

13
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,360
Pretty expensive

14
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,759
I think this barbecue stall

15
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:18,719
Got it

16
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:21,360
You still know wine

17
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:24,520
My friend told me

18
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,639
Say that wine

19
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,400
You can't buy it with money

20
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:30,960
Actually I don't know alcohol

21
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,520
But sometimes

22
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:34,000
If you don't understand, you have to pretend to understand

23
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,599
Come on

24
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:44,000
Just that

25
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,240
The boss who sells my wine

26
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,560
Later I sold a bottle

27
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,360
More expensive wine

28
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:48,879
After i bought it

29
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,240
I forgot where to put it

30
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,120
what is it call

31
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:55,039
Romandy Romance

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,159
I also checked on Baidu

33
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:57,960
Never remembered

34
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,080
Sister Ziru, you

35
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,159
Really

36
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,439
Pretty straightforward

37
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,280
Am i honest

38
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:13,680
Yes this

39
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,000
This is my true feeling

40
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,159
Many people say me

41
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,680
Black belly

42
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,280
Say i have a plan

43
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,439
Say I'm cruel

44
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:27,240
But in my eyes

45
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,360
you're a

46
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:29,639
Very wise

47
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:31,840
Calm and rational

48
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:33,159
firm

49
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:35,360
From the bone

50
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,400
Exudes kindness

51
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,400
Such a

52
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,240
A female

53
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,039
Such a high rating

54
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:43,159
Yes

55
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,840
Am i calm

56
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,759
Yes

57
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,280
But i'm here with you

58
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,240
Messed up

59
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:12,560
Yiming

60
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:14,280
Actually I have a secret

61
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,120
That day

62
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,600
I didn't see any customers

63
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:25,120
I didn't forget

64
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,199
Our date

65
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:28,800
I'm in the office

66
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:31,639
Every call you make

67
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:33,439
Every WeChat you send me

68
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,720
Actually, actually I

69
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,800
I saw it all

70
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,480
Sister Ru Ziru, you

71
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,279
Why are you

72
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:40,639
I

73
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,160
I dare not come to see you

74
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,600
I'm afraid of me

75
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,279
Can't control myself

76
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:53,959
I have to use

77
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:54,920
Tens of minutes

78
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,959
Come to calm down

79
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,680
I can calm down

80
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,240
Pick you up

81
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,639
Sister Ziru

82
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:03,920
Yiming

83
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,000
I

84
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:06,639
I seem

85
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:10,120
Like you

86
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:29,079
Yiming, i know

87
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,000
This shouldn't

88
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:33,160
do not know

89
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,439
How come you feel this way

90
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:35,800
In what way

91
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,519
Neither should

92
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:49,399
Sister Ziru

93
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:50,360
Yiming me

94
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:53,720
I

95
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,439
No more demands on you

96
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,160
This is me personally

97
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:03,000
A one-sided emotion

98
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:04,519
Me too

99
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,519
Don't need your return

100
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:08,319
Don't need your response

101
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,160
I don't want to bring you

102
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:15,120
Any burden

103
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:20,480
No, sister Ziru, I

104
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,720
How am I?

105
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,439
Yiming

106
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,439
Look at me today

107
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:30,560
Have the courage to ask you out

108
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:33,240
Because of me

109
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:37,160
I figured it out

110
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,000
This is my unilateral emotion

111
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,360
I told it today

112
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:49,839
Not the beginning

113
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,560
Is the end

114
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,000
After today is over

115
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,439
I won't mention it again

116
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,360
I might later

117
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,560
Will continue to love you

118
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,600
Will love deeply

119
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:12,920
but I

120
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:15,279
Won't let you know again

121
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,319
Sister Ziru

122
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,519
Yiming

123
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:52,560
rest assured

124
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:54,959
I won't treat you

125
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:56,120
More demanding

126
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,279
We will

127
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:00,800
Still friends

128
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,600
still is

129
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:03,920
Sister and brother

130
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,160
Confidant

131
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,240
Drank this glass of wine

132
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:17,800
This matter is over

133
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:22,360
Annie

134
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,159
President Wang

135
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:28,080
You go take a look

136
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,120
What is Chen Yiming's status now

137
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:31,519
Mr. Chen came early in the morning

138
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,120
is it

139
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,360
He also handed this

140
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:00,519
He said nothing else

141
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,399
Said nothing

142
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,519
What about people now

143
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,399
No longer in the company

144
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:16,320
Shouldn't

145
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:24,039
Go out

146
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:50,879
Annie

147
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,799
You go find someone for me to find a way

148
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:03,519
Inquire about Chen Yiming's whereabouts

149
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:04,399
as well as

150
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,279
All his future trends

151
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,480
Ok

152
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,279
Have you reported

153
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,039
Not reported this month

154
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,399
My bill this month

155
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:51,360
Handed in for a week

156
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:52,159
Not approved yet

157
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,279
Don't mention it

158
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:56,080
My online promotion fee

159
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,960
It's been half a month and haven't approved

160
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:00,320
Our company

161
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,639
There won't be any problems, right

162
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,919
Probably

163
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,879
Don’t believe in rumors

164
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,879
What does it mean

165
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,159
This is on the company account

166
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:23,200
Current balance

167
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,399
This is the employee salary for this month

168
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:30,480
And various expenses

169
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,559
This is what we should have long ago

170
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:35,480
Paid for

171
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,279
Arrears to all parties

172
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:43,559
Recently talked about

173
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:44,639
Dozens of franchisees

174
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:46,120
As long as the formal contract

175
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,279
There will be a deposit

176
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,600
I did

177
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,080
Can last a month at most

178
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,720
Unless you can guarantee

179
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,480
Every month

180
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,840
Ten thousand paid new users

181
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,799
And for two consecutive years

182
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,440
Internet is to burn money

183
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:04,000
Don't burn for three years and five years

184
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,279
Surely no effect

185
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:11,879
Only you and I know this

186
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,000
I'll find Mr. Pan again

187
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,679
There is only this way

188
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,840
You help me prepare

189
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,840
All financial statements

190
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,480
I happened to report to him

191
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:23,960
Ok then i'll pass

192
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:55,240
President Pan, when will you be free?

193
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:57,120
I want to report to you

194
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,600
The latest development of the call

195
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:07,399
Problems

196
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:12,279
Is our company out of money?

197
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,559
What did you say

198
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,840
We have plenty of cash flow

199
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,080
Investors have money

200
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:19,279
I see on our account

201
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,720
Only forty-three yuan left

202
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:23,840
How did you know

203
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,519
I hacked Fan's computer

204
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,600
Guan Xiaotang

205
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,879
You're getting old again

206
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,679
What did you promise me

207
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,679
Scared to death

208
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:35,639
You wait for me to finish

209
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:36,600
Can you call again

210
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:40,480
Say

211
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,240
Do you want to carry it alone

212
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:44,039
I am the boss

213
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:45,240
I don't carry anyone

214
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:47,679
You wait

215
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,279
What are you doing

216
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,360
I asked you why

217
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,519
What do you mean

218
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,080
From now on

219
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,360
I don't receive salary

220
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:08,279
Voluntary labor

221
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,919
Saving endangered companies

222
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:14,039
What do you eat and drink

223
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,320
What to pay the rent

224
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:18,600
I live with my friend

225
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,720
Can eat and drink

226
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:21,879
You can also rub the net

227
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,919
now it's right

228
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:36,960

230
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:41,440
Thanks for your kindness

231
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:43,279
But your salary

232
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,440
Can't be less

233
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,360
If you dare to refuse

234
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:47,600
Or return

235
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,000
You go now

236
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,720
Is not

237
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,679
You are taking me as an outsider

238
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:52,480
Am i an outsider

239
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,759
There is nothing

240
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,519
Insider outsider

241
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:55,480
All employees

242
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,039
Quickly collect the money

243
00:16:57,919 --> 00:16:59,279
Don't force me to fire you

244
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,680
I'm out of town waiting for my return

245
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:37,799

250
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,039
What is so mysterious

251
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,000
You just said that the internet promotion fee

252
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,039
I haven't approved it for you?

253
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:56,920
Yes

254
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,680

255
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,720
twelve thousand

256
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:03,039
Why are you asking this

257
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:06,839
Look at the phone

258
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:11,079
This is not in line with the financial procedures

259
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,119
It's okay, this fits

260
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,160

Didn't we say that the end of the year is good?

365
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,039
Recent prices

366
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:33,319
Isn't it lowered?

367
00:23:34,119 --> 00:23:36,000
Your third cousin is going to buy a house

368
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,839
You say i'm a mother

369
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:40,119

379
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:47,000
Can make me earn immediately

380
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:47,759

00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:16,119
Ready to go

400
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,240
By the way, how is Mr. Luo?

401
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:20,599
Already discharged

402
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,680
This disease comes quickly

403
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,599
Go fast

404
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,920
how do you know

405
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:28,480
He is allergic to peanuts

406
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,319
My daughter is also allergic to peanuts

407
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,240
So the pastries outside

408
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,519
I didn't dare to buy her

409
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,920
I am at home

410
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,880
Make it for her

411
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,640
That one

412
00:26:45,799 --> 00:26:47,039
Thanks to you today

413
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,519
If this manager Luo

414
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,440
Something happened in our company

415
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:54,480
Then we

416
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:56,200
It's all over

417
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:01,720
that

418
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,119
President Yuan

419
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,440
I want to ask you a question

420
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,480
You said

421
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,720
That one

422
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,480
Mr. Su from Qijue Company

423
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,759
I already

424
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:16,319
Visited him nine times

425
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:17,880
Every time I get kicked out

426
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:19,480
I just want to ask

427
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,200
I face such customers

428
00:27:21,799 --> 00:27:23,400
How should I communicate with him

429
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,720
I was just trying to tell you

430
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:26,839
You don't need to follow this Su

431
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,920
Then you said

432
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,480
He wants to place an order

433
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,720
For your own related customers

434
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:33,119
So always resist us

435
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:34,119
Customers like this

436
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:35,640
We generally give up

437
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:39,000
Then I will

438
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,400
So you wait

439
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:48,319
See you tomorrow

440
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:49,279
This customer

441
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:50,519
He likes table tennis

442
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:52,440
There happened to be an international competition recently

443
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:54,279
Buy a coupon and send it to him

444
00:27:58,559 --> 00:27:59,519
Thank you Mr. Yuan

445
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,039
You can go back sooner if it's okay

446
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,240
Zhizhi

447
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,079
Let me help you

448
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:51,960
Thank you

449
00:28:56,839 --> 00:28:57,680
Why is this so much

450
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,119
Frozen food and instant noodles

451
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:00,240
Bought for my son

452
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,680
how old is he

453
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,640
First grade

454
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:04,640
It's the long body

455
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,119
Don't you eat these?

456
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,119
It's better than eating takeaway every day, right?

457
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:11,160
Is there no one at home to take care of him?

458
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,480
Our home

459
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,680
Just me and my son

460
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:17,960
It's not easy for you

461
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,640
I have to work hard and bring my son

462
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:22,440
No one is easy

463
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:23,960
Where do you live, let me see you off

464
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:24,920
no need

465
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,400
You go back and take care of your son

466
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,240
I will help you put in the car

467
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:27,799
it is good

468
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:40,279
see you tomorrow

469
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:41,079
see you tomorrow

470
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:20,640
Lei Haowen and Chen Yiming

471
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,599
Have resigned

472
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,119
They both made one together

473
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:24,160
Self-media company

474
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,839
He also started a business

475
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,799
You said

476
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,599
Will you two make up?

477
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,880
The same entrepreneurs

478
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,519
Met and met

479
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,240
impossible

480
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,720
I'm serious

481
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:47,559
How about you two

482
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:49,160
Because you wanted to start a business

483
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,000
Just broke up

484
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,839
Now he has started his own business

485
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,559
maybe

486
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:53,640
He can understand you

487
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,200
I went to take a bath

488
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,400
Hello dad

489
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,799
Yiming, what's the matter

490
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,079
Your cousin today

491
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:14,359
Come to our house for money

492
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:15,640
Say you from her

493
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,599
Borrowed one hundred thousand yuan

494
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:18,960
Said if you don't pay it right away

495
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:20,440
Your third cousin's house

496
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,400
But it's so hot

497
00:32:21,799 --> 00:32:22,759
No house

498
00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:24,279
Your third cousin can't get married

499
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,400
This is a big deal

500
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,440
I heard that you are with the fourth brother

501
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,400
Also borrowed 100,000

502
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,160
Didn't I buy a house?

503
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:34,079
I can't turn around now

504
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,519
Haven't you all taken out a loan?

505
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:40,680
Yiming, are you sick?

506
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,279
No mom

507
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,799
You and Mom must tell the truth

508
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:46,960
Did you have an accident

509
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:50,279
Mom, I'm fine

510
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:50,960
Really okay

511
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:53,400
How about siyu

512
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:56,920
Not bad

513
00:32:58,039 --> 00:32:59,039
What about you

514
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:00,400
Suddenly asking for so much money

515
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,480
What's your use

516
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,000
Ma, I really bought a house

517
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:08,000
What did your cousin say about the money

518
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,599
Yiming

519
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,319
You wanted the six hundred thousand last time

520
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:12,720
200,000 of them

521
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,319
I am still

522
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:14,400
Borrowed from an old classmate

523
00:33:15,079 --> 00:33:16,319
Your cousin is 100,000

524
00:33:16,759 --> 00:33:18,359
We really can't help you

525
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:22,160
Dad mom

526
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:23,759
Don't worry about this

527
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,240
I find a solution by myself

528
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:26,880
I'll hang up first

529
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:15,639
uncle

530
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,400
Siyu, let me ask you something

531
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,320
You must tell me the truth

532
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,039
You say

533
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,159
What happened to Yiming?

534
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,400
I do not know

535
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,239
Why don't you know

536
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:32,719
I really do not know

537
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,559
He in recent months

538
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:37,400
Before and after

539
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,679
Borrowed more than seven hundred thousand

540
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,199
We have broken up

541
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:45,320
When did it happen

542
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,039
Months ago

543
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,159
why

544
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:49,360
Haven't you already bought a house

545
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,199
Are you getting married

546
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:52,639
Uncle, I still have something

547
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:53,800
I'm going to hang up first

548
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,760
He is not necessarily amazing

549
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,639
This name

550
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:15,920
On five or six platforms

551
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,320
Registered your own public number

552
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,639
Talk about financial brands

553
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,719
Although the topic is relatively small

554
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,000
But the response was good

555
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,159
Now his number of fans

556
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:25,000
And reading

557
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,119
Are growing steadily

558
00:35:27,239 --> 00:35:28,199
How is the income

559
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,639
His current main income

560
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:31,840
Rely on manuscript fees and rewards

561
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,760
Several platforms added together

562
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,239
It's about two to three thousand in total

563
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:38,840
OK, you go out

564
00:35:39,559 --> 00:35:40,280
Ok

565
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:51,480
Hello, auntie

566
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,800
I transferred you five thousand yuan first

567
00:35:54,679 --> 00:35:55,440
How many

568
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,079
Isn't it 100,000?

569
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,719
Why has it become five thousand

570
00:36:02,199 --> 00:36:05,239
My remaining ninety-five thousand

571
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,000
I couldn't make it all at once

572
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:08,920
Can you first

573
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,039
Give me a few more days

574
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:11,239
Row

575
00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:12,280
The end of the month

576
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:13,760
Can't delay a day

577
00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:16,280
Ok thank you cousin

578
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,119
what happened

579
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,119
Hao Wen

580
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:44,920
Before the end of our month

581
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:47,400
Can you get an ad

582
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,119
Don't worry, no problem

583
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:54,559
OK, that's it first

584
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:56,920
Ok

585
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:57,880
Bye bye

586
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,320
Hello there

587
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:01,920
What to do

588
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,639
Continue water

589
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:05,519
No thanks

590
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,679
you are welcome

591
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:55,360
thank you

592
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,679
Your car now

593
00:38:48,679 --> 00:38:49,519
Has been discontinued

594
00:38:49,639 --> 00:38:50,639
Can't sell the price now

595
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,400
You should keep it for yourself

596
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:55,039
Just speak directly

597
00:38:55,559 --> 00:38:56,320
How much can i give

598
00:38:56,519 --> 00:38:57,159
fifty thousand

599
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:58,320
fifty thousand

600
00:38:58,519 --> 00:39:00,519
Consider yourself

601
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,039
Hey

602
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:16,639
Where are you

603
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,199
I sell a car

604
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:20,719
Why are you selling cars

605
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:26,320
I'm not a relative in my hometown

606
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:27,840
Is the debt collection tight?

607
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:29,000
I can pay it back

608
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:29,960
Just pay back a little

609
00:39:30,199 --> 00:39:31,079
Did you sell it?

610
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:32,119
not yet

611
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,239
You sell it to me

612
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,400
I give you 300,000

613
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,280
What are you kidding

614
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,840
I am busy now

615
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:14,239
Do you dare to mention a word of thanks

616
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:15,519
We are not brothers

617
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,239
I didn't plan to say thank you

618
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,599
Give you the car key

619
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,880
I look down on your broken car

620
00:40:24,199 --> 00:40:25,199
Keep it alone

621
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,199
I still have something urgent

622
00:40:26,199 --> 00:40:27,039
See you later

623
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,079
Lei Haowen

624
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:29,719
I went to meet a client

625
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:30,760
See you later

626
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:15,400
Hello dad

627
00:41:16,519 --> 00:41:17,880
I will transfer you 300,000 immediately

628
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:18,400
Let's put

629
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,599
Relatives and friends paid back

630
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,360
I'll turn right away

631
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,440
I'll transfer after I hang up

632
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:24,119
Ok

633
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,760
Good good okay

634
00:41:27,079 --> 00:41:27,599
Ok

635
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:28,760
it is good

636
00:41:29,679 --> 00:41:30,360
Bye bye

637
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:51,960
Teacher Yiming

638
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,239
The weather has changed recently

639
00:41:53,559 --> 00:41:54,800
Please pay attention to the body

640
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:39,320
Wait

641
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:48,239
Please enjoy

642
00:42:57,559 --> 00:42:58,480
I heard

643
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,960
Recently on a new movie

644
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:00,719
Quite good looking

645
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,639
Shall we go to see after dinner

646
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,199
As planned

647
00:43:04,559 --> 00:43:05,960
After dinner today

648
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,400
Let's go to the bookstore first

649
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:09,480
Sit for an hour

650
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,039
Then go to the lake

651
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:12,760
Walk for thirty minutes

652
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,320
Can't it be changed

653
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,000
Can't

654
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,599
By the way, I almost forgot

655
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:48,639
what is this

656
00:43:48,639 --> 00:43:50,000
This is since we met

657
00:43:50,039 --> 00:43:50,960
all

658
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,239
WeChat QQ SMS

659
00:43:53,239 --> 00:43:54,880
And communication data analysis chart

660
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:55,679
This this

661
00:43:55,679 --> 00:43:57,599
What's the use of this stuff?

662
00:44:00,039 --> 00:44:01,360
There are

663
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:03,800
Word count ratio Article count ratio

664
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,159
Response time ratio

665
00:44:05,199 --> 00:44:06,679
Histogram of total time

666
00:44:09,039 --> 00:44:10,719
It can be seen from these graphics

667
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:11,760
Our communication

668
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,280
It can be said to be relatively smooth

669
00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:15,639
Also have a certain understanding of each other

670
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:18,320
Oh

671
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,440
After data analysis,

672
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:26,400
I think our relationship

673
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,639
Can be upgraded again

674
00:44:28,679 --> 00:44:29,480
I recommend

675
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:31,960
While walking tonight

676
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:33,840
We can do some

677
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,440
More intimate physical contact

678
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:36,719
Like kissing

679
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:44,559
that

680
00:44:45,039 --> 00:44:46,679
Kissing pose

681
00:44:46,679 --> 00:44:47,760
do you have any requests

682
00:44:50,719 --> 00:44:51,800
This one

683
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:54,159
I think casual is better
