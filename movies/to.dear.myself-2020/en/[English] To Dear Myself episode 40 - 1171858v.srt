00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
[Episode 40]

4
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,400
Xiaoling, you've changed.

5
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,600
I figured something out.

6
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,000
Although I can't change him, I can change myself.

7
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,200
As long as I don't pursuit perfection, he is the perfect one.

8
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,400
That makes sense.

9
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,100
CEO Wang.

10
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,200
- I poured water for you. 
 - Okay. Okay. Okay.

11
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,800
- Chinese medicine. 
 - Tomorrow, I will send the contract over to you.

12
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,000
Okay.

13
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,000
She is like the previous you more and more.

14
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,610
Everyone is changing.

15
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,000
Only you're the one going in circles.

16
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,400
Why do you say this?

17
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,400
Nowadays, when dating, who cares about the age gap?

18
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,800
Look at others. Too many people.

19
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,600
You are talking about Guan Xiaotang?

20
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,000
Yes!

21
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,600
Look at him. He's generous, sweet, and easy-going.

22
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,800
He is also good looking.

23
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,600
He is even considerate. He bought nuts for you to supplement extra nutrition for you.

24
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,600
You rejected him! You are even using it.

25
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,200
First, that is called "not using things."

26
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,000
Second, I rejected him is not because of his age.

27
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,600
Then why?

28
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,000
He is not the one.

29
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,800
Who do you want?

30
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,000
You still want Chen Yiming?

31
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,800
Xiaoling.

32
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,400
It's okay. She mentioned him just now.

33
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,000
It's okay. I recovered already.

34
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,100
That's good.

35
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,000
It's really in the past?

36
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,000
The business goes up and down.

37
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,800
So do relationships.

38
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,500
Life goes up and down.

39
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,400
Everything happens for a reason.

40
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,200
The point is what to do next.

41
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,200
What do you plan to do?

42
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,800
Keep on.

43
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,200
Keep on being myself.

44
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,000
I need to leave first.

45
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,400
Sister Siyu, I will treat you a meal next time.

46
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,200
Take it. Eat it on the way.

47
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,400
You are too busy to even drink water.

48
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,100
I don't have enough time.

49
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,800
Before you were like this.

50
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,500
You were like the previous Zhizhi more and more.

51
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,600
Seize the moment?

52
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,360
Parenting book?

53
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,700
You even read parenting books?

54
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,200
To get prepared.

55
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,100
Why?

56
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,600
No why.

57
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,400
I don't agree.

58
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,600
I'm asking for your opinion.

59
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,000
I'm informing you.

60
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,500
But you should have a reason, right?

61
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,000
It's normal for a company to reduce its staff.

62
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,600
Even if the company needs to reduce staff, she is not the one you should reduce!

63
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,200
She pointed out to fire her.

64
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,200
Who is she?

65
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,570
President Wang?

66
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,400
Why? Why does she do this to Zhizhi?

67
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,400
I don't know.

68
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,600
Since this woman came to Lubao, shit happens one after another.

69
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,800
Huizhong...

70
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,000
You are afraid of her. I'm not. She can fire me as well.

71
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,700
Huizhong!

72
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,600
You put on the number? It'll be easy to put them in the other place.

73
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,600
This one. Remember to handle gently.

74
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,600
I get it, Brother.

75
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,200
- Brother Yang. 
 - You came back!

76
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,600
I have been back for a few days.

77
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,400
Hey...

78
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,800
No need. Are you moving?

79
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,200
Yes. Because we have had no breakthrough in the laboratory,

80
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,800
the school wanted Professor Gao to change his research direction.

81
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,800
Professor Gao didn't agree so he quit.

82
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,400
Then your experiment?

83
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,400
Professor Gao sold the house to continue. But now all the money has been used up.

84
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,800
The school hopes that we can empty the lab.

85
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,800
So we have to move out.

86
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,000
How about you?

87
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,600
Me? I will move with Professor Gao for sure.

88
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,800
Brother Yang, sorry.

89
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,800
It was all my fault. If it was not me,

90
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,800
you wouldn't have lost your job.

91
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,200
No need to apologize.

92
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,800
I'm doing well now.

93
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,400
But Zhizhi and you have come to this point.

94
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,000
It's nothing to do with you.

95
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,200
It was all my own fault.

96
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,600
Brother Yang,

97
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,200
I came here today to apologize to you first.

98
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,200
Second, I want to restart work for my old industry.

99
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,000
So I came to consult you about

100
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,400
the latest trend in the battery industry.

101
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,000
If talking about this topic,

102
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,800
you should ask Professor Gao. He has a more comprehensive idea than me.

103
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,200
But you know him. Sometimes he thinks differently than others.

104
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,800
I want to listen to different ideas.

105
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,770
Siyu?

106
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,180
President Wang.

107
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,700
You didn't change. You are the same as before.

108
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:13,100
I think you are also like before.

109
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,800
Is Professor Gao here?

110
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,200
I want to see him.

111
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,600
Go inside, please.

112
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,800
Wait a minute. Excuse me.

113
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,600
Can't go.

114
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I can't get through.

115
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,800
You said two days! It has been three days now!

116
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,000
It's been so long! You haven't finished!

117
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,600
Excuse me. We have been moving, soit's a bit messy.

118
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,600
Take a seat, please.

119
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,400
Professor Gao.

120
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,800
Professor Gao.

121
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,000
What's up? Say it quickly.

122
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:05,390
If you don't talk, then leave quickly.

123
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,700
I'm annoyed now.

124
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,800
I came here to meet you. Do you remember?

125
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,100
I remember. You want to buy 60% of my shares with ¥20,000,000.

126
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,220
Your memory is really good.

127
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,400
How much do you plan to offer this time?

128
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,000
Ten million.

129
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Less than last time.

130
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:37,190
Professor Gao, time changes.

131
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,000
Two years ago, many people looked to further increase their knowledge in membrane-less batteries.

132
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,400
But now,

133
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,600
even your university stopped the project.

134
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,200
It means that not many people are thinking positively about this project.

135
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,400
It's not promising.

136
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,400
It's my biggest sincerity to offer ¥10,000,000.

137
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:57,400
Since it's not promising, why did you come here?

138
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,000
I admire you!

139
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,500
Don't!

140
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,400
If you really admired me,

141
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,300
you should offer 500 million.

142
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,200
Professor Gao, if the money is mine,

143
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,400
there is no problem for me to offer 500 million.

144
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,000
But it's the shareholders' money.

145
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,800
I can't spend it freely.

146
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,600
Professor Gao, I know.

147
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,400
You have spent all your money on this project.

148
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,800
Now you are moving the lab.

149
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,700
Is it because you can't afford the rent?

150
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,800
Is it your business?

151
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,100
Are you hardhearted enough to waste

152
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,500
all your previous efforts?

153
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,300
Professor Gao, as long as you sign,

154
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:53,600
¥10,000,000 will be sent to you right away. You can continue researching.

155
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,900
Liu Yang, walk the guest out.

156
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,400
Professor Gao, I'm offering timely help.

157
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:03,000
President Wang, you were never a person offering timely help.

158
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You are good at looting a burning house.

159
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:15,400
Siyu, do you have some misunderstanding with me?

160
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,000
Misunderstanding?

161
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,400
Others probably. It's difficult for me to

162
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,200
misunderstand you.

163
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,400
I understand.

164
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:29,600
You don't feel happy about Yiming and I.

165
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,200
Chen Yiming has nothing to do with me.

166
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,600
You and Chen Yiming has nothing to do with me, either.

167
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,000
Oh...

168
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:41,580
You have problem with me because of Lubao?

169
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,800
Siyu, it's like this.

170
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,400
People have different identities.

171
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,000
Take me as an example. I am your friend.

172
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,800
But I'm also Lubao's chairman of the board and general manager. I have to be responsible for all the shareholders—

173
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,800
Stop.

174
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,800
If you were me, you would do exactly the same.

175
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,000
I wouldn't.

176
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,800
Why are you still here?

177
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,260
Siyu,

178
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,200
let me teach you one lesson.

179
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,200
Offering timely help and looting a burning house

180
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,000
are the same thing with different perspectives.

181
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,200
I will teach you today what is "offering timely help."

182
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:32,740
Professor Gao,

183
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:36,100
I'm donating all my property to your lab.

184
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,580
Without any extra conditions.

185
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,190
Are you feeling wronged and acting rashly with me?

186
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:48,190
Yes! I want to grab your limelight!

187
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:51,160
You should change your impulsive problem.

188
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,380
I can't change it for my whole life.

189
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:01,070
Siyu, I tell you out of my utmost kindness.

190
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:03,830
If you want to compare with me, you are not even close.

191
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:07,180
Your money is even not enough for their pocket money.

192
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:10,830
You want to invest? You want to steal my limelight?

193
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:15,850
You keep it to save your life. You will pay for your impulsiveness.

194
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:17,850
I'm not afraid.

195
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:25,860
Are you done?

196
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:30,300
Professor Gao, it seems today is not a good time.

197
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:35,040
Let's talk another day without miscellaneous freeloaders.

198
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,720
Sorry for not walking you out.

199
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,990
Who are you?

200
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:48,400
I'm Li Siyu.

201
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,950
I'm Liu Yang's friend.

202
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:52,060
Hi.

203
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,580
I listened to your lecture before.

204
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:56,640
Yes?

205
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,950
You really want to donate the money to my lab?

206
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:09,400
I've said this and I took out the card.

207
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,260
Can I still take it back?

208
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,100
Oh my.

209
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,600
Thank you.

210
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,660
It's great. I really appreciate it.

211
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:23,050
That's great!

212
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:25,820
How much is it?

213
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,370
More than ¥50,000.

214
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,560
Thank you.

215
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,430
It's not even enough for the electricity bill.

216
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:42,800
How much do you need?

217
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,840
¥5,000,000.

218
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:01,710
Professor Gao, why didn't you say yes to Wang Ziru?

219
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:05,560
She wants to spend ¥10,000,000 to buy 60% of my shares.

220
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:09,660
She was insulting my research and IQ.

221
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:14,630
The ¥5,000,000 you said means?

222
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:18,400
I've found the breakthrough.

223
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,750
As long as I have ¥5,000,000, within 1 year,

224
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,220
my battery will work.

225
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:31,490
Professor Gao, take this money to pay the electricity bill.

226
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:34,430
I will collect the rest of the ¥5,000,000.

227
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:45,000
What do you mean? Tell me what you want?

228
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,780
Professor Gao, do you know why your lab is driven into a corner?

229
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:52,140
You don't lack scientists. But you lack people like me

230
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:56,420
who knows the battery and business well.

231
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:01,130
From today on, I don't want your salary. I'm joining your team officially.

232
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:05,380
I'll collect the money for you and guarantee your experiment especially.

233
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,450
But the whole industry doesn't look to our further increase.

234
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:12,990
Wang Ziru came to buy you for the second time.

235
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:16,860
This woman won't do anything if it's not profitable.

236
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,820
She offers such a low price. It means that she knows it's very risky.

237
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:26,540
Didn't Professor Gao say he had found a breakthrough?

238
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:34,120
During the last 10 years, I found a breakthrough 127 times.

239
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,480
But I found that...

240
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,680
these breakthroughs are dead ends.

241
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:46,830
This time will probably be like this.

242
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,210
So what?

243
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:51,690
Maybe the ¥5,000,000 you collect will be down the drain.

244
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:57,110
I have experienced this. I don't fear this at all!

245
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:06,780
I will call you back later.

246
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,910
Zhizhi,

247
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:14,810
the HR has informed you?

248
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:21,850
Sister Yuan, am I really bad?

249
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:25,780
Zhizhi, you are very capable.

250
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:28,920
Also, you never dragged the sales department down.

251
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:34,020
I have been working in this industry for over ten years. I've trained so many people.

252
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:38,090
Your comprehension and capability are at the top 3.

253
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:41,120
Then why?

254
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,840
No one has been sacked. Only me.

255
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:51,700
It is said this was a direct order from the board.

256
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:55,010
The board?

257
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:56,720
President Wang.

258
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:11,790
Yiming,

259
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:13,870
- am I late? 
 - No, you are just on time.

260
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:15,980
Tell everyone, President Wang is here. Get ready.

261
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:19,570
President Wang, you need to accept two prizes today. One is the Top 10 Battery Company of the Year.

262
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:21,450
The other one is the Annual Trustworthy Product of the Client.

263
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:26,060
After you accept the prizes, there is a press conference. I invited around 30 reporters from different media agencies.

264
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,350
So many?

265
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:31,870
If you want me to increase Lubao's valuation, we must do this.

266
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:33,750
Give the marker to President Wang.

267
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,980
Take a photo.

268
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,210
Show me the photo.

269
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:44,470
Okay. It's good.

270
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:45,890
If I knew this, I would have asked President Fang to come.

271
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:48,550
President Fang is attending another forum. That's also very important.

272
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,350
Tell them the guest is ready.

273
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:52,480
The guest is ready.

274
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,500
Yiming,

275
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,470
I need to tell you something.

276
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:01,060
What's wrong?

277
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,180
I visited Gao Zhengdao.

278
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:06,110
Gao Zhengdao?

279
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:09,070
That battery expert who rebels against orthodoxy?

280
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:12,460
Yes. Guess who I met?

281
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:16,450
Liu Yang? He is professor Gao's student.

282
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:18,320
Oh, that's how they know each other?

283
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,230
Yes. You want to work with Professor Gao?

284
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:26,530
Yes. I wanted to buy his lab with a high price.

285
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:29,750
But I was rejected harshly.

286
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,570
Why?

287
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:34,130
Because of Li Siyu.

288
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:35,990
She came back?

289
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:41,690
Siyu has a deep prejudice with me.

290
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:44,150
Because of me?

291
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:52,860
How about this? I can ask Liu Yang to try to talk to Professor Gao.

292
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,750
Okay. Thank you.

293
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,060
No need.

294
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:59,140
It's the Party B's job to share the Party A's trouble.

295
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,050
The guest, prepare to enter.

296
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:02,270
Okay. Ready.

297
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:04,140
Yiming,

298
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:10,160
all of sudden, I'm a bit nervous.

299
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,260
Let me share my experience with you.

300
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:16,700
When you get nervous, think about some happy things, you can overcome it.

301
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,640
Really?

302
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,370
Let me think about it. What happiness do I have recently?

303
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,690
I love you.

304
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,250
Happy?

305
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:32,930
Very happy.

306
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:34,500
Let's go.

307
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:41,250
Open the door.

308
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:44,900
Let's welcome the award-winning guest, Miss Wang Ziru.

309
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:21,570
Say...

310
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:23,730
- It‘s because— 
 - Mom!

311
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:31,940
It's because I'm Sister Siyu's cousin so they fired me.

312
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,740
-This reason— 
 - It's nothing.

313
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:40,020
I worked in a company before. Because the staff's Chinese zodiac sign doesn't fit the boss's,

314
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,240
they fired him directly.

315
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:50,010
But I just got the hang of my job.

316
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:52,600
I need to start over again.

317
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:57,540
It maybe a good thing.

318
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:00,580
Good thing?

319
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:06,440
The company informed me they will send me to work in Europe for five years.

320
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,450
Five years?

321
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,250
When do you leave?

322
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,750
As quickly as next month.

323
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,590
Then it's just in a few days.

324
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:28,610
Yes.

325
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:37,790
Zhizhi,

326
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:43,880
I want to take you, Sushan and Yuwei to go together.

327
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:52,010
- Me and Yuwei? 
 - Yes. It's okay to take the family with me.

328
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:56,400
Also, the company will subsidize the family expenses every month.

329
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,120
The four of us will live happily in Europe.

330
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,280
- Well... 
 - I know.

331
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:07,160
To you, it may be difficult.

332
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,470
When I received the news,

333
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:14,740
I also didn't know what to do. I know you like your job.

334
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:20,520
I'm also not sure if you will give up your job for me.

335
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:25,000
But now it's a coincidence that it happened.

336
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,930
Maybe... it's destiny?

337
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,350
Destiny?

338
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:36,560
The heavens want us to be together.

339
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:43,720
It's okay. Don't think too much.

340
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,600
The ugly little duck walks out of the bushes and raises his wings

341
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:58,300
and quickly found out that its wings were full of power.

342
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,200
He flew to the central lake and looked at his reflection.

343
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,600
He was surprised to find that he was no longer that ugly duckling.

344
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,000
Instead, he became a beautiful swan.

345
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,500
The ugly duckling became a swan?

346
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:17,780
Okay, that's enough for today.

347
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,700
Tomorrow, we continue.

348
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,400
Go to sleep now.

349
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,200
Yuwei,

350
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,100
I want to ask you

351
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:35,400
would you be willing to study abroad?

352
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,200
Together with Sushan?

353
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,450
I am willing!

354
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,300
I know now.

355
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,000
Go to sleep.

356
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,500
Here.

357
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,100
You want me

358
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:10,600
to invest in Gao Zhengdao's membrane-less battery study?

359
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:19,300
Not unless my brain turned to liquid.

360
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:24,800
It's just ¥5,000,000. It's just a small sacrifice for you.

361
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,200
You still owe me ¥3,000,000 that you never returned!

362
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,900
So that's why I'm trying to make investments everywhere!

363
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:37,500
Li Siyu, if this was your own project, I could've taken it into consideration.

364
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:40,600
But Gao Zhengdao? No way am I investing.

365
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,200
Why not?

366
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:46,750
First of all,

367
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:51,000
I am a representative of membrane batteries.

368
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,400
I have always blatantly opposed membrane-less batteries.

369
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,000
Second,

370
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,800
Gao Zhengdao? Him?

371
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,400
He and I are absolutely incompatible.

372
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,800
Guan Zhong and Bao Shuya had their own masters.
 (T/N: Guan Zhong and Bao Shuya are politicians in ancient China.)

373
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:09,200
But they worked together and made a huge achievement in the end.

374
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,400
The thing he's researching

375
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:15,600
can't even be reach success in his own lab. How could it be successful in the big market?

376
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,000
Right now, he's on the brink of a breakthrough.

377
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,200
Every time he thinks he's seen one, it's just failure waiting for him.

378
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,200
GM Pan, just take a look.

379
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,800
I'm not going. His stupid lab?

380
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:33,400
I went ten years ago. Dirty, messy, crappy, and underdeveloped.

381
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:37,800
I said a few things with good intent, but then he scolded me fiercely.

382
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,600
Maybe now, he changed his views?

383
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,300
Gao Zhengdao?

384
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,800
He can't change.

385
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:48,400
GM Pan, you should see for yourself first. You can help me gatekeep.

386
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,000
I'm not going!

387
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:56,000
But it's not like you have anything to do anyway. Go out more.

388
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,400
Maybe it will help you with your revenge plan!

389
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,200
Professor Gao,

390
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:22,600
it's been ten years. I think you haven't really improved.

391
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:26,200
Even if I didn't improve at all, I've still always been ahead of you.

392
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,800
You designed round batteries?

393
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,800
Who am I?

394
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:47,000
These years, you've actually improved, no?

395
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:53,290
You've finally spoken a truth.

396
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,000
How about this?

397
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,600
I can invest ¥3,000,000 first. On round battery technology,

398
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,800
Let's try the solid—

399
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,800
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

400
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,200
You're talking about membrane batteries?

401
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,600
Of course.

402
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,300
This is the only way to solve Lubao 3's

403
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:16,600
bottleneck of energy density that we can't break through for a long time.

404
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,600
Do you think the research I've spent so long doing

405
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,700
was all in order to solve the inferior problems of your inferior products?

406
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,800
As long as we can change the quality of human life,

407
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,000
there's no such thing as superiority and inferiority. Understand?

408
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,400
You don't understand anything.

409
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,800
You two great masters.

410
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,800
You were talking civilly just a few minutes ago. How come you've started bickering?

411
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,400
Leave. You're not on my level.

412
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,200
Go, please.

413
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,200
Let me remind you...

414
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,400
that membrane-less batteries have no future.

415
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:50,800
You can research for 10 or 20 more years, but that doesn't change that fact.

416
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,100
Gao Zhengdao, all around you is darkness.

417
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,800
You cannot see beyond your nose.

418
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:58,400
If you have things to say, be proper. Let's not try to infuriate each other.

419
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:01,410
Gao Zhengdao,

420
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:07,360
as long as you are willing to change directions, I will invest immediately.

421
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,400
Liu Yang!

422
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,800
Let the dogs out!

423
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:17,000
You're so stubborn and foul-tempered.

424
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,800
Better than your stench of money!

425
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,000
GM Pan, GM Pan, don't go.

426
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,800
- Let him go! 
 - You guys should keep discussing.

427
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,090
I'm not going to collaborate with such people!

428
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:28,200
I'd rather work for a person like Wang Ziru

429
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,600
than work with a self-centered person like you!

430
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,400
GM Pan, we still have a proposal. We can keep talking about it.

431
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:36,600
Get out! Get out! Don't let me see him!

432
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,900
What kind of trash was that?

433
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,400
- Professor Gao. 
 - What's wrong?

434
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,600
¥3,000,000 went down the drain.

435
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,300
I'm not afraid!

436
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,400
After the battery is successfully invented,

437
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,400
the people who want to invest in us will be lined up all the way to the Oriental Pearl Tower!

438
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,800
But the situation right now is that we have no money!

439
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:03,000
The membrane-less battery will die on the vine!

440
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:11,600
Professor Gao, at this point, we're begging people right now.

441
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,400
We... can't you control your temper—

442
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,800
This is just my temper!

443
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:44,400
Next time... I'm not going to nose into the investment business.

444
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,590
Y-You can decide for yourself.

445
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,000
All right.

446
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,900
What? ¥5,000,000?

447
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,800
¥4,000,000 is fine, too.

448
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,200
¥3,000,000 could work too.

449
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:07,400
Of course, ¥6,000,000 would be best.

450
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:12,100
Sister Siyu, I trust you. The things you believe will definitely be successful,

451
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,900
but...

452
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,100
I really have no money. The most I could possbily take out is ¥50,000.

453
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:22,200
Don't you understand that none of us have money?

454
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,400
I'm not saying you guys should take that money out.

455
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:28,000
I'm saying the people around you can.

456
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,100
Thank you guys.

457
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:48,300
Zhizhi! What is this?

458
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,200
Zhizhi, you accepted him?

459
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,800
Zhizhi,

460
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:10,800
if you were still a saleswoman at Lubao,

461
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:15,200
would you have accepted his proposal and go to Europe with him?

462
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:23,230
I don't know.

463
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,100
I'm sorry.

464
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,200
Sister Siyu, don't say that.

465
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,600
It's true that I was kicked out because of our relationship,

466
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:41,000
but that also means that my value in the company wasn't high enough.

467
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
If I could've become irreplaceable,

468
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,600
then the company wouldn't have fired me so easily.

469
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:52,000
No, Zhizhi, as a saleswoman, you're already so talented.

470
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,800
Then I'll have to thank you even more.

471
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:58,200
If it weren't for you, I never would've known that I could be a saleswoman at all!

472
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:02,000
I also wouldn't have known that I had this much potential.

473
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,200
But right now, you're giving all of this up?

474
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,000
Why can't you think of the things Zhizhi gained?

475
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,400
She got a steady, kind husband,

476
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,400
a peaceful life, and a stable family.

477
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,000
These are things you cannot buy!

478
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,400
I just don't want history to repeat itself.

479
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,300
What do you mean?

480
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,800
Sister Siyu is trying to say that before Liu Yang did all of that stuff,

481
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:28,800
I also had a peaceful and steady family life, too.

482
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,800
People are different from each other!

483
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:34,200
Liu Yang and that Su- Su whatever are not the same person.

484
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:38,200
You and her are different as well! She was born to be combative.

485
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,600
Don't you forget

486
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,400
Zhizhi said that before meeting clients, her heart would beat rapidly.

487
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:47,200
What does this mean? This means that clients are her lovers.

488
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,400
Business is her love!

489
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:54,200
Zhizhi even put on the ring. She picked it herself!

490
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,200
What are you doing?

491
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,400
- She picked it herself! 
 - You two, that's enough. Stop fussing.

492
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:03,400
Stop! Stop fussing!

493
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,400
- Stop fussing. 
 - Stop fussing.

494
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,000
Stop fussing. I'm telling you to stop.

495
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,800
¥5,000,000?

496
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,400
Originally, I hadn't wanted to bring this up to you,

497
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,300
but she is my only sister.

498
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:28,800
Did you bring the project startup proposal?

499
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,500
T-T-T-he what now?

500
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:38,900
Just briefly explain the strengths of this project.

501
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,400
This project has so much potential.

502
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,800
You also know that new energy—

503
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,000
No matter how much potential the project has,

504
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,200
but not all the companies in this industry are good.

505
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:56,200
My older sister worked as a saleswoman in Lubao for ten years.

506
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,800
She has the sales resources and channels.

507
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,400
You mixed the concepts again.

508
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,800
Being a good salesperson and R&D are two very different things.

509
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,000
Besides,

510
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,800
no matter how good a salesperson is, that doesn't mean that they'd be a good CEO.

511
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,000
How about I invite her to come and talk to you?

512
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,500
I do not see the necessity. According to your analysis just now,

513
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:19,600
your sister prefers high risk. Right?

514
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:23,300
She is the type of person who cares too much about one thing, am I wrong?

515
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,800
Aren't all of you business creators like this?

516
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,900
Wrong.

517
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:29,400
The most important thing in business-making is the desire to survive,

518
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,300
meaning that the company has to keep existing.

519
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:39,600
Then... Then if you aren't investing,

520
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:43,200
can you start by taking into consideration that she will be your family member,

521
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,600
and help her by letting her borrow some money?

522
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,800
Right now, we are not legally married,

523
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:53,600
so I cannot use our family relationship to help her.

524
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:57,400
Then, what if it was me who wanted money to borrow?

525
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,800
In the prenuptial agreement I gave you,

526
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,000
the first page,

527
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,400
part two, clause seven states that before marriage,

528
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:11,000
I do not have any obligation to give you any money.

529
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,200
Page five,

530
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:16,000
part three has a clause that says that after marriage,

531
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,400
according to the time length of our marriage and the cost to take care of you,

532
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,800
you will receive a cash payment that is proportional to it,

533
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,200
and this payment

534
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,800
is the money that you are allowed to use.

535
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,000
So your point is that you won't let me borrow money from you.

536
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,200
So we need to sign the prenuptial agreement before marriage.

537
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,400
Then we can know the duties and rights of each other.

538
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,800
This will be easier and more clear

539
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:45,400
to prevent unnecessary disputes currently or in the future.

540
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,200
I get it.

541
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,000
Can we order?

542
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,300
Sushan!

543
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,400
Daddy, I want to eat ice cream.

544
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,800
I'll get you some.

545
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,400
Wow.

546
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,980
You want mango-flavored?

547
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,400
The thing I talked to you over WeChat about, have you considered it yet?

548
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,000
What thing?

549
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,800
My cousin's thing.

550
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,700
Your cousin's project?

551
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:27,400
If it was you who needed help...

552
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:30,200
Be careful. I would not hesitate to help you,

553
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:35,000
But if you want me to let your cousin borrow my money...

554
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I think... it's not proper.

555
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,300
Why not?

556
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:44,800
This project is too risky. If something bad happened,

557
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,600
first, it would affect your relationship with your cousin,

558
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,500
and second,

559
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:53,030
our relationship will go through trouble as well.

560
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,400
But my cousin is determined to do this project and I want to help her.

561
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,200
Then tell her to quit while she can.

562
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,200
Look, with her experience, she can go to a big company

563
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,400
and become a high executive. Isn't that good for everyone?

564
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,400
Why suffer so much?

565
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,000
But she just got out of a big company and doesn't want to go back.

566
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,100
At the very least, even if she succeeds in setting up a company,

567
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:20,900
as a woman, do you think she's happy?

568
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,200
It's not certain.

569
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,800
I'm talking about the highest probability.

570
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,000
Think about it, out of all the women with successful careers,

571
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,000
part of them do not have good marriage lives.

572
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:38,000
So, she should find a stable place to work

573
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,800
and a suitable man to marry. That's should be the way.

574
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,700
Then you think that in the end, all women should deal with the household?

575
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:53,910
Well, we cannot generalize it that way.

576
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,200
Then tell me about it.

577
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,400
If, in the house,

578
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:03,600
there is not enough money, it's unrealistic to talk about "household."

579
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:11,010
What if the family makes a high income?

580
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,800
If the family makes a high income...

581
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,400
then I think that if one person could stay at home all the time, wouldn't that be nice?

582
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,700
Each one performs his/her own functions.

583
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,700
Here, Sushan.

584
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:34,120
- Come out, okay? 
 - Okay.

585
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,000
The ice cream is ready.

586
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,600
The ice cream is ready!

587
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:41,000
Come, let's come up.

588
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,700
Our ice cream is here.

589
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:50,600
Thank you, Older Sister.

590
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,800
- Thank you, Older Sister. 
 - No problem.

591
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,200
- Say bye to older sister. 
 - Bye, Older Sister.

592
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,600
- Bye-bye. 
 - Let's go.

593
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,600
Daddy, you eat.

594
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,600
I'll take a bite.

595
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,800
Thank you, precious.

596
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,800
Look at the bubbles.

597
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,600
Did you see?

598
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:15,200
Here. One, two, three.

599
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,600
Yuwei.

600
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,000
Can I ask you something?

601
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,800
Of course.

602
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:25,700
Recently, have there been any men coming to find your mom?

603
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,200
No.

604
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,000
No?

605
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,200
Do you like coming out to play with me?

606
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,800
Yes.

607
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:37,600
Then, do you like coming out to play with mom and dad together?

608
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,000
I like that, too!

609
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,600
Then you need to learn to make requests, okay?

610
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,600
In the future, when you come out with mom, invite me too!

611
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,000
Okay. Then next time when we hang out with Sushan

612
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,600
and Sushan's dad, you can also join us.

613
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:56,600
Who is Sushan's dad?

614
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,800
He's Sushan's dad, of course.

615
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:04,100
Then... what about Sushan's mom?

616
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,800
I've never seen her, but one time, Sushan told me that

617
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,000
her dad asked if she was willing

618
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
to let my mom be her mom.

619
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,800
Sushan said she was!

620
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,100
Then, Sushan and her dad are always hanging out with you?

621
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,600
Sushan is my best friend.

622
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,200
We play together every week,

623
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:35,800
and we are going to go to Europe to go to elementary school together!

624
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,200
Who said that you were going to do that?

625
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,600
Sushan said so. Sushan's dad said

626
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,900
that he will bring me and mom to Europe.

627
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,800
Did they say when?

628
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,600
I don't know either, but it's soon.

629
00:41:57,170 --> 00:42:00,210
Dad, take another bite.

630
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,600
Did you finish reading the prenuptial agreement?

631
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:31,520
Not yet.

632
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,400
It shouldn't take this long.

633
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:41,400
Normal people can read 200-400 characters in a minute.

634
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:44,300
People who read quickly can even go up to 600 characters.

635
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:47,600
Even if you were the slowest reader,

636
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:51,800
if you read for 30 minutes a day, you would've finished in ten days.

637
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,800
So?

638
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,800
Do you have dyslexia?

639
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,800
No.

640
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:06,000
I'm just a slow reader, and I have been since I was little.

641
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,300
Besides, I need to think while reading.

642
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,200
Fine.

643
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,400
I'll give you thirty more days.

644
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,700
Thirty days later, we step into the next procedure.

645
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:22,800
Fine.

646
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,800
I hope we can start the wedding procedure this year.

647
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:33,000
If we waste too much time on the prenuptial agreement...

648
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,100
He Mu, do you love me?

649
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,600
Why are you laughing?

650
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:48,800
I really don't understand

651
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,600
why females need to hear direct answers

652
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:55,600
right from the other person's mouth for confirmation.

653
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,300
I don't understand.

654
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:06,000
This might be the difference in thought processes between males and females.

655
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,800
It might be because of the difference in these thoughts

656
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:12,300
so human beings keep being curious about marriage.

657
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,200
I feel unwell, I'm going home to rest.
