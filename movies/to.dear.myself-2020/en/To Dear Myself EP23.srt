[Ep23]

3
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:40,480
It's not so tidy, hope you won't mind

4
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,719
It's ok

5
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:45,000
I will clean it up later

6
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,359
No, I can do it myself

7
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:57,040
Let me help you

8
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:57,640
Come

9
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,319
Just sit here

10
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:26,479
Come, Yuwei, come

11
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,120
Wait

12
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:39,479
Wait a minute

13
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,599
Mom

14
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:48,520
Why dad hasn't come back yet?

15
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:50,919
Dad is on a business trip

16
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:52,840
He will come back soon

17
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:53,639
Oh

18
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:55,759
Brother Yang, come to eat

19
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:20,919
Sit

20
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:24,960
Yayun, thank you

21
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:27,639
No need

22
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,759
I am here to warm you up

23
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,080
Well

24
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:39,719
You will like it

25
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:47,520
Little potatoes

26
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:48,879
I made it for you

27
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:51,479
Yayun

28
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,000
You are so good to me

29
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,080
Brother Yang

30
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:57,319
I want to be nice to you forever

31
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,039
Hello

32
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,319
Hello

33
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:16,800
Do you need a loan?

34
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,920
No, thank you

35
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,480
Mom, I want to play with the phone

36
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:01,600
Only ten minutes

37
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:02,920
Ok

38
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:14,000
This is mom

39
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,399
This is me

40
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:16,800
This is dad

41
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:17,959
Mom

42
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:20,639
When will dad be back?

43
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,959
Hello, mom

44
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,360
It's me

45
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:55,959
Zhizhi

46
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:57,800
How are you doing?

47
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,000
Zhizhi

48
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,120
Can you hear me?

49
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:08,759
Mom

50
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:17,175
Liu Yang has an affair

51
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:20,800
His colleague Wei, right?

52
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:22,560
Mom, you know?

53
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,680
I need to talk to Yang

54
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,279
I will scold him

55
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,240
Mom

56
00:08:32,558 --> 00:08:33,918
He moved out

57
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,255
Yang is so ridiculous

58
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:41,600
Zhizhi, don't worry

59
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,519
I will stand on your side

60
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,879
He will break up with that woman

61
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:47,080
I will tell him to come home and apologize to you

62
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,759
Mom

63
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,000
You are so nice

64
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:59,175
Zhizhi, but I need to tell you

65
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:00,840
After he comes back,

66
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,759
don't quarrel with him

67
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:06,675
Otherwise, he will go to see that woman again

68
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,080
Did you hear me?

69
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,480
Ok, I will listen to you

70
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,759
That's all

71
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:21,919
Bye

72
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,720
You are stupid

73
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,475
If you lose Zhizhi, you will regret

74
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:41,559
I know how to handle it

75
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:43,720
If you don't do as I say

76
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,399
you are not my son

77
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:46,159
Mom

78
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,679
Today you need to go home

79
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:54,279
But Zhizhi

80
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:56,919
Yang, Zhizhi promised me

81
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,825
As long as you go home, it's over

82
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,919
She won't mention it

83
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:04,279
I need to think about it

84
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,519
Think about what?

85
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:07,279
Do as I say

86
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:07,799
Ok

87
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:09,360
I have to work now

88
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:46,919
Brother Yang

89
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,240
Don't push yourself so hard

90
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,960
Watch a movie tonight

91
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:22,679
Come

92
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,799
Great

93
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,279
I want to play...

94
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:26,200
I still want to play

95
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,799
Ok... Come...

96
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:29,840
Come...

97
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:31,360
Come up

98
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,200
I still want to play

99
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:36,120
One

100
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:38,840
I still want to play

101
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,080
Let's take a break

102
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,320
Your aunt is tired

103
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,360
I still want to play

104
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:44,399
Zhizhi

105
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,279
Yang, he wants to go home

106
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,759
He also said he was wrong

107
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:51,120
And he has promised he won't do it again

108
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,240
Really?

109
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:54,200
He told me in person

110
00:11:56,919 --> 00:12:01,159
But he didn't call me till now

111
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:02,240
No text

112
00:12:03,025 --> 00:12:06,600
It's all because of male chauvinist

113
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:11,650
Zhizhi, you should call him

114
00:12:12,025 --> 00:12:14,159
Or pick him up from the office

115
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:23,080
Tired?

116
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,320
Yes

117
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,960
So tiring to caretake a kid

118
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,039
Tough work

119
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:31,159
I'm tired too

120
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:34,320
You?

121
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:38,519
I need to fight against gravity and age

122
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:39,639
You think it's easy?

123
00:12:40,975 --> 00:12:44,200
So you think you can win the gravity and age?

124
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:46,000
I can't win

125
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,639
But I will fight to the last minute

126
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,279
Piss off

127
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,039
Piss off to you

128
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,159
What did she say?

129
00:13:17,825 --> 00:13:22,575
Can you help me find where Liu Yang lives now?

130
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,360
What do you want to do?

131
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,759
I want to give him an out

132
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,440
Did he confess?

133
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,759
He confessed to his mom

134
00:13:40,225 --> 00:13:44,559
And I also have some responsibility

135
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:48,080
Really forgive him?

136
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:53,759
For Yuwei

137
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,159
I am willing to forgive him

138
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:58,960
Fine

139
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,720
1. 2, 3

140
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:18,759
All right

141
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,000
How's it?

142
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,399
Great

143
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:24,080
What are you up to this weekend?

144
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,240
Gaze at you

145
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:28,320
We should have a meal with your parents

146
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,399
They need to go out on the weekend

147
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,919
Your spurned my last invitation because they went to Europe

148
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:37,000
Prior to that, they went to Thailand

149
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,039
Prior to that...

150
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:38,679
Xiaoling

151
00:14:39,025 --> 00:14:42,120
I think it's not the time

152
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,000
So when is the come?

153
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:45,960
You know what

154
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,720
According to the tradition of our family

155
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,720
Seeing parents means marriage

156
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,279
So you mean, you don't want to marry me?

157
00:14:54,725 --> 00:14:57,679
I think we are not old enough to get married

158
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,759
I see

159
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:03,159
Actually I enjoy the current status

160
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:04,919
We can enjoy the sweetness of love

161
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:06,360
without the trivialities of marriage

162
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,000
Then you are not afraid I will run away with someone else?

163
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,639
Yes

164
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:15,480
But I know

165
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,399
You won't

166
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:43,879
Coming

167
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,039
So fast?

168
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:47,639
I just placed the order

169
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:53,320
Coming

170
00:15:57,159 --> 00:15:58,320
Xiaoling

171
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,039
Wait a minute

172
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:03,639
Lei Haowen, what are you doing?

173
00:16:04,075 --> 00:16:05,720
You hide a man in the house?

174
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,720
I need to get changed

175
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,399
In a moment

176
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:09,639
Open the door

177
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,759
I am going to leave if you don't open the door now

178
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,240
I am coming...

179
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:23,240
Please come in

180
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,240
How do you know my house?

181
00:16:45,025 --> 00:16:46,519
So easy

182
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:50,519
Do me a favor

183
00:16:52,475 --> 00:16:54,200
You have said, you won't aske me 

184
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,775
for help even if you die, right?

185
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,440
Let me go

186
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,879
I was kidding

187
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:03,200
I am so happy to see you here

188
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,200
Sit...

189
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,799
Sit...

190
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:07,920
Come

191
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,680
Orange juice

192
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,680
Open it

193
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,000
You hurt me so deeply

194
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,839
I can't even talk about it?

195
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,759
Say it, what favor?

196
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:33,500
I can do everything for you as long as I can

197
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,680
Be my ex boyfriend

198
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,640
What?

199
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,960
Be my ex boyfriend

200
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,680
I am even not your boyfriend

201
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,079
Bloody ex-boyfriend

202
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,759
Will you help me?

203
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,119
Sorry, I can't

204
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:05,079
I want to be your current boyfriend, ok?

205
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,839
Current boyfriend

206
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:22,640
Be gentle...

207
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:26,160
Will you help me?

208
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:27,279
Be gentle...

209
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:28,440
Ok...

210
00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:31,359
You are so cruel

211
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:32,960
Remember

212
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:36,039
Do according to my plan strictly

213
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:38,240
What's your plan?

214
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:40,880
First

215
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,920
Drive your cabriolet

216
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:45,640
You need to figure out to use it first

217
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,240
Second

218
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:51,839
Make a proposal to me with a ring and a bouquet

219
00:18:52,759 --> 00:18:55,519
Then Wei Shang will be jealous

220
00:18:56,025 --> 00:18:58,400
Then he will stimulated to make a proposal to me

221
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:10,599
Understand?

222
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,119
Yes

223
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,880
We should set the time

224
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:19,319
Wait

225
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,880
I have to think about it

226
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,920
What?

227
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,640
The role is so important

228
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,240
I need to think about how to get into it

229
00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:29,240
Thank you

230
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:36,279
What are you looking at?

231
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:37,960
Nothing

232
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:39,960
The menu

233
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,640
What else do you want?

234
00:20:56,279 --> 00:20:58,200
Where are you? What's going on?

235
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,440
What you want to eat?

236
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:03,720
Immediately

237
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,279
Come to my face in five minutes

238
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:08,759
Otherwise, you need to disappear from my world in the future

239
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,240
Xiaoling

240
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:45,920
Xiaoling

241
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:48,240
He is calling you

242
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,240
Really?

243
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,000
Gu Xiaoling

244
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:03,720
Please

245
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:05,920
Give me one more chance

246
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:09,759
Lei Haowen, get up

247
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,079
I won't if you don't promise me

248
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:14,640
We have broken up

249
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,500
But I can't live without you Gu Xiaoling

250
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:21,839
Gu Xiaoling

251
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,839
Marry me, Gu Xiaoling

252
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:25,640
We can't be together

253
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,119
I have a boyfriend

254
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:28,920
It doesn't matter

255
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,000
As long as you are not married

256
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:33,400
I still have a chance, Xiaoling

257
00:22:34,175 --> 00:22:35,759
I can give you everything

258
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:38,125
I can buy you bags and lipsticks

259
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,319
And a big villa

260
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,720
I can give you whatever you want

261
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,000
Xiaoling, marry me

262
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:45,640
I can give you happiness, Xiaoling

263
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:48,640
This is my fiance

264
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:50,359
We are getting married soon

265
00:22:59,079 --> 00:22:59,960
Impossible

266
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:01,599
Xiaoling, impossible

267
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:02,880
It's your excuse, Xiaoling

268
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,440
Marry me, Xiaoling

269
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,119
Dude

270
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,799
Come, get up

271
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,160
You break taboos the moment you came in

272
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:26,920
Proposal is a big deal

273
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:29,200
Look at you, disheveled

274
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:31,000
Like a refugee

275
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:38,400
And the bouquet

276
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:42,759
Yeah, you spent some thougts on it

277
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:47,200
You need to get flowers tidy ok?

278
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:51,480
And your kneeling

279
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,480
It's a proposal, not new year call

280
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,839
You need to take a knee

281
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:57,799
And the most important...

282
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:01,500
At this moment, bags, lipsticks, 

283
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,475
villas and sports car are useless 

284
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,799
The most important is sincerity

285
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,640
Come, let me show you

286
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,160
Dear

287
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,000
Will you marry me?

288
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,039
I...

289
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:32,640
Got that?

290
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:34,759
You should be like this

291
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,680
Come, have a try

292
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,079
Me?

293
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:41,799
Take it, try

294
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,599
Come on

295
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:46,839
I will take a picture for you

296
00:24:47,125 --> 00:24:50,400
You can check it out and make some improvement

297
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,119
Ok...

298
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:03,599
Forget it

299
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,559
Xiaoling

300
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,160
It's not too late to propose

301
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:08,279
I am not ready this time

302
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:11,279
I will come again when I am ready

303
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:29,720
You are not angry at all?

304
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:32,880
Xiaoling

305
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:34,039
Sit down

306
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:37,240
Sit

307
00:25:41,475 --> 00:25:47,079
Men become at a loss only in front of his love

308
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,000
Xiaoling

309
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:53,319
My advice is, you should consider his request

310
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:55,640
What about us?

311
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,599
Us...

312
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,200
I like you very much

313
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:07,920
But you can just be my girlfriend

314
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:09,160
Why?

315
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,700
I am afraid my parents can't accept you

316
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:17,319
Your parents barely see me

317
00:26:17,319 --> 00:26:18,799
How can they refuse me?

318
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:22,625
My parents won't allow me to 

319
00:26:22,625 --> 00:26:25,480
marry a girl three years older than me

320
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,319
Am I older than you just today?

321
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,759
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

322
00:26:33,075 --> 00:26:35,119
And they won't know if they don't see my ID card

323
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,559
My parents can tell

324
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:39,839
Xiaoling

325
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,875
As long as we don't talk about marriage or see parents

326
00:26:43,875 --> 00:26:46,279
we can go on dating

327
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,200
Asshole

328
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:27,240
I have told you

329
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,200
He is an asshole

330
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,440
But you don't believe me

331
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:39,279
Cheer up

332
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,880
It's a good thing that you break up with him

333
00:27:44,225 --> 00:27:47,640
It's so miserable if you go on dating him like this

334
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,680
Cheer up

335
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,839
Happy for you

336
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,175
Do you think I am a loser?

337
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,799
No

338
00:28:10,039 --> 00:28:12,673
Next year I will be 33

339
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:19,000
What's wrong with it?

340
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:20,920
I am 34

341
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:41,225
33, 34, 35, 36, 37

342
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:44,519
Age is not a problem

343
00:28:45,575 --> 00:28:50,279
Or I can tell Chen Yiming to introduce you another one 

344
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:52,920
He knows many elites

345
00:28:55,050 --> 00:29:00,600
Or you can try blind date website

346
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:23,075
Maybe I will end my life like this

347
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:51,960
No

348
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:01,880
We should follow the normal process

349
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:06,480
I have to fight for another ten years

350
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,960
Fight for another ten years

351
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:09,839
Fight for another ten years

352
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,079
Zhizhi

353
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:23,640
This is Liu Yang's address

354
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:25,960
Thank you Xiaoling

355
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:28,759
I went abroad today

356
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:30,960
Take care of yourself during this time

357
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:32,359
Go abroad?

358
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:33,240
Plastic surgery?

359
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,279
I will be ten years younger

360
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:38,200
Gosh

361
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:40,279
Keep in touch

362
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:53,799
Hello

363
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:57,250
May I ask where block 3, lane 62 is?

364
00:30:57,799 --> 00:30:59,640
Over there, enter the gate and turn left

365
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,200
Thank you

366
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,359
Go

367
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:03,319
Come

368
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:10,920
Come, baby

369
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,519
Wait

370
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:54,640
Come home

371
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:09,839
Yuwei

372
00:32:10,875 --> 00:32:12,799
What are you going to say when we see dad?

373
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:14,960
Dad, I miss you so much

374
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,839
Mom misses you too

375
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,440
Come home with us

376
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:23,150
What if dad doesn't go home?

377
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:26,440
I will be like this

378
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:44,160
Brother Yang

379
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,000
Buy flowers?

380
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,039
Which one do you want?

381
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:48,920
I like this

382
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:49,960
Come, Yuwei

383
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,319
WeChat Pay?

384
00:32:57,319 --> 00:32:58,160
Yes

385
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:00,359
Ok, bye

386
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:01,039
Thank you

387
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,079
Thank you, brother Yang

388
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,559
Brother Yang

389
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,440
Come up

390
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,719
Sister Siyu

391
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:25,920
What happened?

392
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,639
I want to divorce

393
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,760
You are going to...

394
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,440
Divorce

395
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:36,079
I will support your decision

396
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:42,480
It's ok, you have me

397
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,679
Sister Siyu

398
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:45,719
Why so flustered?

399
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:46,679
Supervision Department

400
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:47,800
You need to go to meeting room

401
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,360
Now

402
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,760
Wait here

403
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:09,920
Liu Yang, right?

404
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,519
Sit

405
00:35:32,125 --> 00:35:33,920
We received real-name reports from 

406
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,440
Dayue Group and Sanke Group

407
00:35:35,775 --> 00:35:38,800
In this tender, you are suspected of favoritism

408
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,000
So we are here to investigate it

409
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,199
Miss Li

410
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:48,519
What is your relationship with Liu Yang?

411
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,920
My cousin's husband

412
00:35:51,159 --> 00:35:55,700
During this bidding, did he tell you any info about the experts?

413
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:05,960
I have never done this

414
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,960
I didn't send the email

415
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,039
You can investigate it

416
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:11,760
Do you remember this email?

417
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:18,175
Before the bidding, I received the email

418
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,800
Not over yet?

419
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,519
Not yet

420
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:25,239
But I deleted it immediately

421
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,975
And I haven't contacted any expert on the list

422
00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:30,519
You can investigate this

423
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,675
So did Liu Yang send this email to you?

424
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,840
I don't know

425
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:40,360
I don't know the one who sent the email

426
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:44,104
So, guess, who sent this email to you?

427
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,119
I do not know

428
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,280
What is your relationship with Liu Yang?

429
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,519
He...

430
00:36:56,679 --> 00:36:58,480
He is my team leader

431
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,360
Anything more?

432
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:07,239
I'm just an intern

433
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:10,280
I just do as he says

434
00:37:12,125 --> 00:37:16,239
As I know, you and him are not just intern and leader

435
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:18,880
No

436
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:22,000
We have no other relationship

437
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,880
Do you know Li Siyu, from Lubao company?

438
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:27,320
She is Liu Yang's wife's cousin?

439
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:29,159
Take it

440
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:29,920
Don't worry

441
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:31,800
We have enough money

442
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:34,350
Zhizhi's cousin paid the rest for us

443
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,400
As far as you know

444
00:37:36,559 --> 00:37:38,199
Liu Yang and Li Siyu 

445
00:37:38,199 --> 00:37:40,519
Did they have benefit-based relationships?

446
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:44,440
Now it's still your internship?

447
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,840
I remember it

448
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,440
Liu Yang told me she had a cousin

449
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:50,639
Is it Li Siyu?

450
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:54,039
Ok, to be more specific

451
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,559
Miss Li

452
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,320
This is your signature, right?

453
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:02,800
Yes

454
00:38:05,225 --> 00:38:07,475
You went to pay the hospitalization fee 

455
00:38:07,475 --> 00:38:09,475
the second day you received the list of experts

456
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,760
Two days later, Lubao won the bid

457
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:15,719
My aunt had heart attack

458
00:38:15,719 --> 00:38:17,079
I just wanted to save her life

459
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,760
It has nothing to do with bidding

460
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,000
It's at most the help between relatives or friends

461
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,320
Throughout the bidding process,

462
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:28,360
I didn't break any rules

463
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,880
It's just a coincidence of time

464
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,400
Really?

465
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,519
Indeed

466
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:46,775
I should have told my leader Li Siyu is Zhang Zhizhi's cousin

467
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:48,199
It's my mistake

468
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:50,400
But I didn't play favouritism and commit irregularities 

469
00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:54,625
I didn't get any money from Li Siyu illegally

470
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:59,050
And I believe Li Siyu didn't break the law

471
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:09,360
President Wang

472
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:11,480
I know this from information department

473
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,559
The two companies that lost the bid has launched

474
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:14,960
a real-name report against Lubao online

475
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:18,639
Before bid opening

476
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:21,440
Lubao has the list of experts of the bid evaluation committee

477
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,119
Does it go viral now?

478
00:39:26,175 --> 00:39:29,760
So what will it be in the end?

479
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:32,320
No idea

480
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,719
Prepare for the worst result

481
00:39:39,159 --> 00:39:42,617
The government will cancel the bidding contract we sigened?

482
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,150
It's ok if they just cancel the contract

483
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,440
What's the worst?

484
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:57,280
Today I should see a new client to talk about financing

485
00:39:59,079 --> 00:40:01,000
He seems to know this

486
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,840
He cancelled the appointment

487
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:06,960
Just wait for the result

488
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:08,840
Director

489
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,039
I want to appeal

490
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,719
It's useless

491
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,800
Even if you can prove

492
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:19,079
that email has nothing to do with you

493
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:25,559
But Li Siyu is your cousin

494
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,000
Li Siyu paid the money

495
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,559
And Lubao company finally won the bid

496
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:32,199
It's all facts

497
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,760
They have side witnesses

498
00:40:38,075 --> 00:40:41,320
You really care about Lubao company

499
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:46,920
I even heard you say don't meet, at special stage

500
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:47,719
Something like these

501
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:56,639
Of course

502
00:40:57,275 --> 00:41:00,719
They will do further investigation

503
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,440
You may prove your innoncence

504
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:09,280
It may relate to legal issues

505
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:10,599
Hard to tell

506
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:15,675
But anyway, our reputation will suffer the loss

507
00:41:20,925 --> 00:41:23,519
So to protect yourself

508
00:41:25,975 --> 00:41:30,880
You need to consider the company's reputation

509
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,119
Director Li

510
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:44,639
We decide to cancel all the contracts with you

511
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:47,719
And we will remain the right to hold you accountable

512
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:00,360
Due to company business adjustment

513
00:42:00,679 --> 00:42:02,639
The following personnel will resign automatically

514
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,679
Liu Yang and more

515
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:06,559
That's all

516
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,280
Brother Yang

517
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:38,199
Brother Yang

518
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:41,519
I just received your director's call

519
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:42,280
I know

520
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,440
Is there anything we can do?

521
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:46,199
No

522
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,320
You...

523
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,320
I am fired

524
00:43:05,039 --> 00:43:05,880
Brother Yang

525
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:07,679
Sorry

526
00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:10,159
All my fault

527
00:43:11,199 --> 00:43:13,039
I didn't expect this

528
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,199
I thought...

529
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:16,320
Siyu

530
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:21,250
Why didn't you tell me the moment you received the email?

531
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:26,559
I thought you sent it to me

532
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,480
Impossible

533
00:43:30,679 --> 00:43:31,920
You told me

534
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,039
Don't meet during that time

535
00:43:34,039 --> 00:43:35,119
Don't contact, either

536
00:43:35,719 --> 00:43:36,519
So...

537
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:55,119
Brother Yang

538
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:10,639
President Pan

539
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:11,639
Li Siyu

540
00:44:12,039 --> 00:44:13,239
Check it out online immediately

541
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,800
Check it out online now
