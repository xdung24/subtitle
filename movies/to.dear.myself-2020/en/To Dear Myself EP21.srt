00:01:23,975 --> 00:01:28,925
[To Dear Myself]

2
00:01:30,175 --> 00:01:32,175
[Ep21]

3
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,680
They think I have an affair?

4
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:38,200
Look at you

5
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,319
You are so abnormal recently

6
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,840
You are so abnormal recently

7
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,840
They are women

8
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,480
Haowen

9
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,400
They didn't say anything about me, right?

10
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:55,159
You? Nothing

11
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,040
You

12
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:08,439
Anything wrong, right?

13
00:02:09,158 --> 00:02:09,799
Nothing wrong

14
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,400
Something happened?

15
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:15,439
No

16
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:17,599
No

17
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:18,840
Nothing happened

18
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:20,280
Stop denying

19
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,759
Say it

20
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,240
We can help you analyze it

21
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,199
We won't tell others

22
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,680
It's different from what you think

23
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:33,159
What is it?

24
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,975
In my office, an intern

25
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:38,560
Female?

26
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:39,599
Of course

27
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,759
Something happened when it's a man?

28
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:41,759
Go ahead

29
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,159
I am clean with her

30
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,200
She is like a little girl, and worships me 

31
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:49,960
With a little admiration

32
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,120
Quite dangerous

33
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,879
You won't fall for it, right?

34
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,319
I won't

35
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,280
But to be honest

36
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,475
When I am with Zhang Zhizhi

37
00:03:07,425 --> 00:03:09,825
sometimes I feel tired and bored

38
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:12,319
But when I stay with her

39
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,479
even it's working overtime

40
00:03:14,075 --> 00:03:17,000
I feel easy and happy

41
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:21,199
Things like this are all fresh in the first beginning

42
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:22,560
You will change your mind over time

43
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:24,360
I'm just talking about feeling

44
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,039
I didn't talk about time

45
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:26,960
Don't deny it

46
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,000
I am most qualified to talk about this

47
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:32,680
Your personality is not suitable for being ambiguous

48
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,400
Where am I ambiguous?

49
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:36,840
You are not like me

50
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,639
You are not as free and easy as me

51
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,280
You are not a philander like me

52
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:43,500
In the end you will disgrace yourself

53
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:47,650
More than that, you will disgrace her

54
00:03:48,425 --> 00:03:51,800
Liu Yang, you have a family to support

55
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,579
If something happens to you, your family will suffer the loss

56
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:56,719
And you hold public office

57
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:00,599
From the perspective of investment,

58
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,828
you will have more risk than benfit

59
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:05,240
Don't have any illusions

60
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,850
Don't indulge yourself

61
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,533
And I think you have married Zhizhi for so many years

62
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,080
It's not easy

63
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,040
You should cherish it

64
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,240
Come

65
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:21,720
Don't be impulsive

66
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,120
Don't be impulsive, brother

67
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,399
Tomorrow is your last opportunity for assessment

68
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:05,925
If you still can't pass, my advice is 

69
00:05:05,925 --> 00:05:08,275
you should uy 30,000 batteries and put them at home

70
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,639
How to use?

71
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:12,680
For your girlfriend

72
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:26,839
I called you

73
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:27,800
But the line is busy

74
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,900
I texted you and you didn't reply me

75
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:33,360
I was reviling someone

76
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,125
I bought you some skewers and porridge

77
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,600
It's a little bit cold

78
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,639
You need to heat it before you eat

79
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:46,720
When did you come?

80
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,480
It's about forty minutes

81
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:52,160
I'm sorry

82
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,720
It's ok

83
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,703
I am willing to wait for you even if it's forever

84
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,240
You haven't talked like that for a long time

85
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,639
Siyu

86
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,879
This week of our cold war

87
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,000
I'm really unhappy

88
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,800
I'm not happy, either

89
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,959
I have been thinking

90
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:45,106
What's wrong between us?

91
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:49,279
But to be honest

92
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:55,250
Even till now, I still disagree

93
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:59,079
But the primary cause lies in me

94
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:00,240
I didn't do it well

95
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,959
So you feel insecure

96
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,920
So you make money so desperately

97
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,959
So you choose that method

98
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:17,879
Sorry

99
00:07:20,825 --> 00:07:22,360
I didn't handle it well

100
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:25,160
I'm sorry

101
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:27,879
please forgive me

102
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,040
Yiming

103
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,240
Siyu

104
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,199
Doctor...

105
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,800
What?

106
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,480
This is Li Siyu's medical report

107
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,560
Thank you

108
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,240
She is only 32?

109
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,120
Correct

110
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,079
Nowadays, young people are so...

111
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:59,399
Look, sinus arrhythmia

112
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:01,800
Blood lipid, blood pressure, and blood sugar 

113
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,439
are all higher than standards

114
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,600
Look

115
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,839
Gastrointestinal tract has serious problems

116
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:11,680
What should we do?

117
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:13,279
What does she do?

118
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,279
Saleswoman

119
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,439
Often drink and stay up late?

120
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,600
Correct

121
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:19,720
She should change her job

122
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,800
Or take some rest for a while

123
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,199
Or completely stop drinking

124
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:27,199
Then take more rest

125
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:31,625
combined with proper exercise, light diet and balanced nutrition

126
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,480
Maybe she will recover

127
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:36,919
Wait

128
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:39,240
You're awake

129
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:40,559
Where am I?

130
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,320
This is the hospital

131
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,399
What's wrong with me?

132
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,480
You fainted suddenly

133
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:52,879
Don't move

134
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:53,440
Don't move

135
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,480
Lie down...

136
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:57,039
I will elevate the bed

137
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:11,840
Is it ok?

138
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:13,519
Yeah

139
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,250
Your blood pressure, lipid and blood sugar

140
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,960
And your uric acid

141
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:32,759
All higher than the standards

142
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,875
And your stomach, kidney, liver

143
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:39,039
And your thyroid

144
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,799
All have problems

145
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,360
Yiming

146
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:57,440
It might be important

147
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:02,320
It's not as important as your body

148
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:11,150
Maybe the doctor took off your ring during checkup

149
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,360
I'm fine

150
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:15,759
No

151
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:18,799
You have a poor stomach all the time

152
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,200
Take the medicine first

153
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:52,316
The doctor told me, you'd better take a long vacation

154
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:54,279
Take a good rest

155
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:56,919
Generally given your current situation

156
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,925
If you don't pay attention to it, 

157
00:11:58,975 --> 00:12:00,975
your health will break down 

158
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,200
So serious?

159
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,600
Come, see it yourself

160
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:35,600
So

161
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,360
You need to have a good rest

162
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,039
Come, drink the medicine

163
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:43,120
Come

164
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:44,879
Be careful, it's hot

165
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:51,310
But now is the critical moment for Lubao's financing

166
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:53,799
Everyone is working hard

167
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:55,639
How could I take a vacation?

168
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:00,399
Unless I quit my job

169
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,559
It's a good idea

170
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,919
You want me to resign, right?

171
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:08,639
Siyu

172
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:12,080
You just want me to stand behind you

173
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:13,960
So you can work outside

174
00:13:18,475 --> 00:13:21,399
Why do you think I do everything for myself?

175
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,120
It's the fact

176
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:28,799
Can you take a good look?

177
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,919
These are the facts

178
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:45,080
I tried so hard to persuade him for hours

179
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:49,120
He is fully aware of his mistake

180
00:13:49,475 --> 00:13:51,960
Then he dated Li Siyu that night

181
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,600
And then they make up

182
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,799
How did you know it?

183
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,519
Yiming called me in the morning

184
00:13:58,025 --> 00:14:00,679
He wants me to find a trustworthy buying agent

185
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:03,800
He needs to buy some health products for Li Siyu

186
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:05,720
Good to know

187
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,791
I have accomplished your task successfully

188
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:11,519
Well done

189
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,879
How do you thank me?

190
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,559
Say it, what do you want?

191
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:23,960
You will give me everything I want?

192
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,440
I want a girlfriend

193
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,559
Haowen

194
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:38,840
Get out of this door

195
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,759
Turn left and turn left

196
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,399
You will see a hotel

197
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,399
Book a room

198
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,080
Then have a good sleep

199
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,720
You will see a girlfriend in your dream

200
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,000
Gu Xiaoling

201
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:51,519
Remember to take the invoice

202
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,480
I will reimburse you

203
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:56,080
No one will help you anymore if you do so

204
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:56,799
Whatever

205
00:14:58,039 --> 00:14:58,679
Great

206
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,360
Remember what you said today

207
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,639
Or I can invite you to dinner

208
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,279
Save it

209
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,440
Mom, I want to watch cartoons

210
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:13,399
You have watched today

211
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:14,440
You can't watch anymore

212
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,799
Grandma

213
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:22,159
Watch cartoons with me

214
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:26,300
Your mom said, don't watch

215
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:31,159
Zhizhi, put this in

216
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,159
Mom, this box still has some space

217
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,279
I'll get you some clothes Liu Yang doesn't need

218
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:38,399
You can give them to relatives

219
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:39,159
Ok...

220
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:40,679
Zhizhi

221
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:44,600
The little granddaughter of the third aunt is of your height

222
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,950
You can give her some clothes that you don't need

223
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:48,320
Ok

224
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:32,440
Zhizhi

225
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:34,559
Zhizhi

226
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:37,559
What?

227
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:39,679
Nothing

228
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:42,840
Put this in there

229
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,639
Yuwei

230
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,960
What is this?

231
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:51,399
Car

232
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:52,039
This one

233
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:54,840
White Dragon Horse

234
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:58,080
White dragon horse sitting on the cart

235
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,440
We are going to drive

236
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:02,399
Did you finish the packing?

237
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,039
Almost

238
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:06,639
I will go back at four o'clock

239
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,160
Ok

240
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:11,279
Call me when you about to arrive

241
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:12,759
Ok

242
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,559
Transfer me to another department?

243
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:25,680
Yes

244
00:17:26,575 --> 00:17:28,759
Did I do something wrong?

245
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:29,759
No

246
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,880
You did nothing wrong

247
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,359
It's my problem

248
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:37,079
Brother Yang

249
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:39,599
I still want to learn from you

250
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,680
Impossible

251
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,400
Why?

252
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:53,319
For your good

253
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,559
Also for my good

254
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,108
We are ordinary friends from now on

255
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,720
Did someone say something?

256
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:10,279
No

257
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:12,200
Why?

258
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,119
Does sister-in-law know something?

259
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:16,440
I can explain it to her

260
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,640
It has nothing to do with her

261
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:22,720
It's my own decision

262
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,680
That's all

263
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,640
I need to work now

264
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:54,839
Mom, leave it to me

265
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,400
Be careful

266
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,960
Mom, get in the car

267
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,160
What?

268
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,240
Get in the car

269
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:30,039
Where's Yuwei?

270
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,559
Chinese studies class

271
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,839
Mom's things are all packed?

272
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:57,119
Go back

273
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:07,640
Mom left

274
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:09,559
We can return to normal now

275
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,440
It's been so many days

276
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,799
My contract has been for a long time

277
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:21,880
Me too, it can't be delayed anymore

278
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,400
What to do?

279
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,440
They are urging me

280
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,880
I am so panic

281
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,000
It's the last week I guess...

282
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:27,039
Sister Siyu

283
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,759
Sister Siyu

284
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,599
Sister Siyu

285
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:32,559
Sister Siyu, sorry

286
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:33,079
You are sick

287
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:34,200
We didn't go to the hospital to see you

288
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,920
Sister, we are wrong

289
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:37,119
It's ok

290
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,079
Get down to business

291
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,912
Sister, I can't fix Daneng company

292
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,079
You need to go there in person

293
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:44,519
Sister, you need to sign it

294
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:46,200
Now the client is waiting for you

295
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,160
This is the fax from Ningbo

296
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:49,880
And this contract

297
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,519
Take a look

298
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:52,160
If there is no problem, sign it

299
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,675
We have received Tianyou Energy's final payment

300
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,680
Ok, I get it

301
00:20:58,559 --> 00:20:59,440
Go back to work

302
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,440
Come in

303
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:45,839
Sister, your delivery

304
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,640
Ok, leave it to me

305
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:50,240
Thank you

306
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,759
Sales performance belongs to the boss

307
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:11,440
Body is your own

308
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,720
You are mine

309
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,079
Remember to take medicine and warm your stomach

310
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:17,559
Chen Yiming

311
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:19,240
First

312
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,875
What impact will website design have on website traffic?

313
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,799
This is the first point

314
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,000
Another point is

315
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,525
What kind of website design and technology will influence website traffic?

316
00:22:31,877 --> 00:22:33,039
And what the influence will be?

317
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:37,200
I am in a meeting

318
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:38,880
Call you back later

319
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,200
Come in

320
00:22:45,319 --> 00:22:46,119
Sister Siyu

321
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,400
Latest financial statement

322
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:49,750
We exceed our sales expectation this month

323
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:52,720
We set another record

324
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,440
Tell all of them

325
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,839
I will invite them to dinner tonight

326
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:04,000
Ok

327
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,640
Sister Siyu will invite us to dinner tonight 

328
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,375
Celebrate our sales department's another record

329
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,920
Thank you, sister Siyu

330
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,319
You said, you invite me to dinner, right?

331
00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:52,400
I'm hungry

332
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,559
Gu Xiaoling

333
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:13,200
We need to keep our promise

334
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:15,480
Please fulfill your promise

335
00:24:16,025 --> 00:24:21,039
The best dishes, the best wine in the world

336
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,240
And the most beautiful boy in this alley

337
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,519
Are waiting for you

338
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:02,359
Who's there?

339
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:03,319
Me

340
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,079
I'm coming

341
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:12,440
It's so late, what seems to be the problem?

342
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:13,839
Talk inside

343
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,440
Say it here

344
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:23,160
I want to drink water

345
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:24,799
Buy it downstairs

346
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,079
I saw your boyfriend

347
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,240
Oh

348
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,880
The man has a problem with his face

349
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,960
I am here to remind you

350
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,599
You still know this?

351
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:34,839
Didn't you see?

352
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,640
He has hanging needle wrinkle on his ophryon 

353
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:37,680
It will curse his wife

354
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,200
Really?

355
00:26:39,475 --> 00:26:41,720
He is a womanizer according to physiognomy

356
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,200
He is the last man to be your boyfriend

357
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:47,279
So what kind of boyfriend should I have?

358
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,425
You should find a Cancer man, 

359
00:26:51,425 --> 00:26:53,430
1.80 meters tall and 70 kg heavy

360
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:58,975
And he is a passionate man with a pair 

361
00:26:58,975 --> 00:27:05,225
of affectionate, clean and warm eyes

362
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:10,880
You are recommending yourself, right?

363
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:13,240
Don't be so direct

364
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:14,920
Lei Haowen

365
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:16,920
I see you as a friend

366
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,480
Why do you still give up?

367
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,000
I also see you as a good friend

368
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,750
We need to share good things with good friends, right?

369
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:24,599
I share myself with you

370
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:25,119
Am I wrong?

371
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:25,880
Pooh

372
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:28,000
That man is problematic

373
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:30,119
He is better than you, though

374
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:31,039
Where?

375
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:31,880
Everywhere

376
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:34,571
At least I didn't send you gifts picked from refuse dump 

377
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:36,839
Get out

378
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:38,240
Go...

379
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,599
Gu Xiaoling

380
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:40,200
Shut up

381
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,400
Don't come to me crying after you suffer loss

382
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,880
I won't go to see you even if I die

383
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,599
You will regret

384
00:27:44,599 --> 00:27:45,240
Shut up

385
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:10,799
Zhizhi

386
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:16,039
Zhizhi

387
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,880
What are you doing?

388
00:30:42,825 --> 00:30:45,200
You didn't have enough rommance with colleague in office?

389
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:48,960
What do you mean?

390
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:51,359
You and Wei Yayun

391
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:52,960
What's your relationship?

392
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:55,960
Colleague

393
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,079
What kind of colleague?

394
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,039
Ordinary colleague

395
00:31:12,759 --> 00:31:13,680
What's the embroidery?

396
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,400
You love me, I love you

397
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:17,200
Ordinary colleague?

398
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:19,079
Stop lying. Liu Yang

399
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:25,359
You're just being paranoid because of this?

400
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:30,100
This scarf belongs to Wei's boyfriend

401
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:33,680
Her boyfriend's name is Li Lei

402
00:31:34,119 --> 00:31:35,736
You think L means me?

403
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:39,519
Really?

404
00:31:41,075 --> 00:31:43,599
You can invite Wei's boyfriend to dinner

405
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,119
Then you will know

406
00:31:49,075 --> 00:31:52,050
Why do you have her boyfriend's scarf?

407
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,920
I worked overtime too late

408
00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:00,960
And I felt uncomfortable

409
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,750
She lent me her boyfriend's scarf

410
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:09,121
You borrowed her boyfriend's scarf?

411
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,200
Just need to leave it outside

412
00:32:12,075 --> 00:32:15,643
Why do you put it at the bottom of the storage box?

413
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:17,599
It's packed in a gift bag

414
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:24,575
And why did you delete all your traces of your communication with her?

415
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,720
We are clean

416
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,119
You deleted it because of a guilty conscience

417
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:31,519
Whatever you say

418
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,799
Morning, dad

419
00:32:49,799 --> 00:32:50,519
Morning

420
00:32:56,839 --> 00:32:57,880
Do you like the fried dough stick?

421
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,599
Yes

422
00:32:58,759 --> 00:32:59,640
Give me some

423
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,440
Really great

424
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,240
Bought at the new store, right?

425
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,559
Yuwei, do you like the soy milk?

426
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:16,640
Yes

427
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:17,920
Come, cheers

428
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:23,240
So great

429
00:33:25,875 --> 00:33:29,839
Dad, you can send me to Chinese Studies class, right?

430
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:32,759
Not today

431
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,319
I need to work overtime today

432
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,640
Work overtime every day

433
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,640
After this period, I will take an annual leave

434
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,250
Then we will go to travel with mom, ok?

435
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:47,839
Great

436
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:48,559
Yeah

437
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:10,039
I have to go to work now

438
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:17,840
I'm going to work now

439
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:27,840
Be a good girl

440
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:58,920
Mom

441
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,400
When do we go?

442
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,119
Right away

443
00:35:17,559 --> 00:35:18,280
Come

444
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:23,821
Wait for me

445
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:29,960
Sister in law

446
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:33,039
Is Liu Yang here?

447
00:36:33,639 --> 00:36:34,840
He went to the construction site

448
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:37,000
Where's Wei Yayun?

449
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:38,079
Wei Yayun

450
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,679
Went to the construction site, too

451
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:00,840
Team leader Liu

452
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,000
Thank you

453
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:10,960
Be careful

454
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:11,920
Ok, team leader Liu

455
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,800
Mr. Liu

456
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:29,440
Why are you here?

457
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:34,119
I told Li to take over your work

458
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,239
I need to hand over some work on site

459
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:41,375
So this is the last time I am here

460
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,800
Where's Li?

461
00:37:44,239 --> 00:37:45,199
He hasn't arrived yet

462
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:57,119
You should take some rest for a while

463
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,239
Wei, come here

464
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,079
Coming

465
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:32,159
What's the matter?  -What is this?

466
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:35,320
Here

467
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:36,800
This...

468
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,320
Wei

469
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:47,079
Wei Yayun

470
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:51,360
I... you are

471
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:55,519
I need to see Liu Yang

472
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,519
Mr. Liu Yang is over there

473
00:38:58,519 --> 00:38:59,360
I will tell him now

474
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,159
Mr. Liu Yang

475
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:04,920
What happened?

476
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:09,800
Install that later

477
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,719
Why are you here?

478
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:25,039
You looked it up before going to bed yesterday

479
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,280
You forgot it at home

480
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,679
So I brought it here

481
00:39:30,199 --> 00:39:31,400
I'm afraid you might need it

482
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,880
I will let you two talk

483
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:35,825
Wei

484
00:39:39,375 --> 00:39:42,490
Did you return her scarf?

485
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:46,199
I brought it

486
00:39:46,199 --> 00:39:47,039
I'll return it to her later

487
00:39:52,039 --> 00:39:52,639
Wei

488
00:39:53,125 --> 00:39:56,475
Days ago, you lent your boyfriend's scarf to me, right?

489
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,280
She is misunderstood

490
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,800
Thank you for the scarf

491
00:40:08,575 --> 00:40:11,960
Take your boyfriend to have dinner at my house

492
00:40:16,199 --> 00:40:17,159
I have to go now

493
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:33,039
Why do you have the cup?

494
00:40:41,559 --> 00:40:42,800
You sent it to her?

495
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:46,760
Me?

496
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:53,119
You said, you are clean, right?

497
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,000
Wei, tell your sister-in-law

498
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,079
You bought this cup yourself

499
00:40:59,079 --> 00:40:59,480
Hurry

500
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:03,480
Brother Yang

501
00:41:05,719 --> 00:41:07,440
You gave me the gift

502
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:13,679
What else do you want to say?

503
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,559
Sister-in-law, don't blame brother Yang

504
00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:16,800
Brother Yang did nothing wrong

505
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,599
Shut up

506
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,039
Sister in law

507
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:24,360
Me and brother Yang can't help ourselves

508
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,800
You seduce my husband

509
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,079
You still walk tall?

510
00:41:27,239 --> 00:41:28,639
How did your parents teach you?

511
00:41:28,639 --> 00:41:29,159
It's ok...

512
00:41:29,159 --> 00:41:31,840
You live to be a mistress?

513
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,760
Zhizhi, go home

514
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,760
You walk tall, right?

515
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,280
Zhang Zhizhi

516
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,440
Why are you speaking the harsh words?

517
00:41:43,159 --> 00:41:44,679
You still defend her

518
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,639
Are you insane?

519
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,679
Are you insane?

520
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:49,000
You are crazy

521
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:01,199
Hello

522
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,320
Don't cry

523
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:07,239
What happened to you?

524
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,079
Where are you?

525
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:14,920
Siyu...

526
00:42:16,199 --> 00:42:16,840
Zhizhi

527
00:42:22,679 --> 00:42:23,880
Siyu...

528
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:24,880
Zhang Zhizhi, see

529
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:25,400
What are you doing?

530
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:25,960
Enough

531
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,760
You need to slap him back

532
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,480
What do you want?

533
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,880
Hit a woman, bloody man

534
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:32,239
You can go one-on-one with me

535
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,239
Enough...

536
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:34,599
Siyu, calm down

537
00:42:34,599 --> 00:42:35,519
Which side are you on?

538
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:36,719
Calm down, why stop me?

539
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:37,440
Calm down

540
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,440
Figure out what's going on

541
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:40,360
Liu Yang

542
00:42:40,639 --> 00:42:41,960
Why did you slap Zhizhi?

543
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:43,639
Stop asking nonsense

544
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:45,360
You need to apologize to Zhizhi

545
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:49,000
I am sorry for slapping her

546
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:51,519
I apologize

547
00:42:55,719 --> 00:42:57,639
I treat you wholeheartedly

548
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,880
How can you do such a thing?

549
00:43:02,519 --> 00:43:04,119
How could you?

550
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:06,840
I did not do anything

551
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,480
You did nothing

552
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:13,239
You say, you did nothing

553
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:16,280
Didn't you give her the thermos cup, did you?

554
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:17,519
And the scarf

555
00:43:17,519 --> 00:43:19,519
She gave it to you, right?

556
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:23,239
How could you do this?

557
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:32,480
Even if I do something, you shouldn't make a fuss

558
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,840
What about my reputation?

559
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,400
Reputation?

560
00:43:35,975 --> 00:43:38,519
You would not do such a thing if you care about your reputation

561
00:43:38,679 --> 00:43:40,280
I have said, I did nothing

562
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,000
Fine...

563
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,000
Liu Yang

564
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,079
Everyone, calm down

565
00:43:45,850 --> 00:43:48,079
I think you should take a stand now

566
00:43:48,725 --> 00:43:50,239
You will pay attention to it in the future

567
00:43:50,599 --> 00:43:52,920
Don't make Zhizhi worry about you

568
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,599
We should get over it, ok?

569
00:43:54,599 --> 00:43:55,559
Zhizhi

570
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:57,480
I can't

571
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:01,639
I won't live with him even he can't justify himself

572
00:44:02,125 --> 00:44:03,559
Divorce, no big deal

573
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,280
You are so ridiculous

574
00:44:09,239 --> 00:44:09,960
Divorce

575
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,159
How can you say divorce?

576
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:16,000
I should be the first to mention divorce

577
00:44:16,039 --> 00:44:17,400
How can you mention divorce?

578
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:18,039
Zhizhi

579
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:20,920
Why are you crying?

580
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,320
You dare to scream at Zhizhi again?

581
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:22,920
Enough...

582
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:23,440
Enough...

583
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:24,400
Siyu...

584
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,000

585
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:25,960
Go...

586
00:44:26,199 --> 00:44:26,800
Go

587
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:27,679
Asshole

588
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:29,960
Ridiculous

589
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:31,280
Calm down...
