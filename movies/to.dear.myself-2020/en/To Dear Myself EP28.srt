There are several process designs

12
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,439
Logical loophole

respect

53
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:48,800

Remember

102
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:15,199
Communication properties of interactive drafts

103
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,680
Better than aesthetic form

104
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,079
Guan Xiaotang

105
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,000
Do you want to give me something

106
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,879

Similar company same position

What do you mean

120
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,639
low wage

121
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,120
The requirements are definitely low

122
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,040
I just want to find one

123
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,199
It's nothing, don't worry

124
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:07,519
The boss doesn't care about my job

125
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,800
What do you think on the market today

126
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,800
Is there a job that meets your requirements

127
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,079
But you give that little salary

128
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:16,600

00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:08,480
Correct

202
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,720
Vent on us at the same time

203
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,279
To you men

204
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:13,320
Hatred

205
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:14,720
Stop talking nonsense

206
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,120
Let's get together

207
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,080
Go go go go go

208
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,039
No. Is this okay?

209
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:18,960
Hurry up

210
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,000
Xiao Meng, want to go together

211
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,840
Together together together

212
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,480
Xiao Jiang, hurry and go

213
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,799
What are you doing

214
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:33,840
We got off work

215
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,879
Who let you off work

216
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,080
Labor Law

217
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,679
Give me back

218
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:43,240
This is the client

219
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,279
Business cooperation program

220
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:45,039
Suggestions made

221
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,360
Before work tomorrow

222
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,840
Give me the revised plan

223
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:50,559
Sister, we need to rest

224
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:54,120
Please call me Mr. Li in the company

225
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,039
Or Miss Li

226
00:11:58,519 --> 00:11:59,200
Manager Li

227
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,240
sister

228
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,840
Are you finished

229
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:09,320
Beijing time

230
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,320
17:10 in the afternoon

231
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,000
I'm done

232
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:12,600
Then you can go

233
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,360
What about them

234
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,480
They have their job

235
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,480
They have

236
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,759
Worked ten hours

237
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:23,720
Time to get off work

238
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,519
Guan Xiaotang

239
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,559
You can not be enterprising

240
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,279
But don't influence others

241
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,440
They are not others

242
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:33,039
They don't want to work overtime

243
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,720
You won't understand

244
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,759
Dream for yourself

245
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:36,399
When working hard

246
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:36,960
Is not

247
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,159
Concept of work and get off work

248
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,080
I didn't think they

249
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,440
Fighting for my dream

250
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,080
Totally for

251
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,240
Fight for your dreams

252
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:44,480
You are too young

253
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,720
Don't understand these

254
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,519
But what I can understand is

255
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,840
Sister Li Siyu, general manager

256
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:51,879
You can't because

257
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:52,759
Misfortune in own life

258
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:53,240
Just work overtime

259
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,440
Punish all of us

260
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,000
what did you say

261
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:58,000
We are not your ex boyfriend

262
00:12:58,279 --> 00:12:59,039
Don't you on us

263
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:00,360
Vent your hatred of him

264
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:01,759
Guan Xiaotang

265
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,240
Go go go go

266
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:46,679
Trabecula

267
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,240
Stop here today

268
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,960
Go back to rest

269
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,200
Mr. Li, this plan

270
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,320
let's talk tomorrow

271
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:31,480
it is good

272
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:34,480
and then

273
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,559
What then

274
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:39,320
You don't announce

275
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,480
The decision to fire me

276
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:54,399
According to this template

277
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,120
Redesign

278
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,039
Outline of user interview

279
00:14:57,039 --> 00:14:58,120
And interview record sample

280
00:14:58,279 --> 00:14:59,399
Before eleven o'clock tomorrow morning

281
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,039
Give me

282
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,480
Thank you

283
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,399
Helped us win

284
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:12,679
One night's rest

285
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,120
Talk about it

286
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:37,600
Which department do you want to change to

287
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,360
As long as the salary is higher

288
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,080
Any department is fine

289
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:44,480
I can remind you

290
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:46,080
Department with higher salary

291
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:46,960
The greater the pressure

292
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,600
No matter how big

293
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,120
It's not the pressure of life

294
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,320
OK, let me ask for you

295
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:08,960
I think

296
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,360
In Caijin

297
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:13,080
Must have no future

298
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:17,440
You have an epiphany

299
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,720
Xiaoling reminded me

300
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:22,559
She said after i retired

301
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,960
Should be a man with silver hair

302
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:27,279
Personable billionaire

303
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:35,720
What do you think

304
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:38,919
I'm trying to say what you said

305
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,279
You don't have to stroke

306
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,679
I have deeply

307
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:42,759
Reflected on myself

308
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,240
I have known her for half a year

309
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,080
Eat and drink

310
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:49,559
Punch chat

311
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,039
Why not a little bit

312
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:52,159
Substantive progress

313
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,240
She's still in front of me

314
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,960
Go on blind date to find boyfriend

315
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,039
why

316
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,320
Because she doesn't like you

317
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,120
Is not

318
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,279
Because my offense was wrong

319
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,839
Obviously is a strategic goal

320
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,920
I used tactical missiles

321
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,480
Sure

322
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,559
No effect at all

323
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,519
I should change the strategic missile

324
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,839
What are you talking about

325
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:19,160
Can you say something

326
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,279
Words i can understand

327
00:17:21,598 --> 00:17:22,318
Gu Xiaoling

328
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:24,240
I just like it

329
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,240
Panini with meat and eggs

330
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:27,920
But I can only give her

331
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,759
A fried dough stick

332
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:30,759
So

333
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:31,640
In a word

334
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,119
I can no longer exchange my true feelings for my true heart

335
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,319
I have to get rich overnight

336
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:43,559
I have an elementary school classmate

337
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:45,880
I don’t even know the multiplication table

338
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,319
Ever since the media

339
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:51,680
Two months Baojun changed BMW

340
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:56,519
You want to quit and work in the media

341
00:17:57,279 --> 00:17:58,240
Aren't you familiar

342
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,279
I would like to hear your views

343
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,880
Haowen, otherwise

344
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:06,920
Don't worry about resigning

345
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,720
Wait for me to slow down

346
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,920
I'll talk to you later

347
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,079
Brothers

348
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,839
How is Siyu

349
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,160
Siyu

350
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:26,319
Should she continue to start her own business?

351
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:27,680
Still thinking about it

352
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,240
Or I let

353
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,119
Xiaoling help you ask

354
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:33,200
I just said that casually

355
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,119
You are in such a good position

356
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:42,599
Only earn seven or eight thousand a month

357
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,000
Too bad

358
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:45,400
If joining calls

359
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,119
I promise

360
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,839
Your first year net profit is 150,000

361
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:48,799
300,000 in the second year

362
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:15,599
I provide brand training

363
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:16,519
Technology and promotion

364
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,880
Let's split the rental profit 50-50

365
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:20,880
I will subsidize you for installation costs

366
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:22,119
Every new member

367
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,519
I will subsidize you another two hundred yuan

368
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,759
I'll come over and sign a contract with you

369
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:35,599
You go

00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:36,200
You a meat

371
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,599
Why are you shrinking back?

372
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:39,119
Remaining blood on the opposite side

373
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:40,400
Right right right first

374
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,680
Zhao Yun Zhao Yun

375
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:42,759
Hit him first hit him first

376
00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:44,039
I see me

377
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:45,240
Look at me, cut me

378
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,200
You now

what happened to you

382
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,720
You don't care about my position

383
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:02,640
Guan Xiaotang Guan Xiaotang

384
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,519

Don't report me

388
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:12,599
I didn't mean to cheat you

389
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:24,119

Listen to me

00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,519

00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:35,960
And jump page

398
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,119
Put it on our internal test page

399
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:37,960
Customers want to see

400
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:39,000
Ok

401
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,160
You serve me a snack

402
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,880
Can't delay, can't make mistakes

403
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,400
Got it

404
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:50,200
I asked around

405
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,119
The general manager does not hire people

406
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,039
R&D Department Testing Department

407
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,000
You definitely can't

408
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:56,680
Where's the planning department

409
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,079
Mr. Pan has suspected that their department

410
00:20:58,079 --> 00:20:59,599
People are superfluous and need to be streamlined

411
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,200
Then it's even more impossible to recruit

412
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,960
As for the library management department

413
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:03,640
Their salary

414
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,720
Not as high as the administrative department

415
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,119
You definitely don't want to go

416
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,680
What about other departments

417
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:10,519
For example, the Finance Department

418
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,279
The Finance Department must request

419
00:21:12,279 --> 00:21:13,240
Have an accountant job certificate

420
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:15,480
What about the Development Department

421
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,680
Your experience and qualifications

422
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,440
Neither support

423
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:24,279
I think you are still in the administration department

424
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,559
More realistic

425
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,759
This is my daughter

426
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,119
Kindergarten's payment slip

427
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,480
Nine thousand a quarter

428
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,559
this week

429
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:50,839
Is the deadline for payment

430
00:21:55,759 --> 00:21:57,839
This is my husband's hospital receipt

431
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,359
Beyond social security

432
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:02,400
I have to bear more than 10,000

433
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,200
Previously saved money

434
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:06,920
It's all spent

435
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,359
If i still rely on

436
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:10,640
Now this salary

437
00:22:11,559 --> 00:22:13,279
I can't make it anymore

438
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,279
Row

439
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,920
I'll help you ask

440
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,160
Thank you Mr. Hu

441
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:27,960
Manager Li

442
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,599
thank you

443
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,720
Manager Li

444
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,480
Trabecula

445
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:36,039
Trabecula

446
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,119
Has the stress tested?

447
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:39,079
Report to Mr. Li

448
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:39,960
First stress test

449
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,720
Passed successfully

450
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,359
Start tomorrow

451
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:42,160
Second stress test

452
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:42,960
Good um

453
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,799
Lao Liu

454
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,279
Network promotion plan

455
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,720
The electronic version is sent to your email

456
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:48,920
it is good

457
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,599
Tingting

458
00:22:50,599 --> 00:22:51,240
Manager Li

459
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,319
Has the content layout changed?

460
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,079
Already fixed

461
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:53,920
You open the internal beta network

462
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,880
So you can see

463
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:56,079
Good um

464
00:22:57,599 --> 00:22:58,160
Zhou Tianyu

465
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:00,039
Newly added

466
00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:01,079
Those franchisees

467
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:02,480
Did Guan Xiaotang put it in?

468
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:03,839
I didn't see it

469
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:06,920
Where's Guan Xiaotang

470
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:09,000
Where's Guan Xiaotang

471
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:33,720
What i want

472
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:40,720
I i think

473
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,200
I stayed up late yesterday

474
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,720
I didn't go home

475
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:44,799
and then

476
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:47,319
Then I said I'll change my mind

477
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:49,480
I played two games

478
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:51,480
and then

479
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:53,079
Then play games

480
00:23:53,079 --> 00:23:54,640
I hit me a little sleepy

481
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,880
I said i sleep

482
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,480
I'll do it when I get up

483
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,119
and then

484
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,839
And then you woke up

485
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,839
Don't worry

486
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,039
I am before twelve noon today

487
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:06,759
I will give you

488
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:07,519
Don't worry

489
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:21,480
How to hit people

490
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,799
I did what I promised you

491
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:23,519
How about you

492
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:25,680
I i am confused

493
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,000
Why not pay on time

494
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,480
Why play games in the office

495
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,039
I'm confused

496
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:31,960
Something that doesn't count

497
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,599
I'm not

498
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,960
Get out of here

499
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,559
President Fang

500
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:33,200
Ok

501
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:34,160
Two days later

502
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:36,039
I want to give the company board

503
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:36,920
Submit a proposal

504
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,440
What about

505
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,599
From the perspective of capital

506
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:42,640
Business model for the company

507
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,079
And industrial structure adjustment

508
00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:45,519
You mean to say

509
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:47,160
About re

510
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,279
Packaging emerald

511
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:49,000
Yes

512
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:50,119
So to ensure

513
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:51,400
The proposal passed smoothly

514
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:52,640
Please also in advance

515
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,440
Among the board members of the company

516
00:25:54,839 --> 00:25:55,640
Do work

517
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,319
President Wang

518
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,279
Actually a few days ago

519
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,000
Mr. Pan talked to me once

520
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,640
Ok

521
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,880
What did you say

522
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,200
He asked me to reconsider

523
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,440
About the Lvbao III production line

524
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,319
He hasn't given up yet

525
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:30,680
President Wang, I'm thinking

526
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:33,240
If Emerald III goes on the market

527
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,200
Roll out

528
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,119
The valuation of Emerald

529
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,720
Is it helpful too

530
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,160
On the two production lines

531
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:44,559
Eight billion is basically gone

532
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,599
Can have a year

533
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,960
Tens of millions of profits

534
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:49,359
After three to five years

535
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:52,039
Emerald can be valued at 5 billion

536
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:53,920
Is this interesting

537
00:26:56,119 --> 00:26:57,640
But when we created Green Treasure

538
00:26:58,759 --> 00:26:59,799
Just to build

539
00:27:00,279 --> 00:27:01,279
China's best

540
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:02,160
New Energy Enterprise

541
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:04,839
If Emerald’s valuation

542
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:06,000
Can reach 20 billion

543
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,400
Can you say it is not China

544
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,000
The best energy company?

545
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,640
Pan Zhiyong said

546
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,519
Take five to ten years

547
00:27:12,519 --> 00:27:13,680
Realize this dream

548
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:15,839
Use my model for one year

549
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,279
But the valuation of a company

550
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,359
Can not be completely separated

551
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:20,400
Output value and profit

552
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,240
How do you explain Tesla

553
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:26,480
Still losing money

554
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,000
The market value has reached

555
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,279
More than 30 billion dollars

556
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:30,359
Still rising

557
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:33,839
A company's valuation

558
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:35,200
With output value, net value and profit

559
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,240
It doesn't matter much

560
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,960
Asset operation efficiency

561
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,160
Company growth space

562
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:40,400
Decided a company

563
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,680
Can you get a high valuation

564
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:45,839
We should put all the funds

565
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:47,119
Used to create this concept

566
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:48,880
Not what production line

567
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,000
This is the same market I used to face

568
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:55,440
It's really different

569
00:27:55,599 --> 00:27:56,519
is not it

570
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,359
Times have changed

571
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:00,000
Pan Zhiyong's set

572
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,920
Outdated

573
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:02,960
Emerald has to change track

574
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:38,960
Guan Xiaotang

575
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,200
Aren't you fired

576
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,039
Why come back

577
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:48,720
I have a cup dropped here

578
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:50,480
Isn't it just a broken cup?

579
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,640
Throw it away

580
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,079
How many dollars

581
00:28:54,759 --> 00:28:55,599
Poor ghost

582
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:57,200
Why are you working overtime

583
00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:00,000
You left it

584
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,880
What a mess

585
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,880
only you

586
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:05,920
Mr. Li is here

587
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,559
I'm looking for a cup

588
00:30:03,319 --> 00:30:06,000
President Liu, sorry

589
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,079
I have a temporary problem here

590
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:09,599
Can i give it to you tomorrow

591
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:11,279
it's all my fault

592
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:13,240
What I promised you didn't do

593
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,559
I solemnly apologize to you here

594
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:18,440
I'm really sorry

595
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:21,359
I am sorry for you

596
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,319
I promise that tomorrow morning at 8 o'clock

597
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,519
Must be given to you

598
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,640
Okay, thank you

599
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,359
Goodbye

600
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,319
Go home and rest, let me

601
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,599
Aren't you already

602
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:37,960
Turn off the phone

603
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:39,240
Sleep steadily

604
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:50,839
Why go

605
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,680
Carry bag

606
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:44,759
Why are you here

607
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:47,079
Didn't I let you go

608
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,880
Give you a gift before you go

609
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,119
Where's Zhou Tianyu

610
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:56,359
I let him go back

611
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,920
Guan Xiaotang

612
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,279
You deliberately destroy me

613
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:02,039
sister

614
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,400
Have you recently

615
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,480
Endocrine disorders

616
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,319
what

617
00:33:06,759 --> 00:33:07,400
Fire big

618
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,559
What you told that client

619
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:11,559
Tomorrow morning at eight

620
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,640
no problem

621
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:14,079
I promise before six o'clock

622
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:14,880
Let you see the finished product

623
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,160
You call Zhou Tianyu

624
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:19,799
Hello

625
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:22,039
The number you have dial can not be reached

626
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:23,319
I told him to shut down

627
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,240
Don't worry, sister

628
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:28,519
My life is fast and good

629
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,240
I do not believe you

630
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,279
But no one under you now

631
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:35,119
Believe and Believe

632
00:33:35,319 --> 00:33:36,279
Believe it or not

633
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,799
Stop talking nonsense and work

634
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:08,000
You look like my mother like this

635
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,199
Stared at me doing homework when I was young

636
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:11,760
If i were your mother

637
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,079
I beat you to the ground

638
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,679
Guan Xiaotang

639
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,280
Guan Xiaotang

640
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:45,840
Guan Xiaotang

641
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,280
Guan Xiaotang

642
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:50,079
Where here

643
00:34:51,079 --> 00:34:52,119
Why did you go

644
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,920
Buy you breakfast

645
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,559
You still want to buy breakfast

646
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:02,239
sister

647
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,880
Can you change

648
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,280
How angry are you getting up

649
00:35:05,639 --> 00:35:06,760
What time is this

650
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,119
I'm done

651
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:09,760
what

652
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,639
An hour ago

653
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:11,519
Just send your email

654
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:12,559
No thanks

655
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:15,480
Just give me enough overtime

656
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,039
I count you as reliable

657
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:19,960
Then this time

658
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:20,960
Do you need to get out?

659
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:22,519
roll

660
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:24,039
I'm still rolling

661
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,599
Go home to sleep

662
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,559
Xie Xiaozhu Longen

663
00:35:38,199 --> 00:35:40,079
father

664
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,840
All packed

665
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,559
Let's go

666
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,199
Where to go

667
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,119
Discharged

668
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,679
Go home

669
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,519
Yuwei is unhappy when he comes home

670
00:35:58,519 --> 00:35:59,800
Happy

671
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:05,920
Sit down

672
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:07,320
Catch

673
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,559
we

674
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:32,519
Where to go back

675
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:37,880
The house you rent

676
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,519
I have already refunded you

677
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,000
Retired, retired

678
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:54,239
Thank you

679
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:56,920
give it to me

680
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,199
I'm on it first baby come

681
00:37:40,199 --> 00:37:41,920
Mom, I want to watch TV

682
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Can only watch one episode

683
00:37:47,719 --> 00:37:48,360
Ok

684
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,079
Liu Yang

685
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:20,960
You sleep in this room

686
00:38:21,159 --> 00:38:22,440
I sleep in this room with Yuwei

687
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,000
Come

688
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,760
Zhizhi, are all home

689
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:29,920
Why bother

690
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,239
I only hired a half-day shift

691
00:38:33,239 --> 00:38:34,280
Go back to the company

692
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:36,079
You accompany Yuwei

693
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,000
I'll cook dinner when I come back

694
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,960
Come, dad hug

695
00:39:20,239 --> 00:39:21,800
Three years ago, it should be considered

696
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,320
The golden age of self-media entrepreneurship

697
00:39:23,559 --> 00:39:25,000
But since last year

698
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,519
This craze began to recede

699
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:27,639
Till today

700
00:39:27,639 --> 00:39:28,840
Since the media has become

701
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,599
A piece of red sea

702
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:34,159
That means I'm late

703
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:36,119
It should be said that pure reliance

704
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:37,199
Personal operating public account

705
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:38,559
The myth of realization

706
00:39:39,239 --> 00:39:39,960
Now basically

707
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:40,920
Impossible to show up

708
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,599
Then my road to riches

709
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:46,760
It's already blocked

710
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,320
Not without a chance

711
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,920
I currently cooperate with a

712
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,119
Self-media company

713
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:55,159
Its annual income

714
00:39:55,639 --> 00:39:57,079
Still above a million

715
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,519
But they operate as a team

716
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,159
The content goes

717
00:40:01,159 --> 00:40:02,639
Boutique personalized route

718
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,400
And monetization channel

719
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,239
Special clarity

720
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,760
Say these

721
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,599
I don't have any conditions

722
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,760
Then don't worry about resigning

723
00:40:16,159 --> 00:40:17,559
That won't work

724
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,159
Gu Xiaoling has registered online

725
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:21,199
Start to marry

726
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,239
Actually currently

727
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:26,480
In the self-media industry

728
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,360
No one has become a financial institution

729
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,679
Brand building content

730
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,239
After the number of fans goes up

731
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,000
Can both put the flow

732
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:36,280
Convert to ad

733
00:40:36,679 --> 00:40:37,880
Can also be transformed into

734
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,719
Clients of financial institutions

735
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,039
This is also a way

736
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,119
If you can

737
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:48,360
If you put the team together

738
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,920
I can help you with content

739
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,280
Righteousness

740
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,880
I knew it

741
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:01,079
I still have this

742
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:02,239
The life of getting rich overnight

743
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,239
What you asked me about

744
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:11,920
How's it going

745
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,199
what's up

746
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,679
Didn't you say you were looking for Gu Xiaoling

747
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:16,639
Can you find out for me

748
00:41:18,199 --> 00:41:19,159
People think about rain now

749
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,639
Must be better than you

750
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,079
Look at you now

751
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:28,960
Her company

752
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,920
How is the preparation

753
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,360
I don't know

754
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:39,880
Guan Xiaotang

755
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,239
Do you want to be beaten again?

756
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,360
Before eleven o'clock tomorrow morning

757
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,880
I must see the finished product

758
00:41:49,239 --> 00:41:50,400
I haven't slept yet

759
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,239
You just want to sleep

760
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:52,400
that's it

761
00:42:05,639 --> 00:42:06,440
Gu Xiaoling

762
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,639
Can you mute

763
00:42:07,639 --> 00:42:08,599
So noisy

764
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:11,000
Here comes here comes

765
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:16,280
Take a look

766
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:18,400
What are you doing lately

767
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:19,559
Business is so busy

768
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:20,559
That website

769
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:22,360
Recommended me a bunch of candidates

770
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,840
A bunch of

771
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:26,119
Dozens

772
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,000
Do you see dozens of them?

773
00:42:28,199 --> 00:42:30,159
I did a preliminary audition

774
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,440
More than ten left

775
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:33,039
I'm going to see you together these two days

776
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:34,639
Sea election

777
00:42:35,079 --> 00:42:35,719
How to follow

778
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,800
It's like recruiting

779
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,719
This is much more important

780
00:42:40,679 --> 00:42:42,280
Is the recruitment inappropriate?

781
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,559
You can quit at any time

782
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,360
If this blind date is taken away

783
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,440
That's for a lifetime

784
00:42:46,679 --> 00:42:48,320
Then do you still have a

785
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,840
First test, second test, finals

786
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:52,239
You are really right

787
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:53,960
Show you show you

788
00:42:55,199 --> 00:42:56,079
You show me this

789
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,760
How about how about

790
00:42:58,719 --> 00:42:59,679
You show me

791
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:00,360
No time

792
00:43:00,519 --> 00:43:02,039
Hurry up, help me see

793
00:43:02,599 --> 00:43:03,199
how about it

794
00:43:03,519 --> 00:43:04,800
what

795
00:43:05,239 --> 00:43:06,039
take a look

796
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:10,400
Phoenix Group Dark Horse Group

797
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,400
Birth Good Life Group

798
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,559
Resurrection group

799
00:43:14,239 --> 00:43:14,800
correct

800
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,519
Then you divide these groups

801
00:43:17,519 --> 00:43:18,440
What's the use

802
00:43:21,639 --> 00:43:23,679
I'll rate them

803
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,920
According to their height and weight

804
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:27,960
Family

805
00:43:28,119 --> 00:43:29,800
The most important thing is economic conditions

806
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,360
The data will also be wrong

807
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:33,559
so

808
00:43:33,559 --> 00:43:35,159
I want from each group

809
00:43:35,159 --> 00:43:36,280
Pick the top two

810
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:37,800
Then conduct an interview

811
00:43:39,679 --> 00:43:41,079
Then please ask Miss Gu

812
00:43:41,199 --> 00:43:42,599
How many points do you rate yourself

813
00:43:43,159 --> 00:43:45,400
With my beautiful appearance

814
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,159
It's got 100 points anyway

815
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,559
You are not original

816
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,199
My name is original fine tuning

817
00:43:52,519 --> 00:43:53,280
correct

818
00:43:53,559 --> 00:43:55,440
My skin has completely recovered recently

819
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:56,039
See if i am

820
00:43:56,039 --> 00:43:56,880
Look younger

821
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:57,800
Can you add 20 points

822
00:44:01,679 --> 00:44:02,719
Take a look

823
00:44:09,199 --> 00:44:10,440
I have another one here

824
00:44:10,719 --> 00:44:12,159
Photos from 10 years ago

825
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:13,559
Take a look

826
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:14,360
You show me

827
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:14,960
Am I better than before

828
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:15,840
Younger

829
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,079
photo

830
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:25,079
I actually have another one here

831
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:26,639
A photo of you and Chen Yiming

832
00:44:37,639 --> 00:44:38,840
When did you sneak a photo

833
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:39,880
I do not know how

834
00:44:40,039 --> 00:44:40,880
Just you two

835
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,119
At that time

836
00:44:42,559 --> 00:44:43,719
My mother got it

837
00:44:43,719 --> 00:44:44,800
I was very anxious to know

838
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:45,599
how does he look like

839
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:47,000
Then I secretly took a picture

840
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:49,320
delete it

841
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,119
Are you willing

842
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:54,360
This is out of print

843
00:44:54,519 --> 00:44:55,519
What out of print

844
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,480
Don't think i don't know

845
00:44:57,639 --> 00:44:58,639
You put Chen Yiming

846
00:44:58,639 --> 00:44:59,719
All contact

847
00:44:59,719 --> 00:45:00,519
All blacked out

848
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:01,760
All the photos

849
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:02,840
Also deleted

850
00:45:06,679 --> 00:45:07,880
I want to delete it

851
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:09,360
But there is nothing

852
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:10,760
delete

853
00:45:12,159 --> 00:45:12,679
it is good

854
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:15,119

855
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,679
Don't delete send me

856
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:22,599
I knew it

857
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:23,760
No talking

858
00:45:29,239 --> 00:45:30,480
Go for a beauty sleep
