00:01:26,775 --> 00:01:29,700
[To Dear Myself]

2
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
[Ep8]

3
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,879
Director Wang

4
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,000
This is tender plan?

5
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:56,239
Yes

6
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:57,200
Have you checked it?

7
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,799
Mr. Lu

8
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,840
I received it this morning

9
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,239
I browsed it

10
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:04,599
I didn't check it carefully

11
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,239
Ok

12
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,079
Check it carefully now

13
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:09,719
The fourth row of the third page of the attachment

14
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,199
Mr. Lu, I'm sorry

15
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,680
I stayed up late and I was muddle-headed

16
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:28,719
I mistook the numbers

17
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,719
And the first row on the fifth page

18
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,080
Mr. Lu

19
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:38,199
Sorry, I missed it

20
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,750
I was just browsing and found the low-level errors

21
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,800
I'm sorry...

22
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:53,822
The depth and quality of tender plan will determine the success

23
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:57,850
It also reflects the company's management level

24
00:02:59,425 --> 00:03:05,520
Your tender plan is going to ruin our reputation

25
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:08,560
President Lu, I'm sorry

26
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:09,759
It's my negligence

27
00:03:10,325 --> 00:03:14,400
We will recheck it immediately

28
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:18,400
Liu

29
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,639
You just said, stay up late

30
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:22,175
You want to blame me that 

31
00:03:22,175 --> 00:03:23,520
I didn't give you enough time?

32
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:24,479
No... President Lu

33
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:25,680
We have enough time

34
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,439
I didn't arrange the time well

35
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,879
I will give you another two weeks

36
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:35,550
If you still can't do well, I will leave it to someone else

37
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:40,879
President Lu

38
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:45,680
What's wrong with you?

39
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,479
It's ok...

40
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,879
All these are ok

41
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:57,400
All...

42
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,759
Wu, come with me

43
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:02,520
What's wrong, mate?

44
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:05,840
Look here

45
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,039
And here

46
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,759
And here

47
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:12,879
What's going on?

48
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:13,599
I...

49
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:17,879
Wei Yayun

50
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:19,920
Come over

51
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,759
Hurry

52
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:30,375
Tell him, what you did

53
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,480
You did this?

54
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:35,519
Yeah

55
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:40,279
This is common sense, you don't know?

56
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,319
And here

57
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:44,079
Compared with the previous paper, 

58
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:46,199
you just need to change the order

59
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:47,040
You can't even do this?

60
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,720
And here

61
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:56,025
You don't know or it's your carelessness?

62
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,199
Sorry, I was negligent

63
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,800
Just because of your negligence

64
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,279
the tender plan failed

65
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,399
You wasted his time

66
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:12,040
What's in your head?

67
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:14,240
You want to end your internship like this?

68
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,439
I think you should leave now

69
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:16,399
Enough...

70
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,199
Go back to work

71
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,775
Young people are so unreliable now

72
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:29,075
I was thinking it's easy

73
00:05:29,075 --> 00:05:30,879
And I wanted to give young people more chances

74
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:31,639
So I left it to her

75
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,600
I didn't expect...

76
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,079
Sorry, mate

77
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:35,920
I will go to change it...

78
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,759
I won't make the mistake next time

79
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:38,800
No need

80
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,639
I'll do it myself

81
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,920
You don't trust me?

82
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:43,839
Wu

83
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:44,879
I am busy now

84
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:46,399
We will talk about it another time

85
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:50,480
Ok, talk about it another time

86
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:11,667
In the lineup, Doudou almost knocked Miaomiao down again

87
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:12,560
Really?

88
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,920
Also pushed my William

89
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:14,959
Yes

90
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:16,560
He also provoked my Xingxing

91
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,240
Does Doudou have ADHD?

92
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:21,279
Yes

93
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:23,079
We should say something

94
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:25,920
Our kids' class can't have an insane classmate

95
00:06:27,775 --> 00:06:30,199
What should we do?

96
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:33,879
Is it a bit discriminatory?

97
00:06:34,275 --> 00:06:37,120
Doudou almost bullied all the classmates 

98
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,319
If all the parents turn blind to it,

99
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:40,720
teachers can't do anything to him

100
00:06:41,075 --> 00:06:43,480
we need to do something

101
00:06:44,325 --> 00:06:46,319
So what should we do now?

102
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:52,920
We can write a joint letter

103
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,959
Joint letter?

104
00:06:54,475 --> 00:06:57,360
Ok, then we ask the parents to sign it

105
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,800
Yes, it's a good idea

106
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,600
It's ok?  Well, it's a deal

107
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,360
Yes...

108
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,399
It's almost done now

109
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:06,319
Turn on the lights

110
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:10,279
So beautiful...

111
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:11,040
Look, so beautiful

112
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,279
The color is so good

113
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:13,519
Beautiful

114
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:16,399
Nowadays, kids are so happy

115
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:17,319
Yes

116
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:19,240
All because you are a wonderful mother 

117
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,120
Yeah...

118
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:20,959
Let me tell you

119
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:22,040
The party is so great

120
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,279
In the future, we should hold more parties like this

121
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:25,879
The color is so great

122
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:26,600
Yes, see

123
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,560
So pink, it's like in a fairy tale

124
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,079
Right?

125
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:29,639
Look

126
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:31,160
It's a good place

127
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:32,319
Yes...

128
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,959
We should be well dressed at the party

129
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:35,680
Of course

130
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,800
Of course, let me think

131
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,125
Earlier on, my husband bought me a nice dress in Australia

132
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,079
I'll wear that

133
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:47,575
Last month, I ordered a gown

134
00:07:48,175 --> 00:07:52,750
I will wear the vintage dress grandma left me

135
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:54,079
Vintage dress?

136
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,000
I didn't see it before

137
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,959
Yuwei's mom

138
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:59,120
You can't dress so casually till then

139
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,480
I...

140
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,000
Yeah, Yuwei's mom

141
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,160
You need to wear something special

142
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:05,399
Yes

143
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,647
Look at your shoes and bag

144
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:08,839
You need to change it

145
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:10,079
Otherwise it will be so unsightly

146
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,480
I wear so because I have to do something

147
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:15,439
Yuwei's mom

148
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:16,600
Come, have some tea

149
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,720
After I finish this

150
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,480
Thank you

151
00:08:22,225 --> 00:08:25,720
Which kitty is hiding in the quilt?

152
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,279
Let me see

153
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,720
You are back

154
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:31,199
Mom

155
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,000
You're back finally

156
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:34,600
What's wrong?

157
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,879
She doesn't like my storytelling

158
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:37,320
She is so naughty

159
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,125
I want to hear mom's The Daughter of The Sea

160
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:41,360
Ok...

161
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,039
Come, here

162
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,080
Let your mom tell you a story

163
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,279
Ok, I will tell you a story

164
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,000
Here

165
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,879
Come, I will tell you a story

166
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,159
Come

167
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,000
Deep under the sea live a grandma

168
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:05,279
and six beautiful princesses

169
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:07,559
They have no legs

170
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:09,360
But with a fish tail

171
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:11,600
They are mermaids

172
00:09:12,675 --> 00:09:15,360
Princesses mermaid are very beautiful

173
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:17,679
Especially the youngest one

174
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,360
Yuwei, come

175
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:28,279
I have something to ask you

176
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:35,679
Doudou often bullies other classmates, right?

177
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:39,025
Doudou likes to provoke others

178
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,120
But he doesn't bully others

179
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,720
Did he provoke you?

180
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:48,600
He threw the grass in the garden to me today

181
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:53,960
What did you do?

182
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,000
I just ignored him

183
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,519
Did the teacher know this?

184
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,960
Teacher knew

185
00:10:01,275 --> 00:10:04,320
Teacher criticized him and he apologized to me

186
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:08,559
But soon he became naughty again

187
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:10,480
He went to tease Miaomiao

188
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,480
Then Miaomiao cried

189
00:10:13,425 --> 00:10:16,320
So other classmates dislike him, right?

190
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,250
Sometimes yes, sometimes no

191
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:22,440
Why?

192
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:25,000
Because he can play as little animals

193
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,679
I like it

194
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:32,559
Eighteenth century

195
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,120
Rococo Watteau

196
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:45,600
Boucher Fra

197
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,679
Boucher Fo...

198
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:56,360
Sixteen

199
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:05,320
The sun rises

200
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:09,000
The little mermaid feels she is light and transparent

201
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:14,275
She rides higher and higher on the rosy clouds

202
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:17,519
Some voice from the sky

203
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,000
Zhizhi

204
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,159
What's up? Mom

205
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,039
Zhizhi

206
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,279
Drink it

207
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,799
What is this? Mom

208
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:39,240
It's good

209
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,879
You can have a son after you drink it

210
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:44,559
Mom

211
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:46,120
It's a bit hot

212
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,480
You should put it there first

213
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,440
I'll drink it later

214
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,400
You have to drink it while it's hot

215
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,879
Drink it

216
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,279
Mom, I'm a little tired

217
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,120
Just put it there first

218
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,879
Why are you so stubborn?

219
00:11:59,175 --> 00:12:01,159
Drink while it's hot

220
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:01,720
Drink...

221
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,559
No, mom

222
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,120
What happened?

223
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,799
Mom, I...

224
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,840
I...

225
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:13,279
What did I do?

226
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,360
Are you all right?

227
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:17,039
I boiled a bowl of medicine

228
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:19,320
But she refused it

229
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:21,039
Mom is old and has a poor health

230
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:21,919
What are you doing?

231
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,960
Grandma, are you ok?

232
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:28,039
My hands are scalded

233
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:31,080
Mom, sorry

234
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,200
I didn't mean it...

235
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,480
Zhizhi

236
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,039
Blame me, I am a busybody

237
00:12:38,575 --> 00:12:41,320
I do this for your own good

238
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,559
Don't be angry

239
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:45,720
I will drink it next time

240
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,159
I will drink

241
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:48,799
Don't wait for next time

242
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,080
Yang

243
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:50,759
Mom, what?

244
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,145
Get some medicine in the pot for Zhizhi

245
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,039
It's hot now

246
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,440
No, you...

247
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:57,360
Never mind my hands 

248
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,279
Go now

249
00:12:58,679 --> 00:12:59,639
Hurry

250
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:03,799
Grandma, I will blow for you

251
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:05,360
Ok, baby

252
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,450
Drink before it's cold

253
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,279
It's late at night, don't make troubles

254
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,600
Drink it

255
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:48,600
Who?

256
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,600
Help...

257
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,120
Help

258
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,480
Help

259
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,480
Gu Xiaoling

260
00:14:04,325 --> 00:14:06,480
You need to return my money now

261
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,039
I...

262
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:09,320
When do I owe you money?

263
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,159
Miss Gu

264
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:14,320
I have the loan contract you have signed

265
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:16,799
You...

266
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:18,200
You are from Chunfeng Company?

267
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:19,360
Yes

268
00:14:19,575 --> 00:14:21,559
The deadline is next month, right?

269
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:25,850
According to the contract, you need to pay each Thursday

270
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,519
Impossible

271
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,120
See it yourself

272
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:33,639
Page 7

273
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:53,320
How could this be?

274
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:54,759
Ok

275
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,200
It's Friday today

276
00:14:57,159 --> 00:14:58,100
According to the contract

277
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,360
it's one day overdue

278
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:00,759
You need to pay 6600

279
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:01,799
Give me the money

280
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,519
You lied to me

281
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,080
You lied to me

282
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,240
You still want me to give you money

283
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:12,240
Miss Gu

284
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:17,519
Don't be afraid

285
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,500
You should know the consequence of not repaying the money

286
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,000
What do you want?

287
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:31,720
Repay the money as soon as possible

288
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,599
Mom

289
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,839
Here's your favorite steamed buns

290
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:54,375
Mom lined up for half an hour to buy it this morning

291
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:56,559
Thank you, mom

292
00:17:58,039 --> 00:17:58,720
Zhizhi

293
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,000
Drink the medicine before eating

294
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,559
Mom

295
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:09,799
I can't drink anymore

296
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,839
Why?

297
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,279
I got up three times last night

298
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,559
I didn't sleep well

299
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,000
That's right

300
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,720
Huang said, citizens have poison in the body

301
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:22,920
This medicine is to clean your poison

302
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:25,279
Come, drink it

303
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:25,920
While it's hot

304
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:29,200
Liu Yang...

305
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:29,880
I am running late

306
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,640
I have to go to work

307
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,599
It's early now

308
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,000
It's urgent

309
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:34,279
I have to go early

310
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,279
Are you full?

311
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:36,960
I am full

312
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,559
Ok, just go

313
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:39,200
Don't be late

314
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,680
Ok  -Medicine

315
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:41,839
Medicine

316
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,440
Yuwei, be a good girl

317
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,400
Ok

318
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,720
Zhizhi

319
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,480
Drink the medicine while it's hot

320
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,200
Be careful, it's hot

321
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:06,319
Mr. Liu

322
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:09,319
Sit

323
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:37,680
Thank you, Mr. liu

324
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,400
I am sorry that I said the harsh words

325
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:45,920
I hope you don't mind

326
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:47,960
No

327
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,319
Mr. Liu, you are right

328
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,039
Wu is a bit alarmist

329
00:20:57,279 --> 00:20:58,000
Do not worry

330
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,319
As long as you work hard in the future

331
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,000
and don't make low-level mistakes

332
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:04,680
you will pass your internship

333
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,559
Thank you, Mr. liu

334
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,839
Don't cry

335
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,319
Dry the tears, let's eat

336
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,039
Sister Ziru, here

337
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,440
Why only you? Where is Yiming?

338
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,240
He has something to do

339
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,775
Overwork for Caijin's market value?

340
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:45,920
Kind of

341
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,240
Sister Ziru

342
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:52,839
I want to tell you something

343
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,640
I declared the fight with sister Yuan officially

344
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,319
Finally you follow your heart

345
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,759
Actually that's because I have no choice

346
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,225
I want to ask you a question

347
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:07,075
Is it possible that sister Yuan 

348
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,100
and I will make up with each other?

349
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,160
Everything is possible

350
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:15,079
Let's go

351
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:26,759
Some people say Membrane-free energy storage system

352
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:31,400
can only be academic interest

353
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,675
It's not feasible in business

354
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:41,475
It's utter nonsense

355
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:44,319
My reason is

356
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,720
combine the respective advantages between 

357
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,025
membraneless energy storage system

358
00:22:49,025 --> 00:22:50,625
and hydrogen bromide chemistry

359
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,600
Combine these two limited systems

360
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:58,525
We will get a better result than either of them

361
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:02,650
His point of view is totally opposite to my president Pan's

362
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:03,799
Pan Zhiyong

363
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:05,720
Quiet

364
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:12,300
Traditional membrane battery's membrane, and catalyst

365
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:14,839
accounts for half of the cost

366
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,559
But what about this membraneless battery?

367
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,720
It doesn't require membrane

368
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,400
And it doesn't require cathode catalyst

369
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,200
It just needs a small amount of anode catalyst

370
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:33,875
If the research is successful, all the brands on market

371
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:41,950
like Beike, Deke, GNB and Lubao will die

372
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:44,325
He is defaming our Lubao

373
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,279
That's all for today

374
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:47,750
If president Pan is here, they will have a fight

375
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,800
I am looking forward to it

376
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,039
That's all

377
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:55,440
Professor Gao

378
00:23:57,759 --> 00:23:58,920
I want to ask a question

379
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:02,119
Ok

380
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,000
If the question is too low, I will throw a tantrum

381
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:08,650
You say, membrane battery has come to an end

382
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:10,825
But do you know

383
00:24:10,875 --> 00:24:14,744
Lubao's the new membrane battery Lubao III?

384
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,100
It is said that all the indicators of Lubao III are ranked first

385
00:24:20,475 --> 00:24:23,440
In the times without a hero, it's the world of villains

386
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:27,525
So you mean the hero is your membrane-free battery?

387
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:29,000
Let me tell you

388
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,525
If my research is successful

389
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:34,525
Pan Zhiyong's Lubao will come to an end

390
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:36,725
When will your research succeed?

391
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:38,759
When the time comes

392
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,559
Professor Gao, I have another question

393
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,359
Play the lute to a cow

394
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:45,519
I didn't want to come

395
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:46,640
But they insisted

396
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,680
Sister Ziru

397
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:02,475
You want to vote his so-called invention?

398
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,519
I'm a little interested

399
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,599
You should vote Lubao rather than his battery

400
00:25:08,825 --> 00:25:10,720
Our company is preparing for equity financing

401
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:11,720
Really?

402
00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:13,519
President Pan said it himself

403
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,240
Sister Ziru

404
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,680
Xiaoling is in trouble

405
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,200
I have to go now

406
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,079
Do you need any help?

407
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,200
No

408
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,319
Bye

409
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,119
Ok

410
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:36,519
Professor Gao

411
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:38,960
Professor Gao

412
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,519
Professor Gao

413
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,079
Professor Gao

414
00:25:47,825 --> 00:25:52,125
New products in the new energy market are cliches

415
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,200
But your research is different

416
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:57,425
Your research is so revolutionary

417
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,759
Finally someone can understand it

418
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,799
Can I go to your laboratory?

419
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,680
Please, lead the way

420
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,000
Professor Gao

421
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,275
How much money do you need for your research?

422
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,000
20 million

423
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,160
I will make a breakthrough with 20 million

424
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:06,920
20 million

425
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,240
20 million is not much

426
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:14,240
I can pay the money

427
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:17,960
Great

428
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:20,559
But you need to tell the college

429
00:27:21,025 --> 00:27:24,050
The donation is for my lab specifically

430
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,750
It's my investment

431
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:33,960
Ok

432
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,920
You still need to talk to the college

433
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,039
What if I just want to talk to you?

434
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:44,519
What do you mean?

435
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,160
I want to set up a company for you

436
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,000
You want me to leave the college

437
00:27:58,559 --> 00:27:59,359
Professor Gao

438
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,250
As far as I know, the college has been cutting our research fund

439
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,640
Some of them want to close your lab

440
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,319
You know a lot

441
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,599
They have seen your research as chicken ribs

442
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:21,440
I believe they are willing to sell our previous research results

443
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,079
And then?

444
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,440
Then?

445
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,430
Then you will do research without concerns

446
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:29,055
in your own laboratory

447
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:31,400
You don't need to worry about the money

448
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:33,880
You must have a condition

449
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,160
I just want to be a shareholder

450
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:40,839
How much?

451
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:42,599
Sixty percent

452
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
20 million

453
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,240
With 20 million

454
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,075
You want 60% shares?

455
00:28:59,079 --> 00:28:59,920
Professor Gao

456
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,575
Angel investment is no more than 30% generally

457
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,400
And we need to have a stipulation

458
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,950
We need to quintuple it in five years

459
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:11,319
But if I can do it

460
00:29:11,319 --> 00:29:12,799
I won't be like this now

461
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,880
Yes

462
00:29:14,599 --> 00:29:15,960
Actually you can't even guarantee

463
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,640
you will make a breakthrough with 20 million, right?

464
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,200
Professor Gao

465
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:26,800
People are not optimistic about your research

466
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:30,850
More than 50% people think it's futile

467
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:35,175
More than 90% people think you won't succeed

468
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:38,119
The most authoritative scientific journal predicts

469
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:41,675
It takes at least 2 decades to develop membrane-free battery

470
00:29:41,675 --> 00:29:44,166
And achieve the marketization

471
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:59,680
So why are you here?

472
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,960
I'm an investor

473
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,175
I have a different understanding of risk from others

474
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:09,250
I will never accept 60%

475
00:30:12,075 --> 00:30:14,720
60% sounds a bit high

476
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:16,240
But don't forget

477
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:19,880
I'm taking 99% risk

478
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:24,000
Go

479
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:31,680
Professor Gao, let me tell you

480
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:36,700
I believe no one will spend so much money and time

481
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:39,500
in investing such a risky project

482
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:41,119
I'm going to work

483
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:44,920
Work

484
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,559
Ok

485
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:53,720
This is my business card

486
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,375
If you change your mind, contact me

487
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,160
I just put it here for you

488
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,720
Bye

489
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,039
Don't cry

490
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,400
Say something

491
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:38,359
I needed money

492
00:31:39,275 --> 00:31:41,759
So I borrowed 100,000 from a company

493
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,279
You needed money

494
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:48,240
Why didn't you tell me?

495
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,400
You just paid 130,000 for me

496
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,680
I couldn't ask more

497
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,519
And then?

498
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:56,039
I borrow 100,000

499
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,000
I need to pay 140,000 in two years

500
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,240
6000 per month

501
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,680
I don't know why I have to pay 6,000 per week

502
00:32:04,759 --> 00:32:05,799
How could this happen?

503
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:11,075
When I signed the contract, I didn't check it carefully

504
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:14,800
It's such an important thing, you are so careless?

505
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,839
The contract is so thick

506
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:17,640
I can't read them all

507
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,720
Serve you right

508
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:26,000
Sister Siyu, stop scolding Xiaoling

509
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,319
She's sad enough

510
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,680
They came to ask me for money yesterday

511
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:38,000
I had no money

512
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:39,599
They just...

513
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,759
All my contacts received the text message

514
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:47,119
It's so disgraceful

515
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,160
Who are you looking for?

516
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,960
Miss Gu, your friends are here

517
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,359
Great

518
00:33:09,319 --> 00:33:10,880
How's it? Can you pay today?

519
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,039
No

520
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,160
Ask a friend or relative for help

521
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,559
You sent a text message like that

522
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:17,640
Who would lend me money?

523
00:33:18,275 --> 00:33:19,799
You are so eloquent

524
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:21,119
Let me tell you

525
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:23,519
If you don't repay today, I will be tougher on you

526
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:25,640
Why are you so rude?

527
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:28,650
We are here to help Miss Gu solve the problem

528
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:29,880
Not to scare her

529
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:32,960
Miss Gu

530
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:36,775
If you really can't repay the money, I have an idea

531
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:40,350
You can borrow money from another company

532
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,039
You should repay me first

533
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,359
It's trap loan

534
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:45,039
Don't do that

535
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:47,000
Then you can pay it for her

536
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:48,160
Great

537
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,440
106,000 in total

538
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,119
Repay the money

539
00:33:52,119 --> 00:33:53,240
Miss Gu

540
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:56,759
You have seen our means

541
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,400
And we also gave you idea

542
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,839
The rest is up to you

543
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:04,640
Go

544
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:06,119
We will come tomorrow

545
00:34:10,425 --> 00:34:12,159
You cheated Gu Xiaoling with the contract

546
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:12,960
She didn't know it

547
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,679
It's ok

548
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,280
But you broke in and smashed her things

549
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,320
You pushed in

550
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:18,920
What do you want?

551
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:25,400
I will sue you for violent debt collection, burglary

552
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,360
and attempted rape

553
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,760
Believe it or not, I will kill you

554
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,239
And intentional injury

555
00:34:29,625 --> 00:34:31,500
You will be put in jail for ten years

556
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:32,280
Miss

557
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,760
You are framing me

558
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,199
Yeah, I frame you up

559
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,800
You think only you two are rogues in the world?

560
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,280
Zhizhi, call the police

561
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:41,119
Don't move

562
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:41,880
Xiaoling

563
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:43,159
Call for help from the window

564
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:43,880
Don't move

565
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:44,840
Come

566
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:45,800
Stop

567
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,480
Help  -Don't move

568
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:47,440
Help

569
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,920
Sorry...

570
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,760
Sorry...

571
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,960
We are impulsive

572
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,599
We apologize to you, ok?

573
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:02,760
Miss

574
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,000
It's our work

575
00:35:05,559 --> 00:35:07,360
Why do you do this?

576
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:12,200
It's ok as long as Miss Gu returns the money

577
00:35:12,975 --> 00:35:16,875
We will pay all the money with intersts off within this week

578
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,000
But you must apologize

579
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:20,559
And send text messages right away

580
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:21,480
To redeem her reputation

581
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:23,760
And promise not to harass her in the future

582
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:24,920
But...

583
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:26,239
It's non-negotiable

584
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,840
Ok...

585
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,519
Sorry

586
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,679
SMS

587
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,480
Right away...

588
00:35:42,199 --> 00:35:45,100
You clean it up here

589
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,280
I...

590
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,519
Wu  -I...

591
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:49,599
Do it now

592
00:35:51,375 --> 00:35:52,895
Ok...

593
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:08,639
Get out

594
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:34,000
Siyu, you are so awesome

595
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:54,639
Siyu

596
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,239
Thank you

597
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,900
Why do you borrow so much money for no good reason?

598
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,840
I want to study for the master's degree 

599
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:07,679
I need to pay 100,000 yuan tuition

600
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,159
What do you learn?

601
00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:12,875
Art appreciation and art institution management

602
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,000
Are you insane?

603
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,239
No

604
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:20,159
This is my deliberate decision

605
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,239
Our club starts group buying

606
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:25,880
The customers will be lower and lower

607
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,559
I have to change the circle 

608
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:29,079
You don't need to change circles

609
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:30,280
You need to change your mind

610
00:37:32,039 --> 00:37:33,000
What's wrong with me?

611
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:35,199
You suffered a big loss because of Lanke for not long

612
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,480
You still want to take shortcuts, why can't you learn?

613
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,880
Why do you think I take a shortcut?

614
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:43,719
And shortcuts could be a good option

615
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,360
Then why can't it be my option?

616
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,280
You can't take shortcuts before you have the ability

617
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,119
What do you have?

618
00:37:48,125 --> 00:37:49,760
You think the rich men are stupid?

619
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:51,880
You can sweep the board with your face?

620
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,440
Li Siyu

621
00:37:52,475 --> 00:37:54,639
You can't preach me just because you repay the money for me

622
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,079
More than that

623
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:56,960
I even help you pay off your debt

624
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,639
I am qualified to preach you

625
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,360
I can tell you

626
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,760
You don't need to pay the money for me

627
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,760
Ok

628
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,225
From now on, I don't need your help even if I die on the street

629
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:07,700
From now on if I care about you again, I am an idiot

630
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,119
Sister Siyu

631
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:13,519
Zhizhi, leave her alone

632
00:38:15,719 --> 00:38:16,639
Xiaoling

633
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:23,239
Xiaoling

634
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,599
Look

635
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,119
Sister Siyu transferred me 110,000

636
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,360
She wants to transfer it to you

637
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:31,960
You should pay off the loan first

638
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:42,650
Sister Siyu doesn't mean it

639
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,000
She is so good to you

640
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,400
Li Siyu

641
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:13,760
I won't bow to you just because you help me pay off the debt

642
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,400
I will pay you back ten times

643
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:21,450
But I don't want to see you again in my life

644
00:42:22,519 --> 00:42:24,400
I prepared a great dinner for you

645
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:31,079
I am so tired today

646
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,360
I will go to see you another day
