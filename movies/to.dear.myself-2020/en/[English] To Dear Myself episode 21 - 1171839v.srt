00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:34,000
[Episode 21]

4
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,460
They suspect that I have a mistress?

5
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:40,310
Who told you to behave so abnormally recently?

6
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,510
Their imagination is too rich.

7
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:45,830
Women.

8
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:53,760
Haowen, they didn't talk about me, did they?

9
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,120
You? No.

10
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,050
You don't have any issues, right?

11
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:10,820
No.

12
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,720
Is there something new with you?

13
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,060
No.

14
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,890
No. Nothing.

15
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:21,160
Don't just say no.

16
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:25,950
Talk about it. We will analyze for you. We won't tell anyone.

17
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,680
It's different from what you think.

18
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,970
What is it then?

19
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,770
My office has an intern.

20
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:42,820
- Girl? 
 - Nonsense! Would he have any issues with a guy? Continue.

21
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:50,890
There's really nothing between us. Towards me, she just has a little girl's devotion. Admiration.

22
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:58,000
Sounds quite dangerous. Would you not be able to control yourself?

23
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,130
It's not that serious.

24
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:04,420
Having said that,

25
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:10,820
sometimes I feel tired and bored with Zhang Zhizhi.

26
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:14,070
But with her even if it's working overtime,

27
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:17,930
I feel relaxed and interested.

28
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:23,310
These things are just refreshing in the beginning. Try doing it a long time.

29
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,980
I was talking about my feelings. I didn't talk about the time length.

30
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,790
Don't avoid the topic.

31
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:34,110
I am the most qualified to speak about this. Your personality is not suitable for an ambiguous relationship.

32
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,630
How is it an ambiguous relationship?

33
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:40,990
You are not like me. You are not as free and easy as I am. You are not as heartless as I am.

34
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:43,970
You will put yourself in a difficult position in the end.

35
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:48,620
You not only will put yourself in a difficult position, but also will put both you and her in a difficult position.

36
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:52,220
Moreover, Liu Yang, you have an elder person and a child at home.

37
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:58,080
If anything happens to you, the whole family will be in trouble. Also, you work for the government right now.

38
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,540
From the perspective of investment risks,

39
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:03,580
your risk is larger than your earnings now.

40
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:09,310
Don't have any illusions. Don't give yourself any leeway.

41
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:15,810
Also, I think... you have been with Zhizhi for so many years. That's really not easy.

42
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:17,680
You need to cherish her.

43
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:24,720
- Think about it. 
 - Think about it, Brother.

44
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:03,350
Tomorrow is your last opportunity to have an assessment.

45
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,830
If you still can't pass,

46
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:09,080
I suggest that you should buy ¥30,000 worth of batteries to put at home.

47
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:13,980
How are you supposed to use them? Give them to your girlfriend to use!

48
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:28,660
When I called, your phone was busy the whole time.

49
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:31,750
You didn't reply to my messages and WeChat messages.

50
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,400
I've been scolding people.

51
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:40,510
I bought some skewers and porridge for you.

52
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:44,520
It's a bit cold now. Heat it up a bit before you eat it.

53
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:48,210
When did you come?

54
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,760
Around 40 minutes ago.

55
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:52,890
Sorry.

56
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,890
It's okay.

57
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:02,960
Even if I need to wait a lifetime for you, I am willing to.

58
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:10,230
You haven't said anything like that to me in a long time.

59
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,760
Siyu,

60
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:29,040
during this week of ignoring each other,

61
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:32,400
I have been very unhappy.

62
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:39,400
I was unhappy, too.

63
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,660
During this time, I kept thinking...

64
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:46,550
thinking about what the problem is between us.

65
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:55,790
To be honest, I still don't agree with what you did,

66
00:06:55,790 --> 00:07:01,640
but the root of the problem is me. I didn't do well enough.

67
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,930
I made you feel insecure.

68
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:08,190
That's why you're so desperately working to earn money.

69
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:12,280
That's why you did that.

70
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:19,000
Sorry.

71
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:24,390
I didn't take care of things well.

72
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:29,280
I was wrong. Forgive me.

73
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,030
Yiming...

74
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:44,740
Doctor! Doctor!

75
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:49,460
Li Siyu's report has come out. Could you take a look for me?

76
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,560
She is just 32 years old?

77
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,210
That's right.

78
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:57,260
Young people nowadays...

79
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:03,780
Look, she has sinus arrhythmia. And her blood fat, blood pressure and blood sugar are all higher than the normal range.

80
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:08,080
Look, her stomach and intestines also have serious problems.

81
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,780
Then, what should we do?

82
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:14,590
- What's her job? 
 - Sales.

83
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:16,920
Does she drink and stay up late often?

84
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,270
Yes.

85
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:23,300
Then change jobs or take a complete break for a while.

86
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:27,490
If she can quit the alcohol, recuperate,

87
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:30,890
exercise regularly, have a light diet

88
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:34,530
and balanced nutrients, she might recover.

89
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:41,080
- Are you awake? 
 - Where am I?

90
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,420
This is the hospital.

91
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:48,190
- What happened? 
 - You suddenly passed out.

92
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,190
Don't move. Don't move. Lie down, lie down.

93
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:58,400
I'll bend your bed up.

94
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,060
- Is it okay? 
 - Yes. That's fine.

95
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:29,900
Your blood pressure, blood fat, and blood sugar

96
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:33,290
and also your uric acid are all higher than normal.

97
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:36,560
Your stomach, kidney,

98
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:42,100
liver, and thyroid also have problems now.

99
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,310
Yiming,

100
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:57,740
it might be something important.

101
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,980
No matter how important it is,

102
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:03,680
it will never be more important than your health.

103
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:12,460
The doctor probably took your ring off when she examined your body.

104
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,790
I'm fine.

105
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:17,020
How can you be fine?

106
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:19,860
You stomach hasn't been well for a long time now.

107
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:23,690
Take the medicine first.

108
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:55,310
The doctor told me you should take a long break from work and better your health.

109
00:11:55,310 --> 00:12:01,650
If you continue with your situation now and don't fix it, your body will definitely become useless.

110
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:06,760
It's that serious?

111
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:14,360
Take a look for yourself.

112
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:39,410
So, you should rest well right now.

113
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:43,510
Here, take the medicine.

114
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,860
Be careful. It's hot.

115
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:52,460
But it's a critical time for Lubao's financing.

116
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,900
Everyone is working hard, how can I take time off work?

117
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:01,600
Unless I resign and quit.

118
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,160
That's also pretty good.

119
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,780
You want me to resign, right?

120
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,620
Siyu,

121
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:15,570
you want me to be your backing so you can go out and work hard.

122
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:21,920
Why do you always think that I am thinking of myself?

123
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,690
That's how it is.

124
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:30,020
Can you look carefully?

125
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:34,220
These... are the facts.

126
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:45,820
I earnestly advised him for hours.

127
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:49,810
He deeply realized his wrongdoings.

128
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:54,610
That night, he went to meet Li Siyu, and then they made up.

129
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:56,240
How did you know?

130
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:01,020
Yiming called me in the morning. He wanted to find a reliable person

131
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:04,490
to buy some health care products for Li Siyu to better her health.

132
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:07,210
That's good then.

133
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:10,290
I completed the mission which you gave to me.

134
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:12,740
I guess you were reliable this time.

135
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:16,820
How are you going to thank me?

136
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:19,650
Tell me. What do you want?

137
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:24,590
- Will you give me whatever I want? 
 - Yep.

138
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,640
I want a girlfriend.

139
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:41,400
Haowen, if you go out this door, turn left, then turn left again,

140
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:46,160
there's a hotel. You should get a room and have a good sleep.

141
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,150
You can dream about whomever you like.

142
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:50,780
Gu Xiaoling.

143
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:53,170
Make sure you get a receipt. I'll reimburse you.

144
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:56,010
If you continue to be like this, then no one will help you in the future.

145
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:58,090
As you wish.

146
00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:01,490
Fine. Remember what you said today.

147
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:07,120
- How about I treat you to dinner?
- Just keep your "sugar-coated bombs."
 (T/N: metaphor for seeming sweet but actually dragging others into trouble)

148
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:12,560
Mom, I want to watch cartoons.

149
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,330
You already watched one today, you can't watch any more.

150
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,230
Grandma, watch cartoons with me!

151
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:27,550
Your mom already said you can't watch, so we won't watch. Be good.

152
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:32,310
Zhizhi, put this in there, too.

153
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,370
Mom, there's still some room in this bag.

154
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:38,530
I'll give you some clothes that Liu Yang doesn't wear, you can give them to our relatives.

155
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:42,980
Okay. Zhizhi, your third aunt's little granddaughter,

156
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,760
her height is close to yours. If you have any clothes you don't want, give her a couple as well.

157
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,310
Okay.

158
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:33,930
Zhizhi.

159
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:35,800
Zhizhi!

160
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:38,490
- Yeah? 
 - What are you looking at?

161
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:40,430
Oh, it's nothing.

162
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,690
Pack this up, too.

163
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:47,760
Yuwei.

164
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,220
What's this?

165
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,850
- Car. 
 - And this?

166
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,270
White Dragon Horse.

167
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,250
Have you packed everything yet?

168
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:05,430
Pretty much.

169
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:07,610
I will leave work at 4:00 p.m.

170
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:12,050
Okay. When you're almost here, give me a call.

171
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:13,670
Okay.

172
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,000
You want me to go to a different department?

173
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,630
Yes.

174
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:29,080
Is it because my performance isn't good enough?

175
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,680
No.

176
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:36,280
Your work performance is very good. It's my problem.

177
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:41,010
Brother Yang, I want to continue to learn from you.

178
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,580
That can't happen.

179
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,780
Why?

180
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:57,190
It's for your own good. And for my own good.

181
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:02,060
We will have a normal leader-subordinate relation from now on.

182
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:08,710
Did someone say something?

183
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:10,900
No.

184
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,560
Then why?

185
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,650
Is it because your wife knows something? I can go and explain to her.

186
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:19,020
It has nothing to do with her.

187
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:23,960
It's my own decision.

188
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:32,870
That's it. I'm going back to work.

189
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:57,400
Slowly.

190
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,900
Mom, get in the car.

191
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:09,630
What are you doing? Get in the car.

192
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,700
Where's Yuwei?

193
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:34,400
Chinese Studies class.

194
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,080
Have you packed up all of mom's stuff?

195
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,680
Yes.

196
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:58,550
Go back.

197
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:10,660
Mom left so we can go back to normal now.

198
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:23,430
- It's been days. 
 - This contract has been delayed for so long. 
 - Same here. They keep pressuring me for it.

199
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:28,060
- They've made me really nervous. 
 - Sister Siyu is here.

200
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,660
- Sister Siyu. 
 - Sister Siyu.

201
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,220
Sister Siyu, we're sorry. You were sick and we didn't even go and visit you in the hospital.

202
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:36,270
Sis, we were wrong.

203
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:38,240
It's fine. It's fine. Let's just talk about work.

204
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,460
Sis, I can't handle Daneng Company. You need to make a trip over there.

205
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:46,490
Sis, sign this. The client is just waiting for you.

206
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:48,920
This is a fax from Ningbo.

207
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:52,030
There is also this contract. Take a look. If there are no problems, then sign it.

208
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:56,320
We've received the final payment from Tianyou Energy. Please sign for it.

209
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:01,010
Okay, I got it. You all get to work.

210
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,200
Come in.

211
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,510
Sis, this is a package that was expressed delivered.

212
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:48,800
Okay, give it to me.

213
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,070
Thank you.

214
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:13,830
Sales performances belong to the boss. Your body belongs to yourself. You belong to me.

215
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:17,180
Remember to take medicine. Keep your stomach warm. Chen Yiming

216
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:24,030
First, how the website design influences the website's page views. 
 [Siyu]

217
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:26,120
That is the first point.

218
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:34,680
Another point is how the design and technique will influence the website's visitation.

219
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:39,920
I'm in a meeting. I will call you back in a moment.

220
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:44,890
Come in.

221
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,810
Sister Siyu, the latest financial statement.

222
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:50,600
We surpassed our target for this month.

223
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,910
We created a new record again.

224
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:03,330
Notify everyone. I am treating everyone to dinner tonight.

225
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:04,720
Okay!

226
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:10,660
Sister Siyu will treat us to dinner tonight to celebrate a new sales record!

227
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,720
Yeah!

228
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,530
Thank you, Sister Siyu!

229
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:53,420
Weren't you going to treat me dinner? I'm hungry.

230
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,620
Gu Xiaoling,

231
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:15,870
you need to keep your promise. Please fulfill your promise.

232
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:18,920
The best foods in the world,

233
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:21,090
the best alcohol on this earth,

234
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:25,470
and the most handsome boy are all waiting for you.

235
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:02,570
Who is it?

236
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:04,180
Me!

237
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:06,090
Coming.

238
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,170
Why are you looking for me so late?

239
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:14,620
Let's talk inside.

240
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,680
Talk here.

241
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:23,650
Aren't you going to let me in to have some water?

242
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:26,110
Go downstair to buy it.

243
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:28,270
I saw your boyfriend.

244
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:32,440
I'm here to warn you that his face looks like he has a bad personality.

245
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,650
You understand reading faces?

246
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:38,280
Didn't you see? There are hanging needle patterns between his eyebrows. It means his wife is fated to die.

247
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,410
Really?

248
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:44,930
He also has so much white in his eyes. That means he's ruthless. Finding a boyfriend like that is like signing your death wish.

249
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:48,330
Then what type of face am I supposed to look for when finding a boyfriend?

250
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:53,700
You should find a man who is 180 cm, 70kg, born in the year of the tiger, cancer zodiac sign,

251
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:58,140
and has a pair of eyes that are deep yet clear,

252
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:02,000
clear yet warm, warm yet hot,

253
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,390
and hot yet full of affection. A hot-blooded man.

254
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,900
You're just recommending yourself.

255
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:14,230
Don't be so straightforward.

256
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:15,550
Lei Haowen,

257
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:18,560
I consider you a friend, but how come you won't stop having wicked intentions towards me?

258
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,950
I also see you as a good friend.

259
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:23,150
Good things should be shared with good friends, right?

260
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:25,140
I wanted to share myself with you, is that so wrong?

261
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,930
Pei! (spitting sound)

262
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:28,550
That guy has a problem.

263
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:30,140
Even if he has a problem, he's better than you.

264
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:32,140
- In what way? 
 - Every single way.

265
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:35,510
At least I didn't scrounge through a recycling trash bin to get you a present!

266
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:39,080
Scram! Scram! Scram!

267
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,540
Gu Xiaoling, if you suffer, don't come crying to me.

268
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,420
I wouldn't go to you even if I were dying!

269
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,650
Just you wait, you'll regret it.

270
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:46,280
Shut up!

271
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:47,020
[Wang Li]

272
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,050
[Wei Xiaotian]

273
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,870
[Wei Yayun]

274
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:11,850
Zhizhi.

275
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,120
Zhizhi?

276
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:40,920
What are you doing?

277
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:46,310
Did you not have enough intimacy with your colleague at work?

278
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:50,210
What do you mean?

279
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:53,960
You and that Wei Yayun, what's your relationship?

280
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:56,840
Colleagues.

281
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,050
What kind of colleagues?

282
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,000
Normal colleagues.

283
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,990
What did she sew for you?

284
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:17,570
"You love me, I love you." Normal colleagues?

285
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:20,040
Who are you trying to trick, Liu Yang?

286
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,390
I thought there was something serious going on. You're freaking out over this?

287
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:30,640
This scarf belongs to Wei Yayun's boyfriend.

288
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:37,070
Her boyfriend's name is Li Lei. Did you think just because there is an "L" that it's mine?

289
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:40,460
Really?

290
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:44,770
How about we invite Xiao Wei and her boyfriend

291
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:47,260
over for dinner together one day? You'll know then, right?

292
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:53,050
Then, how come her boyfriend's scarf is with you?

293
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:56,030
That day, we had to work overtime until really late at night.

294
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:00,940
My body felt a little bit unwell.

295
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:04,270
Xiao Wei lent me her boyfriend's scarf.

296
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:09,680
You borrowed her boyfriend's scarf?

297
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,030
Couldn't you have left it out somewhere?

298
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:14,800
Why put it at the very bottom of the storage box?

299
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:18,080
To treasure it? It was also in a present bag.

300
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,810
Also, your phone.

301
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:25,070
Why are her call and message logs completely deleted?

302
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:28,380
I have nothing with her!

303
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,690
You deleted them because of a guilty conscience.

304
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:32,480
Say whatever you want.

305
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,770
Good morning, Dad.

306
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:51,470
Good morning to you, too.

307
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:58,770
Do these Youtiaos taste good?
 (T/N: Youtiao is a common Chinese breakfast food that is made of long, fried dough)

308
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:00,580
Let me try.

309
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:05,490
Mm... They're really good.

310
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:08,300
Did you buy them at the new store?

311
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:15,690
Yuwei, is this soymilk good?

312
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:17,080
Yes.

313
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,830
Cheers!

314
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:24,170
Mm.. It's so good.

315
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:30,810
Dad, can you take me to the Chinese Studies class today?

316
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:35,540
I can't today. Today, I have to work overtime.

317
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:38,740
You work overtime every day.

318
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:42,660
After I'm done with work in a few days, I'll take my annual vacation days.

319
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:46,340
Then we can take Mom on a vacation out of town. How's that?

320
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,740
Yes!

321
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:49,670
Yeah!

322
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,440
Then I'm going to work now.

323
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,770
Okay.

324
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:18,850
I'm going to work.

325
00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:27,870
Listen to Mom.

326
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:29,360
Okay.

327
00:34:58,350 --> 00:35:02,500
Mom, when are we leaving?

328
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,170
Soon.

329
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:25,030
Wait for me.

330
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,000
Sister-in-Law.

331
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,600
Is Liu Yang here?

332
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,120
Teacher Liu Yang went to the construction site.

333
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:41,150
- Where is Wei Yayun? 
 - Wei Yayun seems to have also gone to the construction site.

334
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:01,290
Team Leader Liu, you're here.

335
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:02,870
Thank you.

336
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:10,980
Be careful up there.

337
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,340
Okay. Team Leader Liu.

338
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:22,950
Teacher Liu Yang.

339
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:30,250
Why are you here?

340
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:35,800
Didn't I tell Xiao Lu to take over your work?

341
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,600
There is some work that needs to be handed over on-site.

342
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:42,320
So I will continue to work hard until the last minute.

343
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:46,410
- Where is Xiao Li? 
 - He hasn't arrived yet.

344
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:58,510
Take a break then.

345
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,270
Xiao Wei, come here for a moment.

346
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:29,240
Coming.

347
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:33,550
- What's up? 
 - What's this?

348
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,630
It's here. This one.

349
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:47,690
Xiao Wei? Wei Yayun?

350
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:52,700
I... You are...

351
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:56,460
I'm looking for Liu Yang.

352
00:38:57,210 --> 00:39:00,490
Teacher Liu Yang is over there. I will call him.

353
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,250
Teacher Liu Yang!

354
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:05,990
What's up?

355
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:11,730
Later, install that one, too.

356
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:22,440
Why are you here?

357
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:27,420
You read it before sleeping last night. You left it at home.

358
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:32,910
I brought it for you. I was worried you would need this today.

359
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,140
You guys talk. I will go back to work.

360
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:37,300
Xiao Wei.

361
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:43,860
You gave the scarf back to her, right?

362
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:48,020
I brought it here. I will give it back to her later.

363
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:49,590
Okay.

364
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:58,170
Xiao Wei, didn't you lend me your boyfriend Li Lei's scarf the other day?

365
00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:00,780
Your sister-in-law misunderstood.

366
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,830
Oh.

367
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:10,180
Thank you for the scarf. Sometime soon,

368
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,450
bring your boyfriend to come to our place for dinner.

369
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:18,060
I'm leaving now.

370
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:34,560
Why do you have this cup?

371
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:44,060
Did you give it to her?

372
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:48,010
I? I...

373
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:54,730
Didn't you tell me that there is nothing between you and her?

374
00:40:55,420 --> 00:41:00,480
Xiao Wei, tell your sister-in-law that you bought the cup by yourself. Quickly.

375
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:09,320
Brother Yang, you gave this to me.

376
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:13,730
What else do you want to say?

377
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:16,650
Sister-in-Law! Don't blame Brother Yang. He has done nothing wrong.

378
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:18,900
Shut up!

379
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:24,190
Sister-in-Law, Brother Yang and I couldn't help but like each other.

380
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:28,810
You seduced another person's husband and you are so righteous! How did your parents educate you?

381
00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:32,780
Did they raise you to be a mistress to another person''s husband?

382
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:38,130
- Zhizhi, let's talk back at home. 
 - Is it reasonable to be a mistress? 
 - Why are you saying such nasty things?!

383
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:45,380
You are still protecting her!

384
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:48,050
Are you human?

385
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:49,910
Are you crazy?

387
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:02,510
Hello?

388
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:08,390
Don't cry! What's wrong?

389
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:12,190
Where are you?

390
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:16,350
Siyu! Siyu!

391
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:18,050
Zhizhi.

392
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:25,900
- Zhang Zhizhi, look! 
 - What are you doing?!

393
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:28,790
- When someone slaps you, you slap back! 
 - What do you want to do?

394
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:30,490
Hitting women, what kind of man are you?

395
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:33,550
If you have the skill, fight me 1-on-1!

396
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:36,760
- Siyu, calm down! 
 - Whose side are you on?

397
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:39,760
- Calm down. 
 - Let's figure out what happened first.

398
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,140
Liu Yang, why did you slap Zhizhi?

399
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:44,160
Why do you ask him?

400
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,680
You must apologize to Zhizhi!

401
00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:50,420
I was wrong for hitting her.

402
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:52,500
I apologize.

403
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:58,980
I gave my heart and soul to you.

404
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:02,480
How could you do this to me?

405
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,620
How can you still face me?

406
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:07,880
I didn't do anything.

407
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:11,390
You didn't do anything?

408
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:13,530
You still say you didn't do anything?

409
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:20,500
Did you give her that thermal mug? Did she give you that scarf?

410
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:24,820
How could you do this to me?

411
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:30,260
To say the least, even if I did something,

412
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:34,410
you shouldn't create a scene. How do I face everyone now?

413
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:38,510
You want face? If you wanted that, then you shouldn't have done what you did!

414
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:41,990
I already said I didn't do anything.

415
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:45,690
All right. Everyone, calm down first.

416
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:48,460
I think for this issue, you should make a statement.

417
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:52,780
Pay attention to this in the future. Don't always make Zhizhi worry and confused.

418
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:55,960
Let's both forget about it for now, okay?

419
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:59,010
I can't let it go.

420
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:02,160
If we can't clear this up, I can't continue living with him.

421
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,870
If you can't then don't. If anything, just divorce.

422
00:44:03,870 --> 00:44:06,550
You want to make it big now?

423
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:14,540
Divorce? If we are to divorce, it should be me bringing it up!

424
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:19,800
If we are to divorce, it should be me bringing it up! What gives you the right to bring up divorce?

425
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:22,270
- Why are you crying? 
- Try yelling at Zhizhi again!

426
00:44:22,270 --> 00:44:26,070
All right! All right! Siyu!

427
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:29,070
- Let's go! 
 - Asshole!

428
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:32,870
Calm down a bit. Calm down.

429
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:37,950
