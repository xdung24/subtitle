You can't just let me

125
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,040
Get out of here

126
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,480
I can

00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,160

129
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,240
I can't completely rely on this

130
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:39,519
What are you doing

131
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:42,959
That that

132
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,959
The courier should also

133
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:46,480
It should have arrived yesterday as planned

134
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,800
It's their own problem

135
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,319
and

136
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:52,879
I'm not responsible for this

137
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,439
Yes, the propaganda Xiao Sun is in charge

138
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:55,720
I was forced to resign by you

139
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:57,439
I came up temporarily

140
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,639
no no

141
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,439
Even my fault

142
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:12,920
That's not enough

143
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,000
It's a capital crime

144
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,519
I asked you three times

145
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:16,319
You said it's ok

146
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,639
It turned out to be such a big mistake

147
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:19,040
Who do you die

148
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,360
No no no

149
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,920
Is there a business brochure missing?

150
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:23,439
For this manual

151
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:24,519
I have been busy for a month

152
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:25,920
Ran 13 studios

153
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,360
Four designers mad

154
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,680
Believe it or not

155
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:29,519
I can still use it now

156
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:30,439
A little kid

157
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:31,399

00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,240
I

161
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,039
I'm going to ask

162
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:59,519
It's okay just now

163
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,279
what's up

164
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,200
Deliberately not to let people work overtime

165
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:09,240
Sister Li, Sister Li

166
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:09,960

00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,159
There is good news

168
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:12,039
And a bad news

169
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,279
Which one do you listen to first

170
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:13,919
bad

171
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:14,960
The bad news is

172
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,919
One elevator is broken

173
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:17,200
For safety's sake

174
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:17,879
Just put all the elevators

175
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:18,639
All stopped

176
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:19,480
what

177
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,159
The good news is

178
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,759
Elevator manufacturers promise

179
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:23,720
Ten o'clock tomorrow morning

180
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:24,519

Guaranteed

183
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,799
What about the freight elevator

184
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,759
It broke a few days ago

185
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:31,840
This is also good news

186
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:32,919
Nothing

00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,679

What to do with the investment manual

191
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,480
Put it here first

192
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:39,799
Wait until the freight elevator is ready tomorrow

193

Guests arrive at ten o'clock

196
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,799
Must be before the guests arrive

197
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:46,480
Put the investment brochure in the gift box

198
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:48,279
Two hundred gift boxes

199
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,639
It will take at least two hours

200
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,960
So tonight

201
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,919
Investment manual

202
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:53,960
Put it in the gift box

203
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,960
No, there is no elevator either

204
00:09:58,759 --> 00:09:59,240
Is not

205
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,080
walk the stair

206
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,759
Sister Lee

207
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,000
We are on the twelfth floor

208
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,720
Our company

209
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:08,879
Sister

210
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:10,360
How many times do you have to move

211
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,039
Sister Lee

212
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,799
Why are you so tempered?

213
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,960
Because you don't worry

214
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:29,720
You always

215
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,879
You have such a big temper

216
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,600
After being broken

217
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,519
The temper is so big

218
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:35,360
Guan Xiaotang

219
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:37,039
Do you want to be scolded or beaten

220
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:38,639
I don't want to

221
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:44,600
I am

222
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,440
Want to gossip

223
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,919
Let's relax

224
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,399
No gossip

225
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,399
Then tell me

226
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:53,440
Your ex boyfriend

227
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:55,960
it's said

228
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,639
You two will get married soon

229
00:10:57,639 --> 00:10:58,840
The one who kicked you again

230
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,279
Guan Xiaotang

231
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,399
Don’t you know after the ninth five

232
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,919
Do I have to be measured to my boss?

233
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,320
Not after nine-five

234
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,559
I'm the only one

235
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:09,840
There is nothing i dare not say

236
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,000
There is nothing I dare not do

237
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:13,879
Believe it or not, I will beat you now

238
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:16,159
Keep your strength to climb the stairs

239
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:16,960
sister

240
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:29,960
But but sister

241
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,120
I think you can really

242
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,159
Tell me

243
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,759
Just treat me as a tree hole

244
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:36,320
Nothing is unhappy

245
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:37,639
Just say it

246
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:38,360
Hold your heart

247
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,399
What to do with tumors

248
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,000
roll

249
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:45,759
Then you two

250
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:47,440
How did you meet

251
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:55,080
Talk about it

252
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,399
Say

253
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,480
Talk talk talk talk

254
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:27,559
A little unexpected

255
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:31,440
Like love at first sight

256
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,159
An exhibition

257
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:37,279
They plan and arrange the exhibition

258
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:39,919
do not know either

259
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:41,360
What attracted me to him

260
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,559
Started asking me

261
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:46,679
of course

262
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:48,519
he is handsome

263
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,559
Talented and clean, handsome

264
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:54,519
How handsome is he

265
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,360
Am i handsome

266
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,639
I'll stop talking nonsense

267
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:03,120
Talk about it

268
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,480
All these years

269
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,279
We dream together

270
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,600
Work hard together

271
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,759
We are not only lovers

272
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,759
Best friend

273
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,480
I was in his growth

274
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:52,840
I grew up with him

275
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,080
But we are two people after all

276
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,960
Like a tree

277
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:06,600
Two adjacent branches

278
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,639
Although they grew up together

279
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:12,240
But at some point

280
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:14,360
Suddenly found

281
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,799
We are getting further and further apart

282
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,240
our future

283
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,159
Also pointing in different directions

284
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,919
But he is not willing to compromise

285
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,440
I don't want to give up

286
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:30,200
Break up

287
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,759
Became our only choice

288
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,159
When together

289
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:54,799
Think the other party is redundant

290
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:57,799
In the way cold-blooded

291
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:02,200
Only found out after separation

292
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,080
Half of my body is gone

293
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:14,720
You speak

294
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:16,559
It's very distressing

295
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:24,200
Really

296
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,000
I know

297
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,159
What you said behind my back

298
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,679
We are all nonsense

299
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:36,159
You are all right

300
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:39,279
I can only let myself

301
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:42,759
Very bitter very busy very tired

302
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:46,960
To forget the pain a little bit

303
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,399
I, we are you

304
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:55,279
It's very hard, very busy and tired, okay

305
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:56,320
Li Siyu

306
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,440
What's your boss

307
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,200
Squeeze employees

308
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,200
Heal yourself

309
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,519
Thank you guys

310
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:10,159
Stay with me this time

311
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,960
Have to endure my perversion

312
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,080
Crazy and cold-blooded

313
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:20,320
It's ok

314
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,440
If you know your mistakes, you will be a good sister

315
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,600
I'm afraid I can't change it

316
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:33,799
I

317
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:34,840
I come i come i come

318
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,480
Let let let let me do

319
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:37,919
I

320
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,240
can you

321
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,480
I'm ok i

322
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,559
Go go let go

323
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,039
not me

324
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,840
Then you take one, I take three

325
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:47,440
I

326
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:49,440
My mature hunk

327
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,039
Mature hunk

328
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,519
My mature hunk

329
00:16:58,399 --> 00:16:59,519
not yet

330
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,080
There are five more layers

331
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,200
Told me so much

332
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,960
Also talk about you

333
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:12,200
I

334
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:13,798
What can i say

335
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,599
I ask you

336
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,400
Why is it always the same

337
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:22,880
Heartless

338
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,200
Look like a fool

339
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,839
Possible

340
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:31,279
Because my life experience is too tortuous

341
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,119
I want to have heart and lung

342
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:34,839
I can't live long ago

343
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:39,400
The kid is still in life

344
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:40,720
Really

345
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:43,960
When i was two years old

346
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,440
My dad died in a car accident

347
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,039
My mother remarried

348
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:50,640
I followed my grandpa since I was a kid

349
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:52,160
Grow up together

350
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:53,960
but

351
00:17:54,759 --> 00:17:56,119
My grandpa has no income

352
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,839
Can only rely on picking up

353
00:17:57,839 --> 00:17:58,880
Keep alive

354
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:00,680
Edit

355
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:02,599
I did not make up

356
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:05,440
I feel like picking up

357
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,599
Nothing bad

358
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:08,920
At least you can see

359
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,920
Various game consoles

360
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,119
so

361
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,839
I play games very well

362
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:14,240
sister

363
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:16,119
I still

364
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:18,440
I especially like Transformers

365
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,880
Childhood

366
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:22,400
I picked up my grandpa

367
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,920
Assemble all kinds of Transformers

368
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:26,559
Into this world

369
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,039
Unique Transformers

370
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,720
then

371
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:31,759
On my birthday

372
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:33,440
Give it to yourself

373
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:38,880
When is your birthday

374
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:40,759
I give you a transformer

375
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,920
You lied to me

376
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,480
you guess

377
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,440
Guan Xiaotang, let me kick you here

378
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,279
You can't kick

379
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:56,920
You stop

380
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,720
You chase me

381
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,359
sister

382
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:16,039
You said we are calling

383
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,279
Can it succeed

384
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:20,839
Must succeed

385
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,960
Otherwise sorry

386
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,039
Everything i sacrificed

387
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,359
I'm crawling with you

388
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:29,279
Sixty floors

389
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:33,039
There is hard work without credit

390
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,039
Do I still use the fuck?

391
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,160
No need to

392
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,720
sister

393
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,680
Actually I think

394
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,759
You don't have to be so fierce

395
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:53,000
This first

396
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,400
You are useless

397
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,279
I just do

398
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,440
Second one

399
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:01,119
in fact

400
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,400
I have seen you through

401
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,319
How about you

402
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,079
Serenity

403
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:09,640
Actually, my heart is quite gentle

404
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,519
Ten nine eight seven six

405
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:26,200
five four three two one

406
00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:30,680
I declare

407
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,720
The call is officially online

408
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:42,759
Good good good

409
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,720
Good good good

410
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:03,759
Some people say me

411
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:05,400
Can't make this website

412
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,839
Some people say me

413
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:08,799
impossible

414
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,319
In such a short time

415
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:11,799
Make this website live

416
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,359
But at this moment

417
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,640
All doubts

418
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,119
All become miracles

419
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:20,359
And the creator of this miracle

420
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,119
It's me Li Siyu

421
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,000
This first glass of wine

422
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,240
I respect myself

423
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:30,880
Good good good

424
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,200
This miracle does not only belong to me

425
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,240
Belongs to you too

426
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:47,240
My staff

427
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:49,319
My franchisee

428
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:51,440
You are my partner

429
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:53,319
Also my comrade in arms

430
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,640
Without you

431
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,119
I'm lonely

432
00:23:58,559 --> 00:23:59,319
Nowadays

433
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:01,960
We are all creators of miracles

434
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,200
This second glass of wine

435
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,799
I respect you

436
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,279
it is good

437
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,119
Come on, OK

438
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,000
This way

439
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,240
It's really tough

440
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,319
but

441
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:29,200
With sincere unity

442
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,640
Work hard

443
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:32,559
The spirit of win-win cooperation

444
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,720
Finally have today

445
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,519
And i believe

446
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:39,799
As long as we continue to unite

447
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,720
Work hard, win-win cooperation

448
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,079
We can not only create a

449
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:45,279
The beginning of the miracle

450
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,519
Can create one more

451
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:47,519
Glorious future

452
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:49,880
This third glass of wine

453
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,799
We respect the future together

454
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:53,359
Respect the future

455
00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:04,119
Come i come i come i come

456
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:06,039
Drink less

457
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:07,079
You can drink a little

458
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:08,160
Okay okay

459
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,119
Mr. Li, Lao Bai

460
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:09,559
congratulations

461
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,400
Old white old white

462
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,400
Today's big day

463
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:12,559
Let's drink one

464
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,279
it is good

465
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,039
Mr. Li, let's toast you

466
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,640
Let me drink let me drink

467
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,400
We respect Mr. Li

468
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,200
What are you drinking?

469
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,759
I always make my sister angry

470
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:20,839
I must drink it for her

471
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:21,359
Yes ok

472
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,079
President Pan Siyu congratulations

473
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:26,119
Mr. Pan Mr. Pan Mr. Pan

474
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,400
I know you have been taking care of Mr. Li

475
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,640
I'll have a drink for her

476
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,880
You go

477
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,680
This is the home court between me and Mr. Pan

478
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,599
Good start

479
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,279
But the next line fell to the ground

480
00:25:40,279 --> 00:25:41,400
It's a tough battle

481
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:42,759
How many outlets are there now

482
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,799
Fifteen have been built now

483
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,920
The plan is within three months

484
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,319
Build fifty more

485
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:50,559
All franchisees

486
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,279
Yes

487
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:55,079
Plan to launch several cities this year

488
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:55,920
How many points

489
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,000
The plan is three cities

490
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,720
One hundred points

491
00:25:59,279 --> 00:25:59,920
not enough

492
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,039
At least twenty cities

493
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,119
Eight hundred points

494
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:06,200
I'm afraid of running too fast

495
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:07,599
It will cause problems

496
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:08,759
Siyu

497
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,000
You call

498
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,880
Although very distinctive

499
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,599
but

500
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,720
It is still different from Lubao

501
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:16,519
It has no core technology

502
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,079
Easily copied

503
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,319
If you don't run fast enough

504
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:21,160
Overtaken by others

505
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,319
Then the market is not yours

506
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:25,559
But now the funds are not enough

507
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,839
Emerald can be added

508
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,880
Just waiting for your words

509
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,119
Li Siyu

510
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,440
As an investor

511
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:33,960
Green treasure also needs your performance

512
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,000
President Pan, don't worry

513
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,119
I won't shame you when I call

514
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:38,920
Ok

515
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,920
I believe you

516
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,559
liqueur

517
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,599
coming

518
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:55,319
Guan Xiaotang

519
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,400
Who asked you to change me grape juice

520
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,640
Give me really

521
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:05,400
Child immature

522
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,480
After that

523
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,720
Every dream is realized

524
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,160
We will then

525
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,359
Light a firework to celebrate

526
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:47,839
it is good

527
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:54,240
Mr. Pan, look

528
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:56,359
Within three years

529
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,640
Must be listed on incoming call

530
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,200
Ok

531
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,200
I believe you

532
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,039
She really has this ability

533
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:02,680
Manager Li

534
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,640
We all look forward to that day

535
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,680
Come soon

536
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:05,960
Wait for that day

537
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,279
I must be with all my friends

538
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:09,359
Share the dividends of the Internet together

539
00:28:09,559 --> 00:28:10,319
I promise

540
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,599
OK, then it's a deal

541
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,599
Goodbye

542
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:15,559
Goodbye

543
00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:16,480
Drink less

544
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:18,720
Goodbye

545
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,440
Goodbye

546
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,559
Let's go back

547
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,440
Go back to rest today

548
00:28:45,079 --> 00:28:46,319
Come back tomorrow

549
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:49,039
This battle was fought beautifully

550
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,519
Broke up

551
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:53,519
Why haven't you left yet

552
00:29:58,519 --> 00:29:59,519
Thank you today

553
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:07,640
what happened to you

554
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,240
I kindly pour you grape juice

555
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:13,960
Let you drink less

556
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:14,880
Why are you talking about me

557
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,160
Happy today

558
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,640
If you are happy

559
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:23,920
Take medicine

560
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:29,960
Why did you suddenly become sensible today

561
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,119
I learn it from you

562
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,039
Have a bad temper

563
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:35,319
Also learned from you

564
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:41,599
Sister Li

565
00:30:42,279 --> 00:30:43,759
I really can't drink like that

566
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,680
Guan Xiaotang

567
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:56,319
thank you

568
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:58,440
Don't thank me verbally

569
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,720
If you want to thank me

570
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,920
You can pay me a little bit

571
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,799
Why are you always making money?

572
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,200
Because i am poor

573
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,359
Xiao Tang

574
00:31:10,039 --> 00:31:10,839
Trust me

575
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,359
I will for sure

576
00:31:12,359 --> 00:31:13,319
Take all of you

577
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:14,240
achive dreams

578
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,319
It doesn't matter if I dream or not

579
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:17,559
But ah

580
00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:19,400
Let's not just ninety-nine six

581
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:20,559
Do not worry

582
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,079
From now on we are zero and seven

583
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:25,319
Li Siyu, I want to resign

584
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,480
Only after the call is listed

585
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,720
Isn't it

586
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:35,119
Go back to bed after finishing packing

587
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,279
Have to continue fighting tomorrow

588
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,400
Isn't it

589
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,240
Slow down

590
00:31:55,359 --> 00:31:55,920
Ok

591
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,759
Look good

592
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:14,759
Siyu

593
00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:18,559
The day you succeeded

594
00:32:19,079 --> 00:32:20,920
I will stand at the forefront for you

595
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,359
Cheering and applauding

596
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,319
you must

597
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:33,480
Looking for a wife who treats you well

598
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:36,440
for sure

599
00:33:58,839 --> 00:33:59,519
Wait for me

600
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:07,079
Sign for it

601
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:22,400
Taobao bought

602
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,480
Ok

603
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:25,480
how much did you spend

604
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:27,280
Two hundred yuan

605
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,400
Free shipping?

606
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:29,159
Yes

607
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:33,960
Seven days no reason to return the seller

608
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:34,880
Yes

609
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,159
Send me the link

610
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:37,518
Just our gallery

611
00:34:37,518 --> 00:34:38,759
Can be used at the reception next month

612
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:43,719
Are you not moved at all

613
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,400
If you put these

614
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,760
All changed to diamonds

615
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,599
I was moved

616
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:51,920
You are as real as always

617
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:54,079
You are still as always

618
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:55,280
vulgar

619
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:57,719
Let's go, please supper

620
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,519
I want to break with you

621
00:35:00,519 --> 00:35:01,639
After eating

622
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:21,199
The preliminary layout is basically completed

623
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:22,840
The next step is to implement

624
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,960
No problem, let go

625
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:27,880
it is good

626
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,639
President Wang

627
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:30,159
The people at the aquarium shop are here

628
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,800
Hard work

629
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,199
Still in the original position

630
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:37,199
Be careful, be careful that door

631
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,679
This fish tank is big enough

632
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:59,199
When these fish were first bought

633
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:00,599
It’s only twenty or thirty centimeters long

634
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,599
It's all this big now

635
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:03,960
Have to give them

636
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,360
Change to a bigger tank

637
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:07,239
The fish tank before that

638
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:08,000
Just scrap it

639
00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:12,400
No way

640
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,360
Big fish

641
00:36:15,639 --> 00:36:17,039
Raising small fish in a small tank

642
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:18,039
Have to be suitable

643
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:21,679
These big fish

644
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:24,599
Also need more space to swim

645
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,719
This little tank

646
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:28,280
There will be new fish

647
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:30,880
Right

648
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:39,239
Yiming

649
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:41,800
I want to buy something recently

650
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,960
Can you accompany me

651
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:47,920
I think

652
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:49,880
Your taste, your aesthetic

653
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,840
All pretty good

654
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,519
Can you give me some advice

655
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:54,880
I'm ok

656
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,920
I do not have

657
00:36:56,039 --> 00:36:57,000
You don't want to

658
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:00,480
Yes yes

659
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:04,039
I'll make an appointment with you

660
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:04,920
it is good

661
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:07,960
Then go ahead

662
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,519
OK, I'll go out first

663
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:14,079
Ok

664
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,039
Mr

665
00:38:18,039 --> 00:38:19,840
Please fill in the customer information

666
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,960
Sir your painting

667
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:07,800
Mr

668
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,079
Can i help you

669
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:34,360
This meets the Munsell color scale

670
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:35,320
Thank you

671
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,800
Is he sick

672
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:55,280
I think he wants to pick you up

673
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:56,440
how you said that

674
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,000
He asked me just now

675
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,119
What's your name

676
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,000
Hello there

677
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:01,000
Ask your colleague

678
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:01,920
What is your name

679
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:03,119
Her name is Gu Xiaoling

680
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,199
Married

681
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:06,320
not yet

682
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,519
What happened to her feet

683
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,679
Sprained

684
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,320
What did he buy

685
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,599
untitled

686
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:21,760
Price forty-eight thousand

687
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,480
The one by Agnes Martin

688
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,039
Ok

689
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,800
Is he registered as a member?

690
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,599
registered

691
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,800
I asked again

692
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,199
But your qualifications

693
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,159
It's too bad

694
00:40:41,159 --> 00:40:42,960
People are very embarrassed

695
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,960
Finally there is a place willing to accept you

696
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:49,440
And if you work hard

697
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,000
Is a chance to challenge the high salary

698
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,159
I go

699
00:40:53,679 --> 00:40:54,400
Sales

700
00:40:58,119 --> 00:41:00,199
I know where are you and Mr. Yuan

701
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,360
Used to be somewhat contradictory

702
00:41:03,559 --> 00:41:04,800
More than a contradiction

703
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,760
President Yuan has made it clear

704
00:41:09,159 --> 00:41:10,440
She can accept you

705
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,599
But in public for private

706
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,920
I remind you

707
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:16,800
If you decide to go

708
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,920
Be prepared to be tortured

709
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:23,760
Then you go or not

710
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,639
let me see

711
00:41:29,719 --> 00:41:30,719
Thank you Mr. Hu

712
00:42:32,039 --> 00:42:32,920
Zhang Zhizhi

713
00:42:44,679 --> 00:42:46,159
Have you seen Li Siyu more recently?

714
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:47,760
not much

715
00:42:48,519 --> 00:42:50,599
I heard she opened one called

716
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:51,599
Call

717
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,519
Lao Pan still uses the lowest price

718
00:42:53,519 --> 00:42:54,760
Gave her a batch of batteries

719
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:56,920
I don't know that

720
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,079
You say Li Siyu

721
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:01,719
If Old Pan doesn't support her,

722
00:43:01,719 --> 00:43:02,239
In her life

723
00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:03,440
What can be done

724
00:43:04,519 --> 00:43:05,760
President Yuan, I still have something

725
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:06,719
I'm leaving

726
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,039
and many more

727
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:10,559
I heard you want to change departments

728
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:12,440
Ok

729
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:15,280
My sales department

730
00:43:16,119 --> 00:43:17,000
Welcome

731
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:19,599
I'm afraid I don't have this ability

732
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,039
up to you

733
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:34,559
Hey

734
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,159
what
