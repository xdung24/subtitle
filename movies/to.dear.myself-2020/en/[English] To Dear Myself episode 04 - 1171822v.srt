 [To Dear Myself] 

3
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,800
 [Episode 4] 

4
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,000
Come in.

5
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,300
Sister, the first team's members have already been fully established.

6
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:56,500
There's Huang Bibo, Kuaizi, A Fu, Zhou Zhiyu, Yang Tian, and Zhang Jiaqi.

7
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,040
I got it.

8
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,600
I heard that after we left today,

9
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,000
Sister Yuan brought each of them in, one by one, for a discussion.

10
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
She made them each sign a form saying that they'll follow her.

11
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,300
Really?

12
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,800
So besides you, the top ten salesmen

13
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,100
are all on her team.

14
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:25,900
Sister, were you tricked?

15
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,800
Come in.

16
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,800
Sister Yuan.

17
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,000
You all head out.

18
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,600
- Close the door. 
 - Sure.

19
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,800
- You want to talk to me?
- You purposefully pushed me out

20
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,000
and then approached them one by one to tell them not to pick me, but you.

21
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
These are terrible accusations, what type of person do you think I am?

22
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Then you did not say it?

23
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,600
Do you think I have to do this?

24
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,300
Did your trip go well?

25
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:27,560
I got the contract signed for you.

26
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,270
Siyu,

27
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,100
- didn't you say you wouldn't fight me? 
 - I did.

28
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:38,700
Then, why do you care who picked me and who picked you?

29
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,000
How about this? This commission will be considered yours.

30
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,900
Is it all right?

31
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,900
Liu Yang, time for dinner!

32
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,580
Let's eat dinner. Stop playing.

33
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,800
I'm late, you both eat dinner first.

34
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,000
After you finish eating, you can just leave it here. I'll wash it later.

35
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,600
- Where are you going at this time? 
 - Didn't I tell you yesterday?

36
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,400
I'm going to find Miao Miao's mom and have a meeting with all of them.

37
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,700
- If you leave, what happens to Yuwei? 
 - Aren't you here?

38
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:38,000
- I still have work to do! 
 - But what I'm doing is also work.

39
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,800
Mama, bye!

40
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,800
Bye, sweetie.

41
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,900
That's good enough for now. Thank you.

42
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:57,000
Didn't you say your boyfriend was going to come, too? He didn't come with you?

43
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,500
He's probably on the way now.

44
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,900
Xiaoling was planning on coming too,

45
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,200
but she had work today and couldn't get out of it.

46
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,000
She told me to tell you that

47
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,500
she was very sorry about how big of an impact those events caused you.

48
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,200
- I'm very sorry, too. 
 - It's no problem.

49
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,400
It's not a big deal.

50
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,600
Director Wang, I'm so sorry.

51
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,500
I was a little swamped with work.

52
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,500
- It's okay. 
 - I apologize.

53
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,000
I rushed to get off work as soon as I could, but I was still a little late.

54
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,600
Sister Ziru, thank you,

55
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,000
The proposal you had to solve the problem was very touching.

56
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,500
I said it already. It isn't a big deal.

57
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:44,200
It was clearly our fault. If we made you pay for it, I don't think it would be suitable.

58
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,400
I think it's better if I paid the money.

59
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,000
Exactly, Director Wang. We have felt your kindness.

60
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,600
We hope you will accept this money.

61
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:02,380
I can't possibly accept this.

62
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,700
- Sister Ziru. 
- Even if I did take it, I couldn't have a use for it.

63
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,600
The paperwork has already been taken care of.

64
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,000
I couldn't change it if I wanted.

65
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,400
Just take it.

66
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,600
This way, we would feel a little more peace of mind.

67
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,400
You shouldn't make me feel wrong just to give yourself a little peace of mind, should you?

68
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,610
Sister Ziru, then

69
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,400
we owe you way too much.

70
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,800
It's okay.

71
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,000
Maybe in the future, when I need your help,

72
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,500
you can pay me back then.

73
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,800
I guess so. Thank you, Director Wang.

74
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,500
If you need anything, please don't hesitate to ask us.

75
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,000
Sister Ziru, thank you so much.

76
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,200
Siyu, are you getting busy?

77
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,800
I'm very busy. I have to run even when going to the bathroom.

78
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,400
It's good to be busy. Being busy means that your work is very important.

79
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,200
I think it's because it isn't very important, and that's why the pressure is even higher.

80
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:36,200
Yiming, what are you doing?

81
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,700
I'm in production planning.

82
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,400
That is very interesting.

83
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,400
Yes, it's all right.

84
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,400
What company?

85
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,800
Just a small company.

86
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,800
It's not that small. A finance company. Quite highly ranked in the industry.

87
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,300
I remember last year, the market value was around 800 million.

88
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:58,000
- That sounds about right. 
 - It's all due to his planning activities last year.

89
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,400
Their stock index went up two billion.

90
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,400
That's definitely not true. It's not like it was my work alone.

91
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,200
You're such a promising young man.

92
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,800
He's the company's youngest planning director.

93
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,400
- Okay, can you not talk about it? 
 - It's true though, isn't it?

94
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,500
Excuse me. I have a phone call.

95
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:31,400
- GM Pan.
- I'm asking you. What happened today with the group splitting?

96
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:35,900
It's just... That's what everyone picked.

97
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,000
What do you think?

98
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
- I... 
 - Thank you.

99
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,400
I didn't really think about it.

100
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:51,000
Li Siyu, do you not care about Lubao Batteries?

101
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:11,390
You were scolded by GM Pan again?

102
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,100
It's complicated.

103
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,310
What is it?

104
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,700
Please, this way.

105
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,200
There aren't a lot of people here today.

106
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,000
Yes, today is good.

107
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,100
Let me show you, I ordered a pink diamond!

108
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,400
It's not that busy here today.

109
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,300
Come, this way.

110
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,400
Today's weather is not great.

111
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,000
The landscape is so pretty.

112
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Right, I made the reservation with that in mind. It's very close to the window.

113
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,600
- Wow, you're so good. 
 - Yeah, a special reservation.

114
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,600
- Let's take a look. 
 - What should we order?

115
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,500
Are we drinking alcohol?

116
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,400
My driver didn't drive me today. I drove myself.

117
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,500
- I drove as well. 
 - Then we'll pass on the alcohol. Next time then.

118
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,400
- Want to order one without alcohol? 
 - It's okay.

119
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,700
No, drinking fruit juice is healthier.

120
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,600
So who's writing the proposal this time?

121
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,800
Do you have any recommendations?

122
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,700
Get the freshly squeezed one.

123
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,100
- I can. 
 - You?

124
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,900
Really? Okay, you can do it then.

125
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,400
Sure.

126
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,000
Their family always recommends this.

127
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,800
Okay, then I'll order that.

128
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,600
 [Husband] 

129
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,000
Okay.

130
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,200
When I was the CEO in a foreign company,

131
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,400
I don't like when people in a meeting

132
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,300
were on their phones.

133
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,400
Yuwei's mom, what are you drinking?

134
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,400
I'll have soda water.

135
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,800
If I try my best for the position, I'd be letting down Sister Yuan.

136
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:07,900
If I don't try, then I'd be letting down GM Pan.

137
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:11,470
And at the same time, I'd be letting myself down.

138
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,400
I don't know what I should do.

139
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,400
How did things become like this?

140
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,100
It only happened after I came back from Ningbo.

141
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:37,870
Don't rush to make a decision then.

142
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:40,260
Time waits for no one.

143
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:47,770
I normally decide by flipping a coin. Do you have a coin?

144
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,470
- I didn't bring any coins. 
 - I have one here.

145
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,960
Let's do it like this.

146
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,690
If the picture faces up,

147
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:07,880
then you try hard to get the position of sales director.

148
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,820
If the number is face up, then give up.

149
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:14,060
Okay.

150
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:36,910
It seems it's God's will.

151
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:40,320
No, Siyu.

152
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,450
Actually, the game doesn't tell you what you should do;

153
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:48,160
instead, it lets you know what you really want deep down.

154
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,520
You were disappointed to see the number face up.

155
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,450
It means you never wanted to give up.

156
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,920
Yes.

157
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:08,030
If I were you, I would respect my inner will.

158
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,990
Yuwei's mom, can you finish your plan completely tomorrow?

159
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:28,780
Yes.

160
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,930
How about we discuss tomorrow evening?

161
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:33,860
Still at this place at this time, okay?

162
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:37,200
All right. Let's finish here today.

163
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,570
Waitress, bill please.

164
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:43,660
Hello, ¥1,935.

165
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:50,620
- Send the bill to the group we can split it with you later.
 - Okay.

166
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,640
I sent it.

167
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:58,690
I paid.

168
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,960
- It's quite cold. 
 - Yeah.

169
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:22,790
Your jacket looks very nice when the wind blows it.

170
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:26,090
Does it? I like it as well.

171
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:28,510
You didn't drive, Yuwei's mom?

172
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:30,490
I didn't drive today.

173
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:33,260
I'm too full. I'll take a taxi after walking a little bit.

174
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:36,250
Okay. I will leave first.

175
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,630
Take care. Bye-bye.

176
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,000
Bye.

177
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:53,300
I'm leaving.

178
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,710
See you tomorrow.

179
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:28,000
Liu Yang, you called just now?

180
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,460
What?

181
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:43,630
See you, Director Wang.

182
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,300
I think Sister Ziru understands me.

183
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:04,050
You will try hard to get the position as she said?

184
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:08,280
I... Let me think it over.

185
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:17,610
Sir Chen Yiming, congratulations that you have passed the resume screening of the company's planning director selection. We have planned the time for your interview. 

186
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,920
Who was it?

187
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,910
Nothing. Spam.

188
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:28,060
Spam? You smile so happily!

189
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:31,290
Did I? I am worried!

190
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,320
What are you worried about?

191
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,480
I'm worried about you.

192
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:39,000
I knew nothing about you and Sister Yuan's situation. Nobody told me.

193
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,510
I told you. It came all of a sudden.

194
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:46,410
When I called you in the afternoon, you were angry with me for nothing.

195
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:48,700
Was I?

196
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,390
Was I angry for nothing?

197
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:53,060
Should you tell me if you go to Ningbo?

198
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:57,180
Otherwise, when friends ask me where you are, how can I answer them?

199
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:01,170
I told them that I didn't know. Then, what is the relationship between you and me?

200
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:04,350
All right. You are so busy with so many things.

201
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:07,990
You need to worry about this and that, I just want to save you some trouble.

202
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:10,890
Everything else can be saved.

203
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:16,460
Loving you cannot be saved.

204
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:24,630
If you need to go on a long journey again, you must tell me!

205
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,500
How long is long?

206
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:34,500
The places with housing prices less than ¥30,000 per square meter.

207
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:39,600
Then I have to check the housing price after I arrive at a place. So inconvenient.

208
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:43,080
This is what I mean.

209
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:48,290
Then you should let me think about it.

210
00:17:56,190 --> 00:18:00,420
- How is she? 
 - The anti-allergic treatment has worked.

211
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,850
Observe for a while, after one hour,

212
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:06,960
if she doesn't have any other symptoms flare up, you can go home.

213
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,100
- Thank you, Doctor. 
 - But your daughter had a quite serious allergic reaction.

214
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:14,910
There is such a thing as an EpiPen. You can buy one.

215
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:17,310
If there is an emergency, it can save her life.

216
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,300
All right. I will prescribe it for you.

217
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,330
All right. Thank you.

218
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:29,600
How did this happen?

219
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:36,650
She said she wanted to drink milk. I asked her to get it by herself.

220
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:39,070
How would I know that she'd eat some chocolate?

221
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:42,350
The chocolate is for you when you stay up late!

222
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:46,790
It has peanuts inside so I hid it inside the fridge.

223
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:49,050
How could I know this?

224
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:50,990
Why didn't you watch her more carefully?

225
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:53,900
How could you let her open the fridge by herself?

226
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,460
Why didn't you watch her?

227
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,530
I was busy with something.

228
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:03,050
That counts as something? Waste of time!

229
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:11,990
- Did you tell Mom? 
 - What?

230
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:16,690
- Hello? 
 - Yang!

231
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:19,980
- Mom! 
 - I sent another package of medicine to you.

232
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:22,340
Have you received it?

233
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,190
Yes.

234
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:27,260
Have you finished the one I sent last time?

235
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:32,890
- Almost done.
 - Then continue taking this one.

236
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:35,750
- I know it. 
 - This is for warming the uterus 

237
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,060
That Li Sanwa's wife,

238
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:41,810
it worked really well with her! She had 2 boys in a row!

239
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:45,210
Mom, Zhizhi is right next to me, I'll give the phone to her.

240
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:54,550
- Hey, Mom. 
 -  How's it going?

241
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:56,480
 Have you felt any movement recently? 

242
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,030
What movement?

243
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:01,920
 Maybe you two aren't preparing it correctly. 

244
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:05,700
- How about I come over and make it for you?  
 - No, no, it's okay. We're fine.

245
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,740
 All right, all right. 

246
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:11,480
 Then I'll just wait for your good news then. 

247
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:25,200
My mom wants to come and visit, doesn't she?

248
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:31,080
Never let her come; otherwise, there will be a lot of trouble for us.

249
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:38,730
Why does your mom always want us to have a second baby?

250
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:42,730
The neighbors all have one now.

251
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:46,980
Also, they are all boys so she is jealous.

252
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:50,260
- What do you think? 
 - A second kid?

253
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:52,430
That will kill me.

254
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:56,200
Raising Yuwei already makes it inancially difficult!

255
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,500
When your mom brings it up again next time, tell her the truth!

256
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,890
It's impossible for my mom to listen to me.

257
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:08,100
Do you like the flowers that I gave you?

258
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,850
Yes.

259
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:36,170
May I know which friend sent this to me?

260
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,380
- Your coffee, sir. 
 - Thank you. 
 - You're welcome.

261
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,190
I heard you broke up with Lan Ke?

262
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:09,480
Who told you this?

263
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,600
Someone saw him hang out with a new girlfriend.

264
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,610
I was the one who broke up with him.

265
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:24,070
- Why? 
 - He was too clingy. I couldn't bear it.

266
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:27,370
- Really? 
 - Ask him if you don't believe me!

267
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:43,340
Who's that mystery man who's been sending you flowers every day?

268
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:45,250
I don't know, either. It's annoying.

269
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,760
Is it?

270
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:53,590
New policy. Carry out from the first day of next month.

271
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,360
What policy?

272
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:03,330
The company is really crazy.

273
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:06,290
Gosh!

274
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:08,060
They're even beginning to sell to groups.

275
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:11,460
¥159 for 120 minutes of play and 2 cups of coffee for free.

276
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:14,630
Yeah. So now, can anyone just come in?

277
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:19,550
The membership fee that you bought before for ¥500,000. Now they can play for half a day at ¥159.

278
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:21,310
This is too low.

279
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:24,170
This time even we are also dropping the price.

280
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:28,090
I'm going to study for a Master of Business Administration.

281
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:30,550
What can you learn with your qualifications?

282
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:33,730
At least you can raise your own worth.

283
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:35,900
Hello, waiter.

284
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,610
Coming!

285
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,870
Be careful.

286
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:51,190
- Be careful. 
 - Let's go.

287
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:53,540
Being a team leader, you have so many things now.

288
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:58,170
Printers and paper shredders are all tools you can use.

289
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:01,670
By the way, Sister Siyu, Yuwei's class is going to hold a party.

290
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:03,960
The theme is "I love Mom."

291
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,430
I am responsible for planning, and I made one.

292
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:09,120
But I'm not satisfied. Can you help me with it?

293
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,360
You should find Yiming for this. This is what he does.

294
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,040
You give me the information and I will pass it to him.

295
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,350
Okay, I'll send it to you right away.

296
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:18,080
Sorry.

297
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:22,260
Lin Ling!  From your sales department, right?

298
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:24,900
I know.

299
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,740
I guess, she just finished the resignation procedure.

300
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,550
She's also pretty miserable.

301
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:32,860
Her dad was found with lung cancer and needs money.

302
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:36,990
- How do you know that? 
 - She consulted with me two days ago about medical insurance.

303
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:40,700
Now, it’s not easy to find a job in this big environment.

304
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:06,290
Lin Ling,

305
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:12,590
you want to be in my team. Right?

306
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:18,260
- Yes, but... 
 - Go report to Liu Xiaojia.

307
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:20,340
Just say it was me.

308
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,660
You are now in the second sales team.

309
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,800
Sister Siyu.

310
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:30,890
Sister Siyu, you will offend Sister Yuan if you do this.

311
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:33,190
It's none of her business.

312
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:34,940
Right.

313
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:45,410
Elevator going down.

314
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,250
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

315
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:52,690
I made an appointment for an interview today.

316
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:54,770
- What is your name? 
 - Chen Yiming.

317
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:57,710
Chen Yiming. Please wait here.

318
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:59,500
Okay, thank you.

319
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,840
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

320
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:15,360
- What? She took Lin Ling in? 
 - Yes.

321
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,760
She was going through the resignation procedures. But she paused it again.

322
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,920
Sister Yuan, the person you fired, she called her back again.

323
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,610
Well, what does that mean?

324
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:28,150
The company is about to fire someone,

325
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:30,160
you still want to keep her?

326
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,990
I just want to help her.

327
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:36,500
- So you are doing some good deeds? 
 - Yes.

328
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,560
If you want to do good, then give her money yourself.

329
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:42,870
Let the company give her a basic salary.

330
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:45,980
You want to help her at the company's expense?

331
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:50,140
President Pan, I already told the HR Department,

332
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:52,370
Lin Ling does not occupy the quota of the sales department.

333
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:54,500
I will pay her the basic salary.

334
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,660
Three months.

335
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:07,470
She didn't have a single transaction. What does this mean?

336
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:10,160
This means that she is not suitable for this position.

337
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:14,070
Not suitable for this company. Do you know?

338
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:16,600
I have read her work log.

339
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,580
She has worked hard for these three months.

340
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:21,180
She just lacks a little method and luck.

341
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:24,350
I think if you give her another three months, she will be able to resuscitate.

342
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:27,010
- Impossible. 
 - Why?

343
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:29,840
I am now preparing for equity financing.

344
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,250
Sales revenue in the next three months will determine the company's valuation.

345
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:35,880
So I don't have time for you to train new people.

346
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:39,000
I want data. Continuous rising data.

347
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,980
The data that can bring capital confidence.

348
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:45,210
Then one month.

349
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:47,190
Let her stay if she signs an order;

350
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:50,440
otherwise, I will personally fire her.

351
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:59,200
I know that you are very compassionate.

352
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,680
But the company is about benefits,

353
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,650
it has no place for compassion.

354
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:08,220
I know, but...

355
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:12,220
- I just can't bear— 
 - Li Siyu!

356
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,550
Li Siyu,

357
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,150
sometimes blind kindness

358
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:22,460
to others, to yourself,

359
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:25,690
to the company, and to the overall situation

360
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:28,280
can be extremely irresponsible.

361
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:33,340
I understand, GM Pan.

362
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:35,460
 Chen Yiming!

363
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,560
Hello, Sister Siyu.

364
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:06,540
Sister Siyu, the party related materials are all ready.

365
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:09,010
- When do you need it by? 
 - Tonight.

366
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:10,820
Mothers have to discuss it.

367
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:13,890
Then we have to prepare separately according to the plan.

368
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:16,450
Then, I'll contact Yiming immediately.

369
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,990
You were born after 1980?

370
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:29,570
Correct.

371
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:35,240
Don't underestimate my ability just because of my age.

372
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,430
- Actually I have 8 years' experience. 
 - No, no, no.

373
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:40,250
Our company products are for post-90s.

374
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:43,790
You are a bit old for us.

375
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:47,780
So you think thirties are too old?

376
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:50,010
If your mentality was still young,

377
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:52,900
then we could also consider it.

378
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:58,470
- Your media resources are quite extensive. 
 - Yes.

379
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:02,020
I was one of the first in our circle to recognize

380
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:06,070
- the power of We Media [self-produced media]. 
- We Media is now outdated.

381
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:09,400
Now, all that's in the past. Now everyone in the world is of blended media.

382
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:13,550
You're right.

383
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:16,220
 The number you have dialed is temporarily...

384
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:18,490
Still, no one's answering?

385
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,340
What can we do?

386
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:24,760
I promised Miao Miao's mom that I'd give her the plan today.

387
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:28,950
Miao Miao's mom has a strict sense of time, very principled.

388
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:33,360
If I can't do this, she'll surely be mad.

389
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:37,580
Don't get too anxious. I'll go see him.

390
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:46,550
Did you come up with Caijin's plan for Qingyun?

391
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:48,720
Yes. I designed it.

392
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:53,050
Last year, our company analyzed the case of the Qingyun plan.

393
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:54,740
Really?

394
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:57,330
But if I could re-do that event today,

395
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:59,490
I myself think I...

396
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:03,450
that plan wasn't too complete.

397
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:06,400
True. The plan's foundation is indeed quite good.

398
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,630
But, unfortunately, the planning wasn't too good.

399
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:11,570
If that had been given to our planning team,

400
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:15,500
Caijin Company's value would have increased by at least 500 million.

401
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:21,860
Thank you.

402
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,300
 Zhang Shengyun! 

403
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:01,620
 I called, but you didn't answer or reply to my text. 

404
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:05,820
 I need to talk to you about something urgent. I'm headed to your company right now. 

405
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:11,810
 I need to talk to you about something urgent. I need to talk.... 
 I'm headed to your company right now. I'm headed...

406
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:48,150
- Hello, Yiming. 
 - Siyu, where are you now?

407
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:50,980
 I've parked at the entrance to your company. 

408
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:53,780
Don't go up. I... I'm not at the company right now.

409
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:57,950
- Where are you? 
 - I'm... I'm out speaking with a client.

410
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:00,570
 - Okay. Then I'll come to you. 
 - Okay.  

411
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:18,780
 - Waiter. 
 - Wait just a minute. I'll be right there. 

412
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,250
Siyu, over here.

413
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:51,510
Why are you alone?  Your client?

414
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:53,580
The client left after he ate. He just left.

415
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,380
Waiter.

416
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:00,150
Clear this up.

417
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,300
What's up?

418
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,460
Hurry and help Zhizhi with this plan.

419
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:20,300
- She must have it done before she gets off work. 
 - What's the rush?

420
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:23,500
Zhizhi's in a panic, so I brought it to you.

421
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:35,170
This won't work. I... I... I have two meetings this afternoon and I have an appointment with a client.

422
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:37,870
No matter how important those are, you have to finish this first.

423
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:39,860
This concerns Yuwei's position in her kindergarten,

424
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:43,160
concerns Yuwei's circle of friends, Yuwei's future.

425
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:45,210
You're being too serious about this. It's not that bad.

426
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:47,410
That's what Zhizhi told me.

427
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:55,220
Okay, then. I'll... I'll do this first.

428
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:01,150
Do you want something to drink?

429
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:03,020
I don't want anything.

430
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:17,150
What's wrong? Are you feeling down?

431
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:23,490
Today, I was a little too impulsive.

432
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:26,810
I let an intern that the company was preparing to fire stay at the company.

433
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:28,420
Why?

434
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,570
Her father has lung cancer.

435
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:34,070
Back then, my mom died from lung cancer.

436
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:37,620
I understand.

437
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:41,420
But everyone, including GM Pan,

438
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:43,630
all think I was wrong to do it.

439
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:47,920
Because a company only concerns itself with profits, not compassion. Was I wrong?

440
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,020
 But in every case, it's a human. So we can talk about compassion. 

441
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:52,770
 But a company only concerns itself with profits. 

442
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,030
Siyu,

443
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:06,520
do you know what it is about you that attracts me most?

444
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:09,940
My beauty is unmatched.

445
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:17,860
It's your kindness.

446
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:23,250
I think that your kindness surpasses all other profits.

447
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:30,870
Thank you, Yiming.

448
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:33,040
I know what I should do.

449
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,590
If that girl really can't stay at Lubao,

450
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:43,970
could your company find work for her?

451
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:48,490
It's possible that... I can't help with this.

452
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:51,870
Aren't you always complaining that you don't have enough people in your department?

453
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:56,120
It may be that you...you don't quite understand our circumstances. This year, our company

454
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,180
is doing mass layoffs.

455
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:01,320
Didn't your company have great momentum last year?

456
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,650
That was last year.

457
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:06,130
Now... it's different this year.

458
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,280
I got it.

459
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:16,610
Siyu,

460
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,290
if I were to...

461
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:23,480
- get laid off too... 
 - How could that be?

462
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:27,270
No matter how bad the markets are, we would never be laid off.

463
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:34,580
Why are you so odd?

464
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:37,160
Who? Me?

465
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,560
What would be odd about me? I think you're the one acting odd.

466
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:01,110
 How long will this class take? 

467
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:15,450
Hello, Ma'am. Do you have interest in this field?

468
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:18,710
"For your field of art appreciation

469
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:21,700
and art institution management..." What are the required qualifications?

470
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,950
Do you have a foundation in drawing?

471
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,260
- I do. 
 - Did you bring one of your pieces?

472
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:28,360
Just look at my face.

473
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:31,410
I prepared it myself.

474
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:37,250
- How is your foreign language ability? 
 - I'm okay with French and Italian.

475
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:42,090
- Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Hermes, Prada... 
 - Okay, enough.

476
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,920
Xiaoling.

477
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,140
- Hello. 
 - Where are you going? I'll take you.

478
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:22,760
No, thanks.

479
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:26,740
This is the bustling downtown area. It's not easy to get a cab.

480
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:36,390
It's so windy. Get in.

481
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,030
After you left last time,

482
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:46,350
I actually looked for opportunities to get an appointment with you.

483
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:48,340
I even asked Yiming so many times.

484
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:51,230
That buddy really isn't reliable.

485
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:54,180
He doesn't concern himself with me at all.

486
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:04,070
I can't believe that in this vast sea of people,

487
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:07,040
the two of us would meet each other on the street.

488
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,000
Tell me. Is that destiny?

489
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,800
It makes a person cherish it.

490
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:15,090
- Let's play a game. 
 - Okay.

491
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:18,000
In this game, the first who can't contain stop himself from talking,

492
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,950
starting right now, is the loser.

493
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:23,030
- The loser treats the other one to dinner. 
 - Begin.

494
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:29,840
Xiaoling, I think that this time

495
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,650
you're even more pretty than before.

496
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:35,690
Yo, yo, yo. I lost. I lost.

497
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:37,110
Punish me.

498
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:40,590
Tomorrow, the day after that or the day after that, you choose the place.

499
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:42,770
 Is that guy called Lei-something,  

500
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:44,670
a good friend of Chen Yiming? 

501
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:46,840
- Actually, I haven't had the chance... 
 - Yes. 

502
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,100
- ...to formally introduce myself. 
 - Then, I'll let him live. 

503
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:52,390
I'm Lei Haowen. The "Lei" from "thunder,"

504
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:54,370
the "Hao" from "integrity,"

505
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:56,920
the "Wen" from amazingly "cultured." 
 (T/N: explanation of the characters that make up his name)

506
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:01,960
It could be from that last time, you got a mistaken impression of me.

507
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:07,890
What? That sports car from last time really belonged to you?

508
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:10,670
That sports car really isn't mine.

509
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:12,930
It belongs to our family's housekeeper.

510
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,260
Then, what about this car?

511
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:18,470
Don't look down on this car.

512
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:20,660
Even though it costs only about two or three hundred thousand,

513
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:23,320
I bought it with each penny I earned by myself

514
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:26,160
from my work-study jobs while I was in college.

515
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,820
So, when I can, I often drive this one.

516
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:33,030
It brings to mind the days of my youth.

517
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,010
Even though I'm a "second-generation rich" guy,

518
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:41,550
I don't have the bad habits of that type of person. None of them.

519
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:45,970
- I can see that. 
 - Really?

520
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:50,710
Do you know what the worst habit of the "second-generation rich" guy is?

521
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:52,840
It's their wealth.

522
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:55,010
But fortunately you aren't wealthy.

523
00:41:56,410 --> 00:41:59,480
If you use wealth to judge a person...

524
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:03,360
isn't that behavior a little shallow?

525
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,360
Do you think I'm shallow?

526
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,450
No, no, no. That's not what I meant.

527
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:09,620
You're actually right. I am indeed shallow.

528
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:11,590
People all have their shortcomings.

529
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:13,950
I don't think that's a shortcoming.

530
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:16,460
If a young woman

531
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:19,400
is too vain and seeks material things,

532
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:23,060
it's very possible that they will miss out on some valuable things.

533
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,870
For example?

534
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:29,560
For example, you could lose a man who is

535
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:32,540
truly charming, powerful, and has great potential.

536
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:36,170
I think... based on my base vanity,

537
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:40,140
I'm not worth a guy whose charming, powerful, and full of potential.

538
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:43,210
No. You are worth it.

539
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,540
- What's wrong. 
 - Stop the car. I'm here.

540
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:50,150
Don't you want to go to the subway entrance?

541
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:53,780
I can't take this anymore. I feel nauseous.

542
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,700
Are you carsick?

543
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:02,420
I'm sick of you.

544
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:04,690
How can you say that?

545
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:09,760
Gu Xiaoling, what do you mean by that?

546
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:13,310
If we meet on the street again, I'm begging you not to even greet me.

547
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:16,560
Don't think that just because you're pretty, you can say things to hurt others.

548
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,580
It was you that came after me, that's a legitimate defense.

549
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:23,470
Whoever goes after you deserves to be single forever.

♫  All the punishment given by fate, are you afraid?  ♫

575

♫  Let everything go, all those concerns, real or fake  ♫

576
00:44:57,790 --> 00:45:01,030

577
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:02,570
♫  We are so small yet so determined  ♫

578
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:04,240
