00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,200
[Ep13]

3
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:40,799
Mom, listen

4
00:01:41,025 --> 00:01:44,480
You should get all things, and at the entrance

5
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,858
You will see bus No.106 , ok?

6
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,560
Then mom

7
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,599
You need to take five stops

8
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:52,959
Only five stops

9
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,000
After you get off

10
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,760
you need to cross a zebra crossing

11
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,840
and cross another road

12
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,239
then you will get there, mom

13
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,359
Ok

14
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:05,040
Ok, be careful

15
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,879
Ok, don't worry

16
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:09,559
Yuwei

17
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,800
Be a good girl in class

18
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,439
Do you know?

19
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:15,400
Mom

20
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,360
I want dad to drive me there

21
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,199
Not today, Yuwei

22
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:21,560
I have work to do

23
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,680
Yuwei, be a good girl

24
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:27,050
Dad works very hard

25
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,520
You know?

26
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,439
You can't take her to school?

27
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,439
I want

28
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:34,840
I want to stay with you

29
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,919
I promised those moms

30
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:39,240
I can't stand them up

31
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,479
Ok, let my mom go

32
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,039
Ok... I will go

33
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,520
I'll go

34
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:46,479
Yuwei

35
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,439
Later I will take you to school

36
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,319
I will buy you some candy

37
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,400
Ok

38
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,759
Mom, Yuwei has cavities

39
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,120
She can't eat candy anymore

40
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:04,050
I just say it casually

41
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:08,120
If I don't say so, will she go with me later?

42
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:12,360
Be careful

43
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,599
I know

44
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:18,800
I have to go now, mom

45
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:19,639
Go...

46
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:22,759
Yuwei, good girl

47
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:35,439
Liu Yang

48
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:36,375
Huh?

49
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,159
I'll go by myself

50
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,759
Such a little girl

51
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:52,120
Why let her attend early education class?

52
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,039
Here, drink some water

53
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:56,840
Look at your dad

54
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,240
He used to play with dad chickens and ducks every day 

55
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,080
He learnt nothing

56
00:04:02,425 --> 00:04:04,639
Now he is a top talent

57
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:06,719
Mom

58
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:09,319
Yuwei's living environment is different from mine

59
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:10,400
What's the difference?

60
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,520
I think it's the same

61
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,199
You are wasting money

62
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,919
Zhizhi says, we should raise a girl in a rich way

63
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,800
In a rich way

64
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,199
She is going to drain up your money

65
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,800
Zhizhi

66
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:32,839
Zhizhi

67
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,399
Stop frowning

68
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,279
Come, choose your clothes

69
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,120
Xiaoling, I had the fight

70
00:04:39,675 --> 00:04:41,680
Will I invite troubles for sister Siyu?

71
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,000
You kept talking about this the moment you came in

72
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,199
So annoying

73
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,680
I'm just worried

74
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:48,839
Don't worry

75
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:50,775
Li Siyu is very resilient

76
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:54,200
Well, you need to keep an eye on Liu Yang

77
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:57,160
Zhizhi, come

78
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:00,680
Come, choose yourself

79
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:09,759
How about this?

80
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,399
No

81
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:12,959
Just this one

82
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:14,279
Otherwise you won't have one

83
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:19,839
Is it here?

84
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:21,519
Yes

85
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,639
Hello

86
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,920
We are here to attend class

87
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,680
Yeah

88
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:27,720
Here

89
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,480
Ok...

90
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,360
Come...

91
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,519
Follow the teacher

92
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,360
Hello

93
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,079
Hello, teacher

94
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,680
Hello

95
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,040
What's your name?

96
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:53,439
My name is Liu Yuwei

97
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,519
Hello, this is for you

98
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:57,480
Take it

99
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,920
You are...

100
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,800
I'm her grandma

101
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:04,680
Grandma

102
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:07,120
You need to wait in the waiting area

103
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,199
We are going to start class

104
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,279
Ok...

105
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,839
Yuwei, be a good girl

106
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,279
Don't waste money

107
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,879
Go

108
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:27,120
I outwear it

109
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,439
Harder

110
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:46,040
How's it?

111
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,879
Chest out

112
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:50,959
Shoulders back

113
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:52,920
Relax

114
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,759
Legs out

115
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:54,480
How?

116
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,319
Like this

117
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:56,040
Yes

118
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,040
Legs out

119
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,879
Crotch to this side

120
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:00,600
Belly in

121
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,240
Hurry, belly in

122
00:07:06,925 --> 00:07:11,399
Remember you are not Yuwei's mom now

123
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,199
You are not Liu Yang's wife

124
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:14,959
Let alone the worker in Lubao

125
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,160
You are a beauty

126
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:22,199
Beauty

127
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,920
Look at the skin

128
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,079
So smooth

129
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:31,959
Eyes are so big and bright

130
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,439
Breast

131
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,160
Breast is not as big as mine

132
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:37,680
Waist

133
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,600
The waist is so slim

134
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:41,160
Long legs

135
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:44,399
Right?

136
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,199
Hands down

137
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,160
Look in the mirror

138
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,120
So charming

139
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,240
Is it me?

140
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:55,639
Of course it's you

141
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,199
Well

142
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:01,759
Hand down

143
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,480
Start learning English early

144
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,480
Can't be left behind from the starting line

145
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,480
Sure

146
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,240
Kids need to learn English early

147
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,600
How old is your kid?

148
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,920
Four years and a half months old

149
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:16,800
My kid is four years and eight months old

150
00:08:17,775 --> 00:08:21,120
The class is so expensive 

151
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,000
Over 20,000

152
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,759
So expensive

153
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:24,720
I don't know if the teachers are good

154
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,480
Just ask the kids

155
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,319
If they don't like the teacher, we will ask for refund

156
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,600
Ok

157
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,759
We can apply for refund?

158
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,480
Aunt, you don't know?

159
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,720
If we are not satisfied with the first day of class

160
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,200
we can ask for full refund, over 20,000

161
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,519
Over 20,000?

162
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:54,650
Aunt, you really won't let her finish the class?

163
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:56,440
Maybe you should ask for her opinion

164
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,679
No need

165
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:59,480
I have the final say, full refund

166
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,960
I have to go now

167
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:01,759
Ok?

168
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,960
Zeng, help her with the refund

169
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,600
Ok

170
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,240
Come, aunt, drink water

171
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,000
Ok...

172
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:15,360
Aunt, look

173
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:18,559
You pay Liu Yuwei's tuition with credit card

174
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:20,319
According to the rules, the money will return to 

175
00:09:20,319 --> 00:09:22,279
original account within twenty working days

176
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:23,159
So many days?

177
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:25,639
Yes, it's our rules

178
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:27,320
Fine

179
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,679
Ok, return the money

180
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:29,799
Ok, return the money

181
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:30,519
Ok

182
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,200
Don't worry

183
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,600
The dress, the bag and shoes

184
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,061
I'll return them on Monday

185
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,759
I just keep up appearance with them

186
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,279
You only need to return the dress

187
00:09:43,025 --> 00:09:45,279
You can keep the bag and shoes

188
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:47,440
No

189
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:51,159
I can't take your bag

190
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,240
It's expensive

191
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:53,440
Not expensive

192
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:55,440
How much?

193
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,240
No much money

194
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,320
Look at my bag

195
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,159
58, bought on Taobao

196
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,240
Free delivery

197
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,480
Use this?

198
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:09,120
It can hold a lot

199
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:15,720
Zhizhi, if you don't care about yourself,

200
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,279
others won't care about you, either

201
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,200
You use cheap skin creams

202
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,559
No one will send you expensive cosmetics

203
00:10:21,825 --> 00:10:25,120
So no one will send you Hermes

204
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,519
Who will send me?

205
00:10:33,725 --> 00:10:36,919
And you really need to stop sighing

206
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,840
Don't say negative speech

207
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:40,840
We attract each other

208
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,919
You need to be positive

209
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:50,840
You are right

210
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:53,039
If we think about something bad all the time,

211
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:55,600
it will come 

212
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,799
It's called Murphy's Law

213
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,240
Xiaoling

214
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:04,320
I didn't expect you to know a lot

215
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:09,675
You think I know nothing except beauty and money?

216
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,720
No

217
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:14,039
I never thought about it

218
00:11:14,525 --> 00:11:15,726
It's ok even if you think so

219
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:17,480
When women are jealous of me,

220
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:18,919
it means I am attractive

221
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:21,399
Right?

222
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:24,519
I'll get it

223
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:47,879
Gosh

224
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:50,759
Yuwei, come here

225
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,840
Do you like it?

226
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:56,879
Come, drink some milk

227
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,480
Here is better than early classes

228
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,440
Aunt...

229
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:01,840
Sorry

230
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,360
They can't eat inside

231
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,399
In case they will get suffocated

232
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:06,279
I get it...

233
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:06,960
I'm sorry

234
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,840
Thank you...

235
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,360
Yuwei

236
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,200
Let's go over there

237
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:16,759
Is that your son?

238
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:19,720
So naughty

239
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:30,600
Yuwei

240
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:31,799
Come here

241
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,440
Come here

242
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,679
She pushes you

243
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:39,879
Why don't you push her?

244
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:40,639
Are you stupid?

245
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:41,600
Go, push her down

246
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,320
Go, push her

247
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:45,960
Push her...

248
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,000
Push her

249
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,000
Why does she push my daughter?

250
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:54,080
Your daughter pushed my granddaughter first

251
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,080
Did you see it?  Are you blind?

252
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,159
But you can't teach kids to fight

253
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,200
Who fought?

254
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,120
You didn't teach your daughter well

255
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:00,679
Who fights?

256
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,759
How can you say so?

257
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:03,279
You...

258
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,279
Stop it...

259
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:06,679
We are here for fun

260
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:07,399
What the hell

261
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:08,159
Stop it

262
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:10,159
You are so great?

263
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,320
Undereducated

264
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,600
Who is undereducated?

265
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,240
Stop it -Go

266
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,440
Don't play with the idiots

267
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,600
Right? Let's go

268
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:17,759
Forget it...

269
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:19,080
Look, so ridiculous

270
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:19,799
Forget it

271
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,279
Idiot

272
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,440
Baby, come here

273
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,080
You need to be fierce

274
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,320
Don't be a wimp like your mom

275
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,360
Good for nothing

276
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:29,900
Look good, right?

277
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,320
Miaomiao's mom, sorry we are late

278
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:32,960
It's ok

279
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:34,919
Let me tell you

280
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,200
I tried the dress last night

281
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,519
I gained weight recently

282
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:39,559
I outwear it

283
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:40,320
Really?

284
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,519
I am going to wear cheongsam

285
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,440
I am going to wear a cheongsam too

286
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:45,759
Hope we won't wear the same one

287
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:46,759
Yes

288
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:52,360
Doudou

289
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,159
Why is he here?

290
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:56,960
Go

291
00:13:57,886 --> 00:13:59,886
Doudou, be a good boy, let's go home

292
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:06,100
The teacher told me principal told Doudou not to come ever

293
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:06,879
Really?

294
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,639
Our joint letter works

295
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:10,919
Yes, definitely

296
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:13,286
Doudou, let's go home

297
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,759
Put that down

298
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,960
Put that down, ok?

299
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:20,879
The more I look at them, the more annoying it becomes

300
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:21,639
It's ok...

301
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,600
The car is coming

302
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,360
Let's get in the car

303
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,360
Go...

304
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,519
You first

305
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:26,519
Help me hold this

306
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:27,399
I have got too much

307
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:28,159
Let me help you

308
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:29,840
Over there

309
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,639
Doudou, did you hear me?

310
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:37,919
The left one

311
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:39,200
Yeah, the left one

312
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,519
The door sucks

313
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,919
Stop it

314
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:43,320
Let's go home ok?

315
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,559
Come...

316
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:55,200
He is so naughty

317
00:14:57,759 --> 00:14:59,200
What color is your cheongsam?

318
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,600
Green. What about you?

319
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,799
Mine is blue

320
00:15:02,675 --> 00:15:05,225
But I will have a crystal brooch

321
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:06,759
Crystal...

322
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,679
I...

323
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,279
What color earrings do I use?

324
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,279
Golden

325
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:12,320
Golden is great

326
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,600
Is golden ok?

327
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,600
It looks great with green cheongsam

328
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,399
Ok, it depends on how you match

329
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:36,679
Sister Siyu

330
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:39,840
They give the tender of municipal lighting project to sister Yuan

331
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,480
What?

332
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:41,679
Client department told me this

333
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,679
Lighting project tender is mine

334
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:50,879
Why do you give it to sister Yuan?

335
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,720
Because she filed it first

336
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:54,480
Come on, please take a look

337
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,080
Obviously I filed first

338
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,080
I'll check it for you

339
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:06,840
Yuan Huizhong filed on 10th

340
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,200
It's clearly written here

341
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:09,679
Impossible

342
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,519
Xiaojiao

343
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:16,159
Please help me to check the filing

344
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:17,279
Which one?

345
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:19,320
Sister Yuan's street lamp tender

346
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,080
Sister Yuan's filing time is the tenth

347
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,879
Impossible

348
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:32,960
Xiaojiao

349
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,519
We checked it days ago

350
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:36,279
It's 16th, right?

351
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:40,440
I forgot it

352
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:42,320
You checked it for me

353
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,559
How can you forget?

354
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,279
Every day so many people come to register for file and check it

355
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:47,200
How can I remember all?

356
00:16:59,120 --> 00:16:59,879
I get it

357
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,080
Did you find it out?

358
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,319
Client department says

359
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:07,359
They haven't touched any data

360
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,725
The network department didn't find any tampering

361
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,839
Security department checked all the monitorings

362
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:16,559
Everything is normal

363
00:17:17,358 --> 00:17:18,558
Can I check it myself?

364
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,839
Is this necessary?

365
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:25,561
So she will go on behalf of our company

366
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:27,039
You think it's you?

367
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:13,880
Sister Siyu

368
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:16,240
You should have taken a picture

369
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,400
I didn't see this coming

370
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:24,240
Last time the reimbursement

371
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:26,950
You should know who they are

372
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:28,640
I underestimated the enemy

373
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:33,160
What are you going to do now?

374
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:36,920
I surrender

375
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,960
Now?

376
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,321
If it's only one million, I can defeat her

377
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,920
But if she gets the order

378
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,720
28 million

379
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,400
I will have no chance

380
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:52,250
So she will be the sales director?

381
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,839
I have to leave Lubao

382
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:11,900
Maybe even you have to go

383
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:22,200
Sister Siyu, listen

384
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:23,559
I have an idea

385
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:27,680
Liu Yang won't let Lubao win the tender

386
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,920
Yuan Huizhong won't get the order

387
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,200
Then you still have a chance to win

388
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:36,079
Impossible

389
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,279
Why?

390
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:38,799
First

391
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:40,680
President Pan needs this order

392
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:45,039
He will have an ace with this order

393
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:46,319
Second

394
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,680
It is unfair

395
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,480
Liu Yang will violate the rules

396
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,640
Sister

397
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:36,960
Chen

398
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,839
Your rent is due next month

399
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:40,759
Will you go on renting?

400
00:21:41,475 --> 00:21:43,480
I need to increase the rent

401
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:45,759
How much will you increase?

402
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,680
Not much

403
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,640
Increase by 15%

404
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:50,759
Hello

405
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:53,759
Hello, how about it? Chen

406
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:57,480
So much

407
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:00,559
If you want to renew the lease,

408
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,039
you need to transfer me all the money for next quarter

409
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,119
22,000 in total

410
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:07,875
If you want to move out, I will come to collect the house next month

411
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,960
Ok, I get it

412
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:33,640
Brother Yiming

413
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:36,279
Siyu has some problem in the company

414
00:22:36,279 --> 00:22:37,519
She has a bad mood now

415
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,079
You should go to see her

416
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,160
You didn't answer my calls

417
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:50,079
So I am here

418
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:19,000
It's ok

419
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,000
Since president Pan talked to me

420
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:01,025
I survived open and covert attacks and slander

421
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,825
I think I will be the sales director for sure

422
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,799
But who knows?

423
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:16,240
How to get the order

424
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,400
How to bring a team

425
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:20,119
I don't think I lose to sister Yuan

426
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,359
But in some ways

427
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,525
I will never be sister Yuan's opponent

428
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,519
I failed, but you are happy

429
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:41,759
No

430
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,440
Or you are laughing at me

431
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,319
Laughing at you?

432
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:49,599
For what?

433
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,119
I am a loser now

434
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:53,759
How could I laugh at you?

435
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,160
Then why are you laughing?

436
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:01,759
Siyu

437
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,519
Come back to my hometown with me

438
00:26:05,319 --> 00:26:06,440
How could this be possible?

439
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,119
Before I came, I called Zhu Xiaobai

440
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:12,319
I told him about what happened recently

441
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:15,676
He told me he needs a sales director

442
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:19,240
Chen Yiming, what are you thinking about?

443
00:26:20,125 --> 00:26:22,319
Now things become like this

444
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,119
After she becomes the sales director,

445
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:26,079
you will leave Lubao

446
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:28,039
I can go to other companies

447
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,160
With my ability and resources

448
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,519
I can find a job so easily

449
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:34,240
I thought so two months ago

450
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,000
I was as confident as you

451
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:37,440
Is that useful?

452
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:44,625
Now I even want to be a copywriter

453
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:47,440
But no company hires me

454
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,799
President Guo needs you

455
00:26:51,025 --> 00:26:52,680
Can we stop talking about this?

456
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:15,359
Really

457
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:23,350
Only after you lose your job,

458
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:30,050
you will find the market is different from what you imagine

459
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:35,278
You are not the one as you think

460
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,345
Sister Ziru asked us to have dinner with her

461
00:27:58,279 --> 00:27:58,960
I won't go

462
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,759
I have a video conference with Zhu Xiaobai

463
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,440
You really want to go?

464
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,839
The little confidence is all I have now

465
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,799
And a little bit of self-esteem

466
00:28:17,875 --> 00:28:20,839
I want to keep them

467
00:28:21,725 --> 00:28:26,725
I don't want to consume them in Shanghai

468
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,640
I will consume without producing

469
00:28:29,975 --> 00:28:33,350
If it's the case, I should step backwards

470
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:35,160
I will have a broad sky

471
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:36,279
Right?

472
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:02,920
Xiaoling

473
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:05,039
You have so much luggage

474
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:07,400
You have over 80 pairs of shoes

475
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,279
Are you a centipede?

476
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:09,240
Can you wear all of them?

477
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,160
None of your business

478
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:13,250
I buy shoes with my money

479
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,319
What are you doing?

480
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,279
I have to get in your car

481
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:20,440
These are my treasure

482
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:23,599
I didn't promise to send you to your new home

483
00:29:30,279 --> 00:29:31,559
Or you can beg me

484
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,279
I will help you out of kindness

485
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,240
Beg me...

486
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,519
Fine

487
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:45,880
I will help you out

488
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,240
Come, seat belt

489
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:48,960
I will do it myself

490
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:10,319
This is the last one

491
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,480
I'm exhausted

492
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:23,599
Just so little

493
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,519
So little?

494
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:30,039
You have 20 catties of cosmetics at least, right?

495
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,075
Let alone your shoes and bags

496
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:34,880
Enough

497
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,680
I'll invite you to dinner later

498
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,400
Ok?

499
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:43,240
We won't eat out, right?

500
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:46,839
We can eat here

501
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:49,600
You can cook some specialty dishes for me

502
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:51,599
Ok

503
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,559
My specialty is boiled water

504
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:58,960
Well, we should eat out

505
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,759
Ok, you can name the place, I will pay the bill

506
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,839
You go out first

507
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:06,240
I need to get changed

508
00:31:06,625 --> 00:31:08,920
You can just get changed up there

509
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,559
I won't peek 

510
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:10,599
I will close my eyes

511
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:12,640
Hurry, get out

512
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,400
Believe me

513
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,240
I won't peek

514
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,240
I need to get changed, get out

515
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,000
No...

516
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,119
If I go out now, people will think I am a stealer

517
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:20,279
You can get changed in bathroom

518
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,359
I helped you move out

519
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:29,599
You should be nice to me

520
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:40,119
Xiaoling

521
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:44,680
We'll go to the roadside stall later

522
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:46,839
Not Michelin

523
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:50,250
Don't wear high heels of ten centimeters

524
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:51,839
Eight centimeters will do

525
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,240
And don't take expensive bags

526
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,425
Chanel Gucci

527
00:31:58,039 --> 00:32:00,225
If it gets oil, you will throw the tantrum

528
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,839
You go out with me like this?

529
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:07,960
What's wrong?

530
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,680
So casual

531
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:13,319
Usually you will do the makeups

532
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,319
It depends on whom I go out with

533
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:16,759
It's not necessary when it's you

534
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,519
Gu Xiaoling

535
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,119
You won't get married if you are so snobbish

536
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:20,799
None of your concern

537
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:23,240
If I don't care about you, you can't get married

538
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:25,160
Anyway, I won't marry you

539
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:27,440
Go

540
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,039
Let me tell you

541
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:32,880
Why are you so naughty?

542
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,720
Hurry

543
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,480
Siyu

544
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,200
Have a good appetite

545
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,359
I ordered a soup for you, it's good for your stomach

546
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:01,920
Sister Ziru

547
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,319
You know I have a poor stomach?

548
00:33:05,799 --> 00:33:08,559
If a saleswoman has a good stomach, 

549
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:09,680
her sales performance will be poor

550
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,400
You know me

551
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:14,200
Drink while it's warm

552
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:28,920
Siyu

553
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:31,559
I remember president Pan told me last time

554
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:35,200
Another two companies are talking about equity financing with him

555
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,880
What are those companies?

556
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,480
I just can't remember them

557
00:33:45,319 --> 00:33:46,400
I am forgetful from time to time

558
00:33:49,775 --> 00:33:51,720
He didn't tell you about these two companies?

559
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,759
We only talk about sales

560
00:33:56,279 --> 00:33:59,125
He barely talks about financing with me

561
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,880
After we met last time

562
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:06,720
What did he tell you?

563
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Nothing at all

564
00:34:16,518 --> 00:34:17,399
Is the soup delicious?

565
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:19,800
Not bad

566
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:27,000
You don't have a good mood today

567
00:34:28,175 --> 00:34:30,519
Did you contact the people on the list I gave you last time?

568
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:40,719
Three of them have cooperation intentions

569
00:34:41,225 --> 00:34:42,239
Great

570
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:43,880
Your sales performance has no problem, right?

571
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:48,559
What's wrong, not enough?

572
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,079
It's ok

573
00:34:50,425 --> 00:34:52,079
I will tell Annie to give you more

574
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:56,440
Sister Ziru, thank you

575
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,900
I won't need your client list

576
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,880
What's wrong?

577
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:11,100
My competition with sister Yuan is over now

578
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:12,840
It's three months, right?

579
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,360
It's not the deadline

580
00:35:16,039 --> 00:35:17,320
But I have lost

581
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:18,719
Why?

582
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,039
Be careful

583
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:22,400
Come in, please

584
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:24,239
I need all the special dishes

585
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,599
Ok, what kind of hotpot condiment?

586
00:35:25,639 --> 00:35:26,320
Slightly spicy

587
00:35:26,519 --> 00:35:27,480
Extra spicy

588
00:35:27,519 --> 00:35:28,519
Four beers

589
00:35:28,519 --> 00:35:29,239
Ok

590
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:35,000
Only two of us, four bottles?

591
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:36,880
I just ordered my own beer

592
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,039
You need to order if you want to drink

593
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,679
Great

594
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:45,960
What are you looking at?

595
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,280
You have never seen a beauty like me?

596
00:35:56,639 --> 00:35:58,400
Are you Gu Xiaoling?

597
00:35:58,719 --> 00:35:59,719
What does it mean?

598
00:36:00,679 --> 00:36:01,880
Oh my god

599
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,360
You are not the one I know

600
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,559
What should I be?

601
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,639
You are a goddess in my heart

602
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,960
Today you are...

603
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,719
Think it clearly before you say it out

604
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,679
Otherwise I'll stab you

605
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:19,850
I mean usually you are so aloof and detached

606
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:21,559
Why are you so unrestrained today?

607
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:23,280
Comfortable

608
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:27,119
I feel so comfortable today

609
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,750
Amazing

610
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:33,875
Usually I am surrounded by fair-skinned, 

611
00:36:33,875 --> 00:36:35,075
rich and beautiful ladies

612
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:36,239
But I don't feel a thing

613
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:39,119
Because they can't make me confortable

614
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,119
Stop pretending

615
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,159
You pretend you are a rich son every day

616
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:44,039
Aren't you tired?

617
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:48,519
Yeah, I'm very tired

618
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,840
You don't know how tired I am

619
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,679
Every day when I'm lying in bed

620
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:55,199
I need to review the past and learn the new

621
00:36:57,075 --> 00:37:01,519
I need to think if there are any loopholes of the line that day

622
00:37:02,675 --> 00:37:05,559
What kind of story I need to make up next day

623
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:07,960
So you say, am I tired?

624
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,679
Do me a favor

625
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,719
Can't open a beer?

626
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:18,639
Amazing

627
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:27,150
And in the field of new energy battery

628
00:37:27,719 --> 00:37:30,400
almost no one can outcompete Lubao

629
00:37:30,425 --> 00:37:32,425
 in terms of cost and performance

630
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,500
So no matter who goes, our company will win the bid

631
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:53,650
Siyu, I don't think your competition with Yuan Huizhong is over

632
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,159
It's settled after president Pan saw me

633
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,000
You think I still have hope?

634
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:02,800
Everything is possible

635
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:09,250
With my experience, I won't surrender until the last moment

636
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:12,840
And I will have the chance to turn the table

637
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,199
Sister Ziru

638
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,119
What should I do?

639
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:25,659
Tell me why do you lose to her?

640
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,639
I don't think I am not as capable as her

641
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,679
I lose because I am indecisive

642
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,599
In fact, it is soft-hearted

643
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:39,400
Siyu

644
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,039
You have a wrong idea

645
00:38:42,039 --> 00:38:43,320
I need to correct you

646
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:47,875
Decisiveness is vital

647
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:48,840
Right?

648
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:52,360
A little girl is soft-hearted

649
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:54,719
It's because she is kind and compassionate

650
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:56,199
She cherishes friendship

651
00:38:57,079 --> 00:38:58,239
It's a good advantage

652
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:03,300
But in the workplace especially for managers

653
00:39:04,025 --> 00:39:05,199
it's not an advantage

654
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:07,559
The workplace speaks by performance

655
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,225
And performance depends on shrewd and calm mind

656
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,840
And decisiveness

657
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,519
You mean...

658
00:39:17,159 --> 00:39:18,960
I'm not professional enough

659
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,519
At least when competing with sister Yuan

660
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,400
you are so soft-hearted

661
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,280
Then you made a mistake

662
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,400
But...

663
00:39:29,275 --> 00:39:31,475
People have feelings

664
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:35,079
But mature people will be more rational

665
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,840
You only care about your friendship

666
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,000
rather than company's development

667
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,250
You only see sisterhood

668
00:39:42,775 --> 00:39:44,840
You even don't care about your subordinates' future and job

669
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:50,960
Siyu

670
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:54,079
Actually, the sensibility is not bad

671
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:57,721
But to be an excellent professional manager

672
00:39:58,025 --> 00:40:00,480
you need to stay calm and decisive

673
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:02,079
For the development of the company

674
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,239
For career

675
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,480
You even need to be cold-blooded

676
00:40:05,725 --> 00:40:07,880
Then you can go higher and farther

677
00:40:10,679 --> 00:40:11,440
Sister Ziru

678
00:40:12,325 --> 00:40:16,050
I don't know if I can make it

679
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:19,719
If you want to realize your dream

680
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:23,000
you need to work hard in this direction

681
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,840
You will feel painful

682
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,519
But in the end you will benefit from it

683
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:37,400
Surviving in the workplace is actually very simple

684
00:40:39,175 --> 00:40:41,960
Do what you should

685
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,960
Don't fail the company

686
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,280
Don't fail your efforts

687
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:01,800
Need more?

688
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,199
Waiter, I need large intestines

689
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,119
Ok

690
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:09,400
What'?

691
00:41:11,075 --> 00:41:13,840
Large intestines don't fit your temperament

692
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,599
but I like it

693
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:17,800
I can tell you

694
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:20,079
I like large intestines since childhood

695
00:41:21,775 --> 00:41:25,175
You are heavy-flavored

696
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,639
All because of my dad

697
00:41:27,825 --> 00:41:31,440
My dad took me to eat large intestines each week in childhood

698
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:34,719
I will take you to eat Shanghai's best brine intestines

699
00:41:35,825 --> 00:41:37,760
But he died when I was 8

700
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:44,280
When did your mom marry Li Siyu's dad?

701
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,679
When I was 12

702
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:51,350
Actually my stepdad treats me and my mom well

703
00:41:53,320 --> 00:42:02,500
Mainly because we used to live a poor life

704
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,039
We had no money

705
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:12,679
I wish I could meet you at that time

706
00:42:15,225 --> 00:42:17,400
The one I wished to meet is not you

707
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:18,360
Who?

708
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:22,320
I loved Meteor Garden in childhood

709
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,079
I think I am Shan Cai

710
00:42:24,239 --> 00:42:26,050
I wait for my Dao Mingsi every day

711
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:28,639
Guess what I watched in childhood

712
00:42:29,239 --> 00:42:30,119
Doraemon

713
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:30,960
No

714
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:34,039
Young and Dangerous

715
00:42:35,175 --> 00:42:37,679
The film is my dream in life

716
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:39,400
You have a dream?

717
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:41,599
Of course

718
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,119
I want to make big money

719
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,280
Be a big brother

720
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,239
Now I think it's so silly

721
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,039
But at that time I made an oath

722
00:42:48,039 --> 00:42:50,920
If I succeed, I will go to Macau

723
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:54,360
I will be on a spree

724
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:56,280
Wish your dreams come true

725
00:42:57,519 --> 00:42:58,440
Cheers, to dreams

726
00:42:59,000 --> 00:42:59,679
Cheers

727
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:14,039
President Liang, sorry

728
00:43:14,039 --> 00:43:15,320
I call you back so late

729
00:43:15,719 --> 00:43:16,719
Don't worry

730
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:19,360
I will handle your shipping properly

731
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:20,239
Manager Tang

732
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,159
I have sealed the contract

733
00:43:22,450 --> 00:43:23,691
It can be sent tomorrow

734
00:43:23,691 --> 00:43:25,800
I invite you to dinner when you come to Shanghai

735
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,000
Mr. Xu

736
00:43:27,159 --> 00:43:28,360
Sorry

737
00:43:28,599 --> 00:43:29,880
I was busy yesterday

738
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,440
So I didn't have time to reply you

739
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,360
If it is convenient for you tomorrow

740
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,480
I will go to see you 11 o'clock in the morning

741
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,679
Ok, see you tomorrow morning

742
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:44,719
Zhu Xiaobai called

743
00:43:44,719 --> 00:43:46,559
He asked me when we could go back

744
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:48,800
What's your decision?
