[To Dear Myself]

00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:33,100
[Ep15]

3
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:50,920
Liu Yang...

4
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,920
Liu Yang, what are you doing?

5
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,879
Go home

6
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,959
The party is not over yet

7
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,000
I didn't study in the U.S.

8
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,840
I'm not the director, either

9
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,159
I am from a rural party

10
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:02,359
I don't deserve to attend this kind of party

11
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:04,599
I just say it casually

12
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:06,120
It's all your vanity 

13
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:08,080
If I don't say like that

14
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:10,520
they will look down on Yuwei

15
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,500
But do you consider my feelings?

16
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,599
She knows our director

17
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:17,700
What if our director knows this?

18
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,919
What I said is correct

19
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,080
You studied in the U.S.

20
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:24,879
And you will be the director soon

21
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:27,800
Zhang Zhizhi

22
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,960
Wake up

23
00:02:30,825 --> 00:02:32,520
We are not in the same circle with them

24
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,280
You still want to kiss their ass

25
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:36,159
You don't feel a thing

26
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:38,080
But I am sick of it

27
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,080
Liu Yang

28
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:01,560
Come, baby

29
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:03,719
You are back

30
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,240
Grandma, look

31
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,240
I got the present today

32
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:11,240
You got a present? Let me see

33
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,000
Mom, is Liu Yang back?

34
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,199
Yes, in his room

35
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:18,639
Its tail can move

36
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:19,240
Really?

37
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:19,680
Mom

38
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,919
Help her take a shower

39
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,520
Ok...

40
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,600
Come...

41
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:39,439
After you left

42
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:43,199
we met a teacher of etiquette in Buckingham Palace

43
00:03:43,475 --> 00:03:45,599
She teaches all kids about royal etiquette

44
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,280
If Yuwei doesn't come to the circle,

45
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,159
she will never learn this

46
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,960
We are an ordinary family

47
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:56,719
But our daughter should be better than us

48
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,084
At least we should motivate our daughter from childhood

49
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,000
And, let me tell you...

50
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:26,240
She asked for it

51
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:26,920
Sister Siyu

52
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:29,150
We know sister Yuan's punishment

53
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,279
What?

54
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:31,040
Fire her

55
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,439
Sister Siyu, you are here

56
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,199
Sister Siyu

57
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,680
You look so good today

58
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,879
What are you talking about?

59
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:39,519
Sister Siyu looks good every day

60
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,480
You two are so honey-mouthed

61
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:44,639
Sister Siyu

62
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,319
Let's have a party to celebrate it

63
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,480
Celebrate what?

64
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:49,079
You are sales director now

65
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:50,120
No

66
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,199
It's a matter of time

67
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,360
No...

68
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,000
Li Siyu

69
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,879
Congratulations

70
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,800
Sister Yuan

71
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,120
Congratulate you on your promotion

72
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:16,600
And I hope the higher you climb, the worse you fall

73
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:20,399
Pan Zhiyong backs you up

74
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:22,079
So you think you have nothing to fear?

75
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,839
I can tell you

76
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,000
I can't teach you a lesson

77
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,079
Someone will

78
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:31,519
Li Siyu

79
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:32,959
You will see

80
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:35,519
You will cry one day

81
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,360
Go away

82
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,720
Go away

83
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:04,959
Go away

84
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:08,360
Get away from me

85
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:30,800
Siyu

86
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,360
Siyu, president Pan wants to see you

87
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,360
Now?

88
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:34,920
Yes

89
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:38,639
Come with me

90
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:44,720
Hurry

91
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:49,600
Sister, leave the bag to me

92
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:50,800
Thank you

93
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,839
President Pan

94
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,120
Sit

95
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:20,350
Next Monday, HR department will announce officially

96
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:23,600
you will be the sales director

97
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:43,720
Now I have to tell you the secret

98
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,959
Our company has reached a point where its very existence is at stake

99
00:07:50,225 --> 00:07:52,319
We are selling well, right?

100
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,839
But we make no much money

101
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:54,959
Why?

102
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:59,950
Because years ago, we have dividends of policy in this area

103
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:03,830
Since last year, they have cancelled it

104
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,920
Our sales is in stalemate

105
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,279
And technology hits a bottleneck

106
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,519
We are facing capital chain rupture

107
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,120
This is the status quo of Lubao

108
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:17,079
You are preparing for equity financing, right?

109
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:17,759
Yes

110
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:22,525
But Tianyi, Huaan and Shanghai Bank

111
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:24,850
They all have a request

112
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:28,325
We need to double Lubao's sales revenue

113
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:29,800
Double?

114
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:31,040
Yes, double

115
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,120
In other words, in three months

116
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,000
we need to make 500 million

117
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:37,678
Impossible

118
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:51,879
Fifteen years ago

119
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:53,480
I told them

120
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:56,950
I want to break U.S. and Japanese monopoly

121
00:08:57,799 --> 00:09:00,600
I want to be China's own new energy enterprise

122
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,919
They also said it was impossible

123
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,759
But you made it

124
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:04,919
So anything is possible

125
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:05,960
It depends on wheher you fight or not

126
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,879
Siyu, will you fight or not?

127
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,960
Yes, I will

128
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,679
Very well

129
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:19,879
I see you right

130
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:21,799
Tell you more

131
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
It's hard now

132
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,200
Really really hard

133
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,879
But the future is beautiful

134
00:09:27,825 --> 00:09:31,240
Lubao's valuation is unlimited after this

135
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,200
Believe me

136
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,175
Within five years, Lubao will be listed

137
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,350
Within ten years, Lubao will be No.1

138
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:43,175
Within fifteen years, Lubao will be No. 1 in the world

139
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,000
I believe

140
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,480
I don't believe believe

141
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:48,639
I only believe in hard work, Siyu

142
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:51,080
Fight with me

143
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,519
Lubao will never let us down

144
00:09:53,975 --> 00:09:56,720
We will be top 1 in the world

145
00:09:59,075 --> 00:10:03,425
Till then, we will go on stage 

146
00:10:03,425 --> 00:10:06,225
and accept the applause and reward 

147
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,870
from all over the world together

148
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:11,321
 on behalf of Chinese manufacture

149
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,600
President Pan, don't worry

150
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,486
I will make 500 million in three months

151
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,975
Mom

152
00:10:27,675 --> 00:10:29,960
Later you and Yuwei eat first

153
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,360
I will wait for Liu Yang to come back

154
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:32,159
Ok

155
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,679
It's so hard for you during this time

156
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,000
I have the time now

157
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,120
I will pick up Yuwei for early education class

158
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:42,440
I'll go

159
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,080
I don't want to idle around anyway

160
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:57,519
Come

161
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,840
Yuwei

162
00:11:00,425 --> 00:11:02,600
I have told you, you need to eat by yourself

163
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:06,320
Come

164
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,679
Don't play with toys while eating

165
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,559
Play after lunch

166
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,879
Eat

167
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:20,440
Just let her play

168
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,320
Mom, it's a bad habit

169
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,559
She needs to get rid of it

170
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:28,000
Why are you crying?

171
00:11:28,775 --> 00:11:31,279
You love your daughter dearly, right?

172
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:33,798
You spoil and yell at her at the same time

173
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,120
Mom

174
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,080
I love her but I will not spoil her

175
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,519
She can't have this bad problem

176
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:40,879
This is true love

177
00:11:42,325 --> 00:11:45,559
My granddaughter is so angry

178
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:46,679
Go

179
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:49,960
What did you say?

180
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:51,720
You go

181
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,639
From whom do you learn this?

182
00:11:57,919 --> 00:11:58,559
Ok...

183
00:11:58,559 --> 00:11:59,320
Stop crying...

184
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,440
Ok, don't cry

185
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,440
Eat

186
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,360
You need to attend class later

187
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:03,919
Come

188
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,320
I let her drop out from the early education class

189
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:13,720
What?

190
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,559
I cancelled the early education class

191
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:22,440
How much money does Liu Yang make a month?

192
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:24,960
We can't waste money on this

193
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:27,679
It's not waste

194
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,759
It's waste

195
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:33,759
You tell me, you have no money and can't afford a second child

196
00:12:34,225 --> 00:12:36,320
Spend less money on Yuwei

197
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:37,559
Let alone second child

198
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:38,679
You will have the third kid

199
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:40,679
Mom, you...

200
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:48,360
Eat

201
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:50,799
Hello

202
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:51,600
Hello

203
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,080
Is it Liu Yuwei's parent?

204
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:54,679
Yes, I am

205
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:55,559
Who are you?

206
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,679
This is Little Talent Training Organization

207
00:12:57,799 --> 00:12:58,750
You made an appointment of left brain 

208
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,905
development training last week

209
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,000
But you didn't come

210
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,200
So do you need to make another appointment?

211
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,200
Sorry

212
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,559
I am busy now

213
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,639
Can I make an appointment for tomorrow?

214
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:13,639
Ok, no problem

215
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:16,120
Let's make it 19:00 tomorrow

216
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,200
Ok, thank you

217
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,475
Mom, you didn't take her to left brain training class, either

218
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:30,120
I didn't

219
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,000
Zhizhi

220
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,325
Don't blame me for being troublesome

221
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:40,440
Yuwei's food, clothes and nutrition

222
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,440
It costs so much money

223
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,600
Do you have any idea?

224
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,960
You let her attend all kinds of classes

225
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,600
She will make the family bankrupt

226
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,039
It's not spending money

227
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,679
It's investment

228
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:53,000
What?

229
00:13:53,275 --> 00:13:55,440
I think, you spend money for nothing

230
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,625
Mom, how can you say so in front of her?

231
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,320
What's wrong?

232
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:05,080
She doesn't understand

233
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:06,559
She is four years old

234
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:07,879
She understands

235
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:09,480
She doesn't understand

236
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,559
She is not so smart

237
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:11,960
Besides, am I wrong?

238
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,879
You spend the money for nothing

239
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,440
I don't like it

240
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:17,879
Mom

241
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:19,360
How can you say like this?

242
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,399
She is my daughter

243
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,080
Liu Yang's daughter

244
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:26,440
We make money for her

245
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,559
Stop it

246
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:31,360
Ask your own conscience

247
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,759
How much money do you make?

248
00:14:33,175 --> 00:14:35,919
My son Liu Yang supports this family

249
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,919
Yes, my husband makes the money

250
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,519
But I have the final say on how much money he spends

251
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,000
I'm his mom, he has to listen to me

252
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:45,519
Yeah

253
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,759
But he has to listen to me after he marries me

254
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,080
You don't understand anything

255
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,120
He still listens to you?

256
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,840
You messed up the family

257
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,320
I am so sick of it

258
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,480
All because Yuwei is a girl, right?

259
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:58,300
If I had a son, you wouldn't mind how much money I spend

260
00:14:58,639 --> 00:14:59,200
Correct

261
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,879
What times now?

262
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,679
Boys and girls

263
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,320
You are a woman, too

264
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,120
Why do you despise women so?

265
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,480
Don't talk about this

266
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:13,200
So noisy

267
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,279
Ridiculous

268
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,840
Stop eating

269
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:36,440
Mr. Liu

270
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,320
Bye

271
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:38,840
Mr. Liu, see you tomorrow

272
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,480
See you tomorrow

273
00:15:57,879 --> 00:15:58,559
Hello

274
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,879
Hello, Liu Yang

275
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,639
Can you come home early today?

276
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:04,360
What happened?

277
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,279
I can't get along with your mom

278
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,120
I just quarreled with her

279
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:12,559
Why?

280
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,120
You'll know when you come back

281
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,100
Yuwei doesn't listen to me now

282
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,320
She picks up the bad habits

283
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,679
Not a big deal

284
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,720
Not a big deal?

285
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,840
It's your daughter

286
00:16:29,075 --> 00:16:32,159
The bad habits die hard

287
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:35,475
You don't know what your mom said in front of Yuwei

288
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:38,800
In front of Yuwei, she said I wasted money on her

289
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,240
Ok, stop it

290
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,759
I will talk to my mom

291
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:45,559
Ok, come back early

292
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:46,559
Ok

293
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,880
Yang

294
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,519
Mom

295
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,160
Let me tell you

296
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,839
I didn't say anything

297
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,279
It's a fact that Yuwei spends much money

298
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:35,920
Right?

299
00:17:36,525 --> 00:17:39,640
I need to take care of your daughter and cook for you

300
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,680
I even do the laundry

301
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,680
I do so much work

302
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,480
Now she even nitpicks me 

303
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,960
Ridiculous

304
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,079
Ma, I need to work

305
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,599
Stop quarrelling, ok?

306
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:51,440
For me, ok?

307
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,880
Who quarrelled?

308
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:54,640
All because of your wife

309
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,880
Ok, it's enough

310
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:58,000
I'm busy now

311
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,640
Bye

312
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:31,240
Brother Yang

313
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,920
You still didn't go home?

314
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:35,640
I want to stay here a while

315
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,039
Brother Yang, look

316
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,240
What?

317
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:52,599
Where did you get this?

318
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,759
After I went home, I told my family I wanted to eat small potatoes

319
00:18:56,759 --> 00:18:57,920
My dad sent this to me

320
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,225
I haven't seen small potatoes for at least ten years

321
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,359
Brother Yang, take this back

322
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,839
Let your wife cook it for you

323
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:10,240
She?

324
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,599
She can't do it

325
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:15,559
We can't make it without firewood stove

326
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,799
I know a place, it has the stove

327
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,440
I will send you the address

328
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:20,480
Ok

329
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:08,839
Sister Yun

330
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,359
Can you take me to firewood stove tonight?

331
00:20:18,039 --> 00:20:19,000
Ok

332
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:31,880
Eat it yourself

333
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,599
Mom, time for dinner

334
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:48,240
Have a try

335
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,799
How's it? Brother Yang

336
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,319
Is this what you want?

337
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,759
Finally

338
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:17,799
You are back

339
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,119
A good news?

340
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:29,505
I am the sales director from now on

341
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,839
Great

342
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:33,400
Come, congratulations

343
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:34,799
Cheers

344
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,480
I booked a ticket and I will leave the day after tomorrow

345
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,759
I just got promoted

346
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,720
I am sorry that I can't go back with you

347
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,559
I can understand

348
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:04,400
But communication is so advanced

349
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,319
We can make video calls anytime, anywhere

350
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,440
Long distance relationship is not a big deal

351
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:12,425
And on the way to office, 

352
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:15,025
I will be stuck in traffic jam for one hour or two

353
00:23:15,025 --> 00:23:18,625
So it makes no difference between here and hometown

354
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,079
It's not far away from here

355
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:24,759
If I miss you, I will come here by train 

356
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,920
Then we will meet each other

357
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:16,160
Eat on time and take medicine on time

358
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,119
Don't stay up late

359
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,329
Drink less

360
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,039
Don't work overtime too often

361
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:25,279
We need to have video calls every day

362
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,000
Three times a day

363
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:29,160
No less than three minutes each time

364
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,775
Tell me if you are on a business trip

365
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,839
I will send you off the day after tomorrow

366
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,559
Next

367
00:26:57,559 --> 00:26:58,400
I want to talk about

368
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,000
Financialization of art investment

369
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:03,900
Financialization of art investment has six forms

370
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:10,021
Mortgage, pledge, loan and trust of artwork

371
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,519
Art Fund

372
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:12,480
Art stock

373
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,799
The last is the appreciation of art

374
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:17,920
But first

375
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,319
We have to clarify a concept

376
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:05,680
For appreciation of artwork

377
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,150
I hope all of you can trust your instincts

378
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,008
Get immersed

379
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:14,600
Then mobilize your experience and background to understand it

380
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,925
The term is created in the early twentieth century

381
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,925
It emphasizes artist's inner feelings

382
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:26,519
We can understand art better after we know technical terms

383
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,359
Why don't you go in?

384
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:31,000
His lectures are boring, don't you think so?

385
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:34,880
Liu's lectures are just like this

386
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:38,000
He is a boring buy

387
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:40,440
More than that, he is very forgetful

388
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,525
He reassigned two weeks ago's homework last week

389
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:45,319
More than that

390
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,279
I paid his money back last week

391
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:48,920
He asked me for money again yesterday

392
00:28:49,675 --> 00:28:51,505
As I know, he is very stingy

393
00:28:52,825 --> 00:28:56,440
As I know, when he was a junior

394
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,720
he invited his classmate to a Rougamo

395
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,880
Now he even asked him for money

396
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,759
Ridiculous

397
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:04,480
Eat one

398
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:05,880
Travel through time and space

399
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,279
Have a dialogue with the artist

400
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:09,319
Are you my classmate?

401
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,160
Why I didn't notice you before?

402
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:14,240
I don't come often

403
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:16,880
You often skip classes

404
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,400
This is his true intention of works

405
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:25,559
We should go in now

406
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,680
Go in now?

407
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:29,599
I have experience for this

408
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,960
We go in now

409
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,559
And then ask a question before the class is over

410
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:34,825
Then he won't know we skip the class

411
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:37,519
Brilliant

412
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:43,279
Keep up

413
00:29:59,925 --> 00:30:01,640
That's all for today

414
00:30:03,275 --> 00:30:05,920
You should read these books

415
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,799
Then you should write a review

416
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,359
Send it to my mailbox before next class

417
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,759
Do you understand?

418
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:16,160
Ok, dismiss

419
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:18,680
I will go to ask a question

420
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,480
Teacher Liu

421
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:31,200
What are the two important features of art financial investment?

422
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,240
I didn't catch it

423
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,680
Can you tell me now?

424
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:35,160
I said it just now

425
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,359
Look

426
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:39,475
The artwork has become an important object of

427
00:30:39,475 --> 00:30:41,240
financial institution asset management

428
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,675
Second, the artwork has become the object of 

429
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,760
credit rating and asset pricing for individuals and companies

430
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:46,920
So...

431
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,640
When are you here?

432
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,279
Just arrived

433
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,799
Is it over?

434
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:53,519
Let's go

435
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:54,079
Ok

436
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:54,920
Do you still have questions?

437
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,039
No

438
00:30:56,039 --> 00:30:57,575
Wait for me a while

439
00:30:58,359 --> 00:30:59,559
So how about today?

440
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:00,799
Go dutch?

441
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,400
If you want to go dutch

442
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,359
you need to pay the money

443
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,225
You didn't pay me the money of Rougamo yet

444
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,200
Stop talking nonsense

445
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,240
Brothers are waiting

446
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:11,920
Hurry

447
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,400
Not nonsense

448
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:14,559
You are a big boss

449
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,300
You should invite me to a meal

450
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,599
Gosh

451
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,279
Where will we go?

452
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:28,200
Today we will go dutch

453
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,160
I have said...

454
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,400
You...

455
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:34,839
Me?

456
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,759
I think she comes for me

457
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:37,400
You?

458
00:31:38,359 --> 00:31:39,200
Teacher Liu

459
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:54,960
You are his classmate?

460
00:31:56,325 --> 00:31:57,450
Why did not you tell me earlier?

461
00:31:58,775 --> 00:32:00,519
You fear I will tell him the truth?

462
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,799
No

463
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,079
If you add my WeChat

464
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,400
I won't betray you

465
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,079
All right

466
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,720
If you decline my invitation,

467
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:32,039
I will still tell him

468
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:33,200
It's blackmail

469
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:34,720
Goodbye

470
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,079
Hello, I'm from Lubao Group

471
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:02,119
Sales Director

472
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:03,160
Li Siyu

473
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:07,559
Lubao Group's paper for the tender

474
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:09,680
Ok, I will register it

475
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,400
Thank you

476
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,599
Brother Yang

477
00:33:12,925 --> 00:33:16,119
I have submitted the paper for tender on behalf of Lubao

478
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,440
Wu accepted it

479
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,559
Ok

480
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,160
Much appreciated

481
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:32,680
Siyu

482
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:34,880
I want to invite you a drink tonight, I wonder if you have the time

483
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:41,039
Ok

484
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:24,675
Xiawei, go ask Wu if he has collected all the bidders' papers

485
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:25,920
Ok

486
00:34:31,074 --> 00:34:33,118
You eat little in the cafeteria

487
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,280
Your stomachache comes again?

488
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:36,039
Yes

489
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:41,475
You are an adult, but don't know how to take care of yourself

490
00:35:04,225 --> 00:35:05,266
You keep these boxes for me

491
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:08,960
Come

492
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,199
Only these?

493
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,639
Yeah, that's all

494
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,119
What else?

495
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,400
No

496
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:24,825
So what about you and Li Siyu?

497
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:31,960
Leave it be for the time being

498
00:35:33,719 --> 00:35:34,480
Bro

499
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,350
It's unlikely that long-distance relationship has a happy ending

500
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:42,075
But I think you two are different

501
00:35:44,875 --> 00:35:48,159
Why are you so confident in us?

502
00:35:49,425 --> 00:35:51,199
Why you don't think so?

503
00:35:58,025 --> 00:36:02,950
I often feel I can't control her even if she is by my side

504
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,575
Not to mention now we are hundreds of kilometers away

505
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:10,679
Li Siyu can fly?

506
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:12,679
She can't fly

507
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:18,000
But I might let her down

508
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:19,639
Impossible

509
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:26,519
When I think I can't send her an umbrella when it rains

510
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:29,519
I can't give her medicine when she is sick

511
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:33,280
When she needs comfort

512
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,679
I can only call her

513
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:37,440
I am not optimistic about our future

514
00:36:41,025 --> 00:36:42,585
Don't go

515
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,275
If I don't go, she will be more disappointed

516
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:59,250
You and Siyu won't break up, right?

517
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,320
Not for now

518
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:08,550
But who knows one year later...

519
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:10,559
Two years later...

520
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:14,599
No one knows for sure

521
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,760
That's all

522
00:37:21,475 --> 00:37:23,000
I didn't finish packing

523
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:23,719
Bye

524
00:37:26,039 --> 00:37:27,280
What time tomorrow?  I will see you off

525
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,950
No need, I'll go by myself

526
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:21,239
Siyu

527
00:38:22,039 --> 00:38:22,679
Sister Ziru

528
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:23,480
Kept you waiting

529
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:24,559
No, I just arrived

530
00:38:24,679 --> 00:38:25,599
Why don't you go in?

531
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:26,360
It's ok

532
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,000
Go

533
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:36,400
Yesterday, I met president Pan

534
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:40,975
He told me you are sales director now

535
00:38:43,475 --> 00:38:47,039
So I want to celebrate it for you

536
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:48,599
Thank you, sister Ziru

537
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:54,599
Without your support and encouragement

538
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,000
I might have given up long ago

539
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,679
You won't

540
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:02,950
You won't give up so easily

541
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:06,537
I just let you recognize yourself

542
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,480
Sit, Siyu

543
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:15,800
Feel at ease

544
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:21,159
Sister Ziru

545
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,440
How's your talk with president Pan?

546
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,320
Pretty good

547
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:26,960
The whole negotiation is smooth

548
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:30,650
President Pan has gumption and broad mind

549
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:32,719
It's right that you cooperate with him

550
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,199
I know this

551
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,519
Our team is very good, too

552
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:39,775
Actually after you are sales director,

553
00:39:39,775 --> 00:39:42,800
I am more confident in Lubao's management

554
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:44,280
Well

555
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:48,675
Have you seen the representatives of those two companies?

556
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,440
You mean Huaan and Shanghai Bank?

557
00:39:51,159 --> 00:39:51,840
Correct

558
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,679
Not yet

559
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,719
Maybe it's not the time

560
00:39:57,079 --> 00:39:57,719
Eat

561
00:39:57,950 --> 00:40:00,159
This is the new dish

562
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:00,760
Have a try

563
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:01,760
Ok

564
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,159
Thank you

565
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:07,639
Sister Ziru, you should eat

566
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,559
How is Yiming?

567
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,639
Pretty good

568
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,599
What happened?

569
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:36,567
We may break up

570
00:40:39,159 --> 00:40:40,039
Why?

571
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:45,199
He resigned

572
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:48,800
And he didn't find a suitable job

573
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,800
He finds a chance in his hometown

574
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:54,280
So he wants to go back and try

575
00:40:57,159 --> 00:40:58,960
You have talked about breaking up?

576
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:02,679
Not yet

577
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:09,100
But I have a bad hunch

578
00:41:09,725 --> 00:41:13,559
I think we will break up sooner or later

579
00:41:18,575 --> 00:41:21,000
Your love won't be so fragile

580
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:29,886
Long-distance relationship's breakup rate is over 90%

581
00:41:31,775 --> 00:41:34,440
Now Lubao is facing the most critical stage

582
00:41:36,039 --> 00:41:37,519
I am the sales director

583
00:41:38,625 --> 00:41:41,960
I need to work whole-heartedly

584
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:48,325
I have no time or energy for a long distance relationship

585
00:42:04,199 --> 00:42:05,719
It's simple

586
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:09,000
Simple?

587
00:42:10,875 --> 00:42:12,800
As I know, Yiming does the planning, right?

588
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,559
Yes

589
00:42:16,025 --> 00:42:19,119
My company has a vacancy of planning director

590
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:23,450
I don't know if Yiming has any interest

591
00:42:24,725 --> 00:42:27,039
We will offer a higher salary

592
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,480
But it's a new department

593
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:30,599
The scale is relatively small

594
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,360
Sister Ziru

595
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,480
You are saving my love

596
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:01,559
Yiming

597
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:11,639
Why?

598
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,400
Yiming, we won't be separated
