[Episode 31]

4
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:41,330
- Please wait a moment. President He will be here shortly. 
 - Thank you.

5
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,380
Ms. Gu.

6
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,080
Mr. He, hello.

7
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,470
Hello.

8
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,140
Please sit.

9
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,380
Here is your coffee.

10
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,340
Thank you.

11
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:48,240
President He, I will leave now.

12
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,360
Mr. He, we meet again.

13
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,260
Indeed.

14
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:02,710
I only have 15 minutes.

15
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:08,900
This is our art museum's member's manual.

16
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,970
Ms. Gu, you could have shipped the member's manual to me,

17
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:23,710
or you could have sent an electronic copy.

18
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:26,440
You could even have given it to me the next time I visit the art museum.

19
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:30,270
Why did you come here personally?

20
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,990
Because you are our most important member.

21
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:40,790
I speculate you came all this way for me, right?

22
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:46,820
In order to make it so you didn't come here for nothing,

23
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:50,390
as well as to save time and increase efficiency,

24
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:52,740
I will get straight to the point.

25
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:56,000
My name is He Mu. I'm a male, 35 years old.

26
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,050
I graduated from Stanford as a computer science major.

27
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:01,550
I came back to the country two years ago and created this company.

28
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:04,130
Currently, the annual profit is around ¥50,000,000.

29
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:08,810
This is my diploma and this is my business license.

30
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:12,550
My body is very healthy. I am passionate about fitness, do not smoke, and drink occasionally.

31
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,530
I don't have any hereditary diseases.

32
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:18,430
This is my genetics report, and this contains my physical examinations from the past two years.

33
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:21,620
I have never gotten married but have had three relationships before.

34
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:26,910
I broke up peacefully with each woman. After the breakups, I have no more business or relationship connections to them.

35
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:30,530
I do not have any siblings and my parents were in the education industry.

36
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:33,310
They have both since retired and are living the rest of their days in our hometown.

37
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:36,060
They are both in good health. This is my household registration.

38
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,500
These are my honorary credentials.

39
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,030
It's your turn.

40
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:45,100
W-What?

41
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,600
I still have eight minutes.

42
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:55,340
I... don't really understand.

43
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:59,470
You can start by explaining your living habits.

44
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:02,760
My living habits are really good, I'm very healthy.

45
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,160
I also like to exercise,

46
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:09,040
and my parents are both in our hometown.

47
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,970
I...

48
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:15,440
Ms. Gu, your thought process is a little messy.

49
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,520
- How about this? I ask questions. You answer them. 
 - Sure.

50
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,380
- Do you smoke? 
 - I do not.

51
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:24,050
- Do you drink? 
 - A little bit.

52
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:27,350
Are you willing to raise two or more children?

53
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:30,970
Y-Yes.

54
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,100
Can you briefly introduce your family dynamic?

55
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:43,860
When I was eight years old, my father died,

56
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:48,290
so then my s- my mother married my stepfather and took me along.

57
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:51,400
My stepfather is a great person. He's an engineer.

58
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,370
My mom is a normal office worker.

59
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:56,290
Also, I have an older sister who has different biological parents,

60
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,570
and she's starting her own business right now.

61
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:02,350
- Your father died due to...? 
 - A car accident.

62
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:04,630
You don't have any hereditary diseases?

63
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,760
Definitely not.

64
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:11,030
- Height? 
 - 170 cm.

65
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:13,520
- Plastic surgery? 
 - Yes.

66
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,940
- Weight? 
 - 48 kilos.

67
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,600
Is that net weight?

68
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,250
That is for when I only have undergarments on.

69
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:28,860
Ms. Gu, you completely meet all the criteria I have for my future wife.

70
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,500
I have to go to a meeting very soon.

71
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,230
Next Thursday, from 4:44 p.m. to 6:21 p.m., I have time.

72
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,490
I hope that we can go out on a date.

73
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:43,460
- Isn't this... 
 - Ms. Gu.

74
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:46,780
My secretary, Ms. Chang, will give you my contact information.

75
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,690
See you next week.

76
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:22,030
Yuwei's mom, how about you take Yuwei to the hospital for an examination?

77
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:27,410
Teacher, this kind of thing has never happened with Yuwei before.

78
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:30,900
Perhaps it was not triggered in the past, so it didn't happen then.

79
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,370
Yuwei doesn't have any problems.

80
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:37,030
She has already peed her pants three times this week.

81
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:39,220
This is not normal.

82
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:43,370
It might be because she just got put in a new environment and isn't used to it.

83
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:46,860
She's already been in this kindergarten for half a month, how could she still not have adjusted?

84
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,350
This daughter of yours is too much of a princess.

85
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:55,180
Teacher, could it be because she ate something she shouldn't have?

86
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,860
How is this possible? All of the children eat the same thing.

87
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:01,100
If there was a problem with the food or drinks, then all of the other children would also experience the same thing.

88
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,770
How come it only happened to your Liu Yuwei?

89
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:09,870
Mommy,

90
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:12,550
I want to go home.

91
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:16,550
Fine. It's almost time to go anyways.

92
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:19,700
Today, you can go home early with your mom.

93
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:22,930
Thank you, Teacher. We've troubled you.

94
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,920
Yuwei, you never peed your pants in the past.

95
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,970
What has been going on recently?

96
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:41,050
Did you do it on purpose?

97
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:44,730
- No. 
 - Then why?

98
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:51,500
Mommy, I want to go back to my old kindergarten.

99
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,230
Is this kindergarten not good?

100
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:57,320
This kindergarten is bad.

101
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,460
Why?

102
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:11,820
Yuwei, don't be afraid. Tell me. I will protect you.

103
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:16,020
The teacher scolds me and is mean to me. I'm scared.

104
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:21,260
I don't know what happened, my pee came out.

105
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,870
Why did she scold you?

106
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:26,720
She said that I eat too slow

107
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,290
and my actions are slow,

108
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:30,890
and she wouldn't let me eat. She made me stand in a corner as punishment.

109
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:32,760
What?

110
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,680
Let's go.

111
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,540
Liu Yuwei's mom, do you have some kind of misunderstanding about me?

112
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:48,430
Liu Yuwei already told me everything. There are no misunderstandings.

113
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:51,260
Can you really trust everything that comes out of a child's mouth? They exaggerate.

114
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:54,070
- So you didn't scold her? 
 - Why would I scold her?

115
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:56,570
She created trouble and as a teacher, I just said a few words, is that not all right?

116
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:58,340
What about when you punished her by not letting her eat and forcing her to stand in a corner?

117
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:01,060
That's because your Liu Yuwei wet her pants and it smelled.

118
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:05,060
The other children were still eating, so I made her stand in the corner. Is that wrong?

119
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,990
What kind of teacher are you?

120
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:10,390
Principal, please say something.

121
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:13,300
I pretty much understand the situation now.

122
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:17,100
How about this? Teacher Fang, leave us for now.

123
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,790
Let me talk to Liu Yuwei's mother. Go ahead.

124
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:31,650
Principal, I demand that you assign a new teacher for Yuwei.

125
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,350
That's impossible.

126
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:37,180
- Why? 
 - The truth is that Teacher Fang

127
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:40,330
is just a little bit impatient. She's pretty good in every other way.

128
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:43,090
She doesn't have a kind heart!

129
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:46,520
We have criteria here to fulfill in order for someone to be a teacher.

130
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:50,210
Principal, this is my daughter, my entire family's baby.

131
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:54,050
I paid money for her to come here so that she can have the best care,

132
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:57,060
not to have her teacher look down on her!

133
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:05,670
Liu Yuwei's mom, how much money did you spend? You want the best care?

134
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,680
Still, the teacher shouldn't scare her to the point where she wets her pants!

135
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,530
The teacher just spoke a little too loudly.

136
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:17,120
Your baby has not developed fully in that area.

137
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,160
She's already four or five years old and still wets her pants. Whose fault is that?

138
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,280
What kind of attitude is this, Principal?

139
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,150
I think that as a parent,

140
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:29,600
the first thing is that you should not be so sensitive.

141
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,920
Every child here is just from an ordinary family.

142
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,370
Getting some set-back education is a good thing.

143
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:38,200
The second thing is don't try to get more than what you paid for.

144
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,130
Everyone should know the principle of "you get what you paid for."

145
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:49,280
I'm going to report this to higher authorities! I'm going to expose you guys!

146
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,920
Do as you wish.

147
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,390
It would be good to let people know about our kindergarten

148
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:57,050
only costs a little over ¥1,000 per month

149
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:01,650
and the children get food, drinks, and to play unharmed.

150
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:05,390
There are also teacher-led activities to help them learn characters and numbers.

151
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:09,070
Where could you possibly find a kindergarten like this?

152
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:30,090
Mommy, do I have to come to this kindergarten tomorrow?

153
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:33,260
Mommy, can I not come?

154
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,910
I'll stay at home with Daddy.

155
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:38,840
I promise that I won't eat junk,

156
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:42,450
won't make a fuss, and won't pee my pants.

157
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:04,010
Mommy, why are you crying?

158
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,560
I promise you

159
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,780
that in the future, I will never let you be bullied again. Okay?

160
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:33,760
According to President Li's proposal to reach 500 cities by the end of next years

161
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,630
and the goal of 8,000 service areas,

162
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:42,830
I estimate that our marketing cost each month

163
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:45,650
will be at least

164
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:51,110
¥1,580,000.

165
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,890
I can give you at most this number. 
 [158]

166
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,140
Then there is no way I can do it.

167
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:08,260
Is it possible to exchange resources with other websites?

168
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:11,000
Then we must have at least one million or more users.

169
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,570
before others will talk about exchanging resources with us.

170
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:16,600
- When can we reach one million? 
 - I can do it as long as the marketing is in place.

171
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,800
As long as there is money, I also have no problem accomplishing things.

172
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,030
As long as you can earn the money back, I also have no problems.

173
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:23,910
I will kick whoever kicks the ball again!
   (T/N: kicking/passing the ball/problem to each other)

174
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,260
If we don't consider marketing,

175
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:34,190
before the end of this year, can you get one million users?

176
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:36,440
If we don't consider marketing then we must consider services.

177
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:40,040
Right now, our franchisee of service areas hasn't reached a certain number. Even if they reach that number,

178
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,190
we could still lose them.

179
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:46,550
Within two months, get another two hundred franchisees.

180
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:49,000
President Li, just kill me.

181
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,880
Even if I get one a day, in two months, I can only get sixty more.

182
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,360
- I— 
 - All right. I will handle the one hundred and forty left.

183
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,220
- President Li— 
 - Sister Tian, help me book the earliest train ticket to Hefei today.

184
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,680
- Okay. 
 - Xiao Lu.

185
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:04,700
You told me last time that there was someone who wanted to be a regional agent in Hefei. Give me the material about them.

186
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,020
That's all for today. Meeting is over.

187
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:13,130
My goodness. President Li wants to risk her life.

188
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:16,650
- Sister Fan, can't you just give some more money? 
 - Where do I get the money?

189
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:20,270
Doesn't our company still have money?

190
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:22,540
Have you thought about it clearly?

191
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,420
Yes, I have.

192
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,400
I'm a great person in a lot of ways,

193
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,790
but I'm petty and love to hold grudges.

194
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,060
Director Yuan,

195
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,860
I'm sorry.

196
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,970
In the past, there are things that I didn't do well.

197
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:46,710
I apologize to you for it.

198
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:49,850
You're pretty good with words, pretty smart.

199
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:53,600
I'm not smart, but I will not be lazy.

200
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:58,340
Fine. I accept.

201
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:01,560
However, as my subordinate, your pressure will be immense.

202
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,990
I will also be able to learn a lot.

203
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:09,370
I still don't understand. Didn't Li Siyu just start a new company?

204
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:12,770
If you want to make money, why not reach out to her?

205
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,050
She just started the business,

206
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:18,110
so it is quite a difficult time for her.

207
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:33,020
- Older Sister. 
 - How come you're here?

208
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:36,230
Look. A-Accompanying you on your business trip.

209
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,150
Who asked you to accompany me on this business trip?

210
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:43,310
You put so much work aside just to come here, are you out of your mind?

211
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:48,230
No, Sister. Don't be so irritable.

212
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:51,590
Sorry, please excuse me. Sorry.

213
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:57,260
I-I'll help you.

214
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:02,880
Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.

215
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:11,350
Sister, first, I did all of the work you assigned me.

216
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:15,880
Second, I made this webpage for Hefei that you can directly click into.

217
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,940
If you take this to the discussion, I'm sure it will be successful.

218
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:26,060
- When did you make this? 
 - Just now.

219
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:30,490
If they have any uncertainties about my design skills, I can clear it up right there and then.

220
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:34,270
If there are any problems, I can also fix it right there.

221
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,650
After I finish working in Hefei, I will go to Nantong.

222
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:41,810
Ask Xiao Lu for the materials.

223
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:45,930
Before the train arrives in Hefei, I want a webpage for Nantong as well.

224
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:48,280
Got it.

225
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,880
- Hello, how many people? 
 - I have a reservation.

226
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:07,190
Hello.

227
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:13,170
You are late by 5 minutes and 32 seconds.

228
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,270
I'm sorry, there was traffic.

229
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:18,430
At this time, there is definitely traffic downtown,

230
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:23,390
so you should have left at least 15 minutes earlier.

231
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:29,010
- I know now. 
 - Waitress.

232
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:33,150
Are the two of you ready to order?

233
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:34,880
I would like a steak set meal and a soda water.

234
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,710
Thank you.

235
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,740
Same, thank you.

236
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:42,080
What kind of drink do you want, Miss?

237
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,180
Iced latte. No sugar. Skimmed milk.

238
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,380
You're drinking it iced?

239
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,600
What's wrong?

240
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,250
If a woman tends to have cold drinks, it will cause the uterus to get cold and make it difficult to make children, 
 (T/N: very common belief in China)

241
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,950
so I hope that in the future, you will not have any iced drinks.

242
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:57,920
This is in consideration of your well-being.

243
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:01,460
Please change the drink to a hot lemon tea, thank you.

244
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,710
Okay.

245
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:17,120
This time period you picked is quite interesting.

246
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:22,170
4:44 to 6:21.

247
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:24,690
Is there any specific meaning to it?

248
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:28,280
My meeting ended at 4:30. It takes me three minutes to go down to the parking garage to get the car.

249
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:32,310
It takes nine minutes to get from the company to here and two minutes to park,

250
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:34,930
so I made plans with you to meet at 4:44.

251
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:38,200
At 6:45, I have an online meeting.

252
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,050
Even though it's the evening rush hour, there won't be a standstill.

253
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:43,390
It will only take three traffic lights' time.

254
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:46,120
From here to get back to the company, I need twenty minutes.

255
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,940
It takes three minutes to park and go upstairs,

256
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,310
so at 6:21,

257
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:52,630
our date will end.

258
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:56,430
- What are you doing? 
 - Weighing it.

259
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:59,990
My personal trainer gave me a diet plan.

260
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:03,850
I have a strict limit on my calorie intake.

261
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,700
Look at them.

262
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:22,190
Don't mind the stares of others.

263
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:27,260
I don't really mind,

264
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:31,210
but I never would have thought that you would be so strict with yourself.

265
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:37,260
One's degree of self-management is an important standard use to distinguishing the elite from the grass-root class.

266
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,550
This kind of management is not only for work.

267
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:42,310
It also includes one's body and mannerism

268
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:45,860
as well as how the family operates and children's education.

269
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,040
That makes sense.

270
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,480
Later, I'll create one for you as well.

271
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:58,240
- Create what? 
 - A self-management plan.

272
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:22,520
Next Thursday, from 12:14 to 3:44,

273
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:25,920
we can have lunch together and then watch a movie.

274
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,080
We're meeting next week, too?

275
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,760
We must have at least one date per week.

276
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,250
That will allow us to get to know each other better and develop our relationship.

277
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,770
Next week...

278
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:39,080
Next week, I am n-not sure whether or not I'll be free.

279
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,460
If you don't have time, you can contact Ms. Chang.

280
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:44,570
She will help you set up our next date.

281
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:47,430
- Okay then. 
 - See you next week.

282
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:50,050
N-Next week...

283
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:53,330
let's meet?

284
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,520
- She's asleep? 
 - Yes.

285
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:21,710
Right now, I'm asking my college seniors to help me find a job.

286
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,670
Didn't the doctors tell you to rest?

287
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:27,190
Why are you being so impatient?

288
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:30,730
Just stay here and take care of Yuwei.

289
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:33,750
I want to quickly find a job

290
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:36,230
to lessen the stress you're under.

291
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:38,960
I can deal with my own stress.

292
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:11,220
Xiaoling?

293
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:14,020
Wait, wait, wait!

294
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:17,870
Lei Haowen, open the door! Nobody will look at you!

295
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:26,480
- Quick! 
 - Coming, coming!

296
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,420
Why aren't you wearing shoes?

297
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,620
Come put on the slippers.

298
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:38,800
- Do you have band-aids? I cut my feet. 
 - Yes!

299
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:50,860
Where is the cut?

300
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:56,020
Let me see.

301
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:59,920
Your foot just healed. Why did you wear heels?

302
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,180
The heels are so tall, too.

303
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:08,880
It isn't easy for me to date, you know?

304
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:11,430
Who were you on a date with?

305
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,580
I went on a date with a nerd.

306
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,550
After that?

307
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:22,620
I don't know if I should have an "afterwards" with him.

308
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,510
It's done.

309
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:27,440
Do you have any food here?

310
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,510
In the kitchen. Help yourself.

311
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:33,670
I'm too lazy to move. Just pity me and go to help me get it. Go.

312
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,700
Fine.

313
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:46,160
Why don't you tell me in advance every time you come?

314
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,410
What if I'm keeping a lover here?

315
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:52,150
- If you bump into each other, how embarrassing would that be? 
 - You?

316
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:54,520
Impossible!

317
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:59,390
Don't look down on me.

318
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,700
If I really have someone one day,

319
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,130
it will be too late for you to cry.

320
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:11,080
- Who? 
 - My girlfriend.

321
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,600
What are you going to do?

322
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,600
I'm going to let your girlfriend in.

323
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:20,530
Are you stupid? I'm a lonely man, you are a lonely woman, and you are so hot,

324
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:22,380
when she sees this, won't she be angry at me?

325
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,900
What should I do in your opinion?

326
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,540
Go hide in the room for now.

327
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:32,140
- No, I-I should— 
 - Go hide in the room first. I will get her to leave in a bit.

328
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:34,650
Come out after she leaves. Remember, don't come out.

329
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:38,340
- I should— 
 - Don't come out! Listen.

330
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:41,360
Come out only when I say to.

331
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:55,070
Hello, Sir, your—

332
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,980
takeout.

333
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:06,180
How many times have I told you already? I don't eat dinner!

334
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:08,540
I'm trying to lose weight, don't you know?

335
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,860
Don't you know?

336
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:14,610
Don't cry. What is there to cry about?

337
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:17,440
Don't contact me anymore. Call me if you need me.

338
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,930
Leave, leave, leave!

339
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:30,060
Xiaoling!

340
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:33,030
Come on out!

341
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:39,970
Your girlfriend left so quickly?

342
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:42,020
She brought me some delicious food but I said I won't eat it.

343
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:44,130
Then I asked her to leave.

344
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:57,160
Is your girlfriend's surname "Mei Tuan"? 
 (T/N: Mei Tuan is a Chinese food delivery App)?

345
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:01,670
Yes. I have another girlfriend.

346
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:03,780
Her surname is "e."

347
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,750
Her name is “leme." 
 (T/N:Eleme is another Chinese food delivery App)

348
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:08,780
Those two get into jealous fights over me.

349
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:11,180
They have some fierce fights.

350
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:16,180
You need to treat both of them well then.

351
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:21,700
That is mine.

352
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,330
I'm just taking a few bites, what's the big deal?

353
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:26,070
You just went on a date!

354
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:30,010
How could you steal food from someone who hasn't eaten?

355
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:31,560
I—

356
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:38,710
Let me tell you. My saliva is on that.

357
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:43,420
So what?

358
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:45,360
Aren't you afraid that I have some kind of disease?

359
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,100
What disease could you possibly have?

360
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:54,780
You will die if it gets serious.

361
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:58,620
Then I will die for your saliva. It will be a worthy death.

362
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:02,370
Then my deep affection for you won't be wasted.

363
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:12,870
When people talk to me about meaningful things,

364
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:14,810
I feel bored.

365
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:18,930
Yet when you say nonsense to me, I feel happy.

366
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:22,430
What kind of person am I?

367
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:24,830
It's because you are the same kind of person as me.

368
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:29,380
We two are both Chinese counterfeit goods!

369
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:32,540
I'm going to beat you up!

370
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:34,360
Hit me. Come hit me.

371
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,910
Come down from there.

372
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:38,170
Come, come hit me in the bedroom.

373
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:41,640
Come out here!

374
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,350
Lei Haowen, open the door!

375
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:46,960
Give the shoe back to me!

376
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,980
Didn't Qijue Group sign a contract with us for an order? How come we lost the order?

377
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:53,780
Director Yuan, it was really not my fault.

378
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:56,120
- Who is to blame then? 
 - You don't know

379
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:59,100
just how weird the manager who was in charge of this project was.

380
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,070
Every time I go to see him,

381
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:04,840
- I will shiver. 
 - I'm asking you about the contract!

382
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:09,010
That Manager Su is asking for a lot so I don't dare to comply with his demands.

383
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:12,160
- Thus, he backed out of it. 
 - How much is he asking for?

384
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,830
It's definitely beyond our limit!

385
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:21,670
Then how will we calculate your sales performance for this month?

386
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:23,550
I...

387
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:26,460
I will accept any punishment.

388
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:34,570
- Also, Zhang Zhizhi is joining our department. 
 - What?

389
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:37,180
- What would she do here? 
 - Sales.

390
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:40,920
- Can she do it? 
 - Is it possible that she has ulterior motives?

391
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:45,430
I asked HR, and they said that her family is struggling so she wants to earn some money here.

392
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:48,320
- That's quite naive of her. 
 - Karma.

393
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,860
Back then, when she scolded Director Yuan, she was so arrogant.

394
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:54,410
Director Yuan, use this opportunity to teach her a proper lesson.

395
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:57,340
Let her understand what it means to regret.

396
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:02,060
I have an idea.

397
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:06,400
Hey, let's rearrange this place so that it's cozier. This way, the clients will be happy when they see it.

398
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,820
Kuai Zi, put this green plant

399
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:12,380
over there on the side.

400
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:14,500
Put it inside.

401
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,360
Director Yuan, I'm here for work.

402
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:20,260
Director Yuan, where do I put these files and chairs?

403
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:22,430
Well...

404
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:27,460
- Empty out that room and use it as a storage place for all of these things. 
 - Okay.

405
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:30,920
Quickly, move, move, move. Xiao Wu. Bibo.

406
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,730
Director Yuan, I'm checking in.

407
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:37,400
Xiao Liu, push this shelf back.

408
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,920
Yes, here.

409
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,750
Put it against the window.

410
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:44,760
Here, put some more. Put some plants here

411
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,670
Yes, put them here, here.

412
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,490
Let me see. Put that here. Here.

413
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:52,320
Yes, yes, yes.

414
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,060
-  Yes, put them right here. 
 - Zhang Zhizhi.

415
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:56,380
Why are you standing like an idiot? Find a place to sit.

416
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:58,740
Are you waiting for others to take care of you?

417
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:18,560
- This seat is not occupied. Sit here. 
- Thank you.

418
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,630
Why did you pick this department? Aren't you asking for hardships? 
 (Literal translation: Aren't you looking to eat bitterness?)

419
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:29,770
As long as there's something to eat, who cares if it's bitter or sweet?

420
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:32,430
Director Yuan is definitely not going to let you have it easy.

421
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:36,520
Without her, my life won't be easy either.

422
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,540
Zhang Zhizhi!

423
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,440
Come here for a moment.

424
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:49,100
- Go visit this client? 
 - By myself?

425
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:53,260
What? Do you want me to hire you a secretary, a chauffeur, a nanny, and a hairstylist?

426
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:56,860
That's not what I meant. I'm just afraid that I'll mess up.

427
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:59,230
Since it's my first day in sales.

428
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:00,980
It's because it's your first day,

429
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,960
that's why I assigned you a top-tier client.

430
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,700
As long as he signs for the order,

431
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:09,030
your assignment for this month is done.

432
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:12,030
- Go on. 
 - Thanks, Director Yuan.

433
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:15,840
Lin Ling, put this in that room. Hurry, go.

434
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,670
Kuai Zi, come here and help me carry it.

435
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:18,960
Take it away. Take it away.

436
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,910
[Su Lixing]

437
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:30,550
Come in.

438
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,760
Are you Director Mei?

439
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:41,090
- Yes. 
 - Hello, Director Mei.

440
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:45,000
I am Li Siyu from Laidianle. This is Guan Xiaotang.

441
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,400
Why are you here looking for me?

442
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:50,530
We are here to talk about being a regional agent.

443
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:54,190
Collaborations, right?

444
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,370
Who is it?

445
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,680
Take a seat first. Don't just stand there.

446
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:08,540
You guys are from Laidianle?

447
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:10,130
Yes.

448
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,320
Do you know how to play this?

449
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,260
I've played it before.

450
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:25,220
Let's play a game.

451
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:27,160
Sure.

452
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:39,120
I rarely meet girls who knows how to play King of Fighters nowadays.

453
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,260
Do you play anything else normally?

454
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:44,760
- Just this. This is good. 
 - Just this?

455
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,600
Then you must be quite great at it.

456
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,300
Round One

457
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:52,380
Ready, go!

458
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,680
Hit! Hit!

459
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:03,980
[2 Hits]

460
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:07,140
Legs. Legs. Use your legs.

461
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:09,060
Leg!

462
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:13,650
You seem out of practice.

463
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:15,850
I haven't played in a long time.

464
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:20,670
Round Two. Ready, Go!

465
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,540
Director Mei,

466
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:29,060
if you can guarantee that you can get 200 points,

467
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,660
I can give the Hefei region agency to you.

468
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:36,390
I heard that some of your franchise businesses

469
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:39,410
are not as great as what you promoted.

470
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,650
That is because our customers

471
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:45,520
numbers haven't increased yet.

472
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,880
But our trend is quite good.

473
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,730
Trend?

474
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,490
I don't think your trend looks optimistic.

475
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:54,320
Hit him! Beat him up!

476
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,230
You're too strong!

477
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:02,930
- Player one wins! 
 - That was boring.

478
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:05,550
I'm not playing anymore.

479
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:08,690
 All right, today we have... 

480
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:12,220
In front of a pro like you, Director Mei,

481
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:14,620
I truly lost with admiration to you.

482
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:17,420
With your skill, do you really lose with admiration?

483
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:24,140
Director Mei, this is our newest statistical data.

484
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:28,340
You will know after you have a look. We are very promising.

485
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:33,900
I am the type of person who distrusts statistical data most.

486
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:41,860
How about you play instead?

487
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,800
Come on then.

488
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:57,050
In this game, I have never lost.

489
00:36:58,610 --> 00:37:00,370
In the pugilistic society, they called me

490
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:03,470
the "young and attractive little password."

491
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:07,390
"Young and attractive"? All right.

492
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:10,700
All right let me see what you, Little Thanos, got.

493
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:26,460
Come in.

494
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:33,930
Hello, Director Su.

495
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:38,070
You are...?

496
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:41,440
I'm Zhang Zhizhi, a salesperson from Lubao. Can I bother you for 15 minutes?

497
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,190
No.

498
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:48,250
I want to introduce our latest product to you.

499
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:50,180
I don't want to hear it.

500
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:54,290
- But— 
 - Where is the previous salesperson?

501
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:01,250
My colleague was occupied with other work today so—

502
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:06,440
- so my boss sent me today— 
 -So they sent a you, who can't even speak clearly. Right?

503
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,960
Your Lubao Group is really

504
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,140
becoming more and more rude.

505
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:14,490
- Today, I-I'm— 
 - What?

506
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:18,880
Please tell your boss that Qijue Science and Technology won't use any of Lubao's products!

507
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,380
From now on, you and your colleagues, have some  self-respect

508
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:24,800
and don't come back to harass me again. Don't.

509
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:50,230
Director Su, this is the introduction of our latest product.

510
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:53,180
If you have time, please have a look.

511
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:56,390
If you need to, please call me.

512
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:16,100
I've only used 10% of my skills.

513
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:18,440
I can't believe you sneak attacked me.

514
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:21,180
Don't be too happy. Again.

515
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:39,690
Who are you looking for?

516
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:41,860
How did you get in here?

517
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,560
That was intense!

518
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:22,140
Player Two wins!

519
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:27,550
You just had good luck.

520
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:33,540
Let's switch to another game. I don't believe it.

521
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:36,800
Pick whatever you like.

522
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:43,420
- Do you know League of Legend? 
 - Yup.

523
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:47,270
Come on. Let's play a solo round.

524
00:42:52,390 --> 00:42:54,370
Don't stop me.

525
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:02,490
- Do you have an account in Dianyi? 
 - You're also in Dianyi?

526
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:05,510
Not high-ranked, just level 5 diamond.

527
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:10,620
Send me your ID! I'll add you.

528
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:12,320
This one.

529
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,750
You are "Great God of Love"?

530
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,660
That is me.

531
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:32,140
No way!

532
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:35,240
- I'm your diehard fan! 
 - Really?

533
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:38,230
I've watched all of your competition videos!

534
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:44,420
I hope that we will have a pleasant collaboration.

535
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:48,280
Pleasant! It will definitely be pleasant. Pleasant, pleasant!

536
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:50,940
I met the real Great God of Love.

537
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:53,000
Continue working hard, okay?

538
00:43:53,830 --> 00:43:56,940
- How about I add you as a friend? 
 - Okay, okay! Okay!

539
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:02,260
Look!

540
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:08,400
Guan Xiaotang. I love you.

541
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:12,070
Guan Xiaotang. I love you.

542
00:44:12,070 --> 00:44:16,120
Guan Xiaotang! I love you!

543
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:19,420
You don't regret bringing me along this time, right?

544
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:24,240
Let me ask you. I told you to let Director Mei win. Why didn't you listen?

545
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:27,600
- Why should I let him win? 
- You want to do business with him.

546
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:30,060
You have to make him happy.

547
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:32,470
However, when I do things,

548
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:35,000
I make myself happy first.

549
00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:39,330
Do you never care about the feelings of others?

550
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:45,300
I barely care about my own feelings, why would I care about others'?

551
00:44:48,190 --> 00:44:51,150
I'm not going to bring you along to visit clients from now on.

552
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:53,890
Why not? But...

553
00:44:53,890 --> 00:44:56,750
If I wasn't here this time, you never would've been able to get Director Mei on board.

554
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:58,540
That was some odd coincidence.

555
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:00,770
I was using my capabilities to speak for me!

556
00:45:00,770 --> 00:45:03,280
You don't understand how to socialize at all.

557
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:06,220
I'm just too lazy to be fake.

558
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:11,610
Besides, do you think those clients are stupid?

559
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:13,430
That they can't see through your tricks?

560
00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:17,020
Instead of letting them see through you, you might as well take the initiative and pull out the big guns.

561
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:19,220
Beat them until they become obedient to you.

562
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:22,260
Then business will come to you with ease.

563
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:25,870
Where did you learn all these principals from?

564
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:28,600
It's in my genes.

565
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:34,950
However, some clients really do get convinced by your methods.

566
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:37,810
Most clients.

567
00:45:37,810 --> 00:45:41,500
Older Sister, that's why the next time you go on a trip, bring me along.

568
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,420
The two of us can fight side-by-side.

569
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:46,240
No one will be able to beat us!
