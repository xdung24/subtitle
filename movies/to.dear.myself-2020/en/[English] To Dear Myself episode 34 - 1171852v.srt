[To Dear Myself]

00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,170
[Episode 34]

3
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,110
GM Pan, have you come back?

4
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:51,300
- I came back. I have time on Friday. Come to my office to talk. 
 - Okay.

5
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,450
What's wrong? You start your diet again?

6
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:11,880
- I want to break up with He Mu. 
 - Aren't you happy with him?

7
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:14,710
I'm happy with his money.

8
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:18,370
- Isn't it enough? 
 - But he is like a robot.

9
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,690
I feel like I'm becoming a robot being together with him.

10
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,880
Do you love him?

11
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,100
What's love?

12
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,740
You and Chen Yiming were in love before, right?

13
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,350
But you broke up in the end.

14
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,880
Don't mention my relationship.

15
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:41,090
So, love is not important. Money is the most important.

16
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,130
Since you think money is the most important,

17
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:49,010
you've got what you want. Why are you still not happy?

18
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:54,120
But every time I date him, I feel I am in a math class.

19
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:58,820
Every time I send him Wechat, I feel I'm doing math homework.

20
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:04,080
It sounds painful to you.

21
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:08,990
When others date guys, they will receive cosmetics, bags, and shoes.

22
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,320
What I got are Excel sheets, bar graphs, and pie charts.

23
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,890
I don't have much time left.

24
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,550
I must break up with him!

25
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,550
You are late.

26
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,290
It's 10 mins today.

27
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,600
You are down today.

28
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,330
Yes.

29
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:16,480
Appropriate exercise, music, and self-suggestion could help with moodiness.

30
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,410
- In addition— 
 - He Mu.

31
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:24,250
We've been together for a while. Do you think we are compatible?

32
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,870
What a coincidence. I also want to talk about this with you.

33
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,610
You also felt this?

34
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:37,570
Feel? I don't trust feelings.

35
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:39,570
I only trust data.

36
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,660
That's also okay.

37
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,800
Xiao Ling, I'm very cautious about selecting a partner.

38
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:58,510
Five years ago, I made a plan with four categories,

39
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,600
nine programs and eighty-seven indexes in all for my future life partner.

40
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:06,160
I didn't do well for sure.

41
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:12,490
After the inspection of these days, for these eighty-seven indexes, you got sixty full marks.

42
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:15,420
7-90 points, 8-80 points,

43
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:19,410
6-70 points, 3-60 points, and you only failed 3.

44
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I did very well?

45
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:26,340
You are far from well.

46
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,950
Excuse me.

47
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:37,300
But this score makes me confirm that you are my future life partner.

48
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,730
You... What do you mean?

49
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:51,680
Since we have made it clear, I hope the communication between us doesn't need to stay at the "getting to know each other " level.

50
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:59,060
Instead, we should take more time and effort to discuss our wedding and marriage.

51
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:01,800
You...

52
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:10,300
You... You... Are you proposing to me?

53
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,700
You can say this.

54
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:22,230
But among those three fails, one is self-emotion management.

55
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:26,080
I hope you can work hard to improve this in the future.

56
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:30,870
I will also improve and enrich myself in all aspects.

57
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:36,270
I hope we can become perfect partners for each other.

58
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,500
Let's eat.

59
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,020
Let's eat.

60
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:51,800
Didn't I come here to break up with you?

61
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:56,890
Please come in.

62
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,630
I don't eat these. I'm on diet.

63
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,590
These are for your son.

64
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:12,590
I made some for Mengmeng as well when I made cakes for Yuwei.

65
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,600
The oil, eggs, and flour are the best.

66
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:20,360
Feel free to eat them.

67
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:23,640
- Thank you. 
 - I will leave now.

68
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,770
Zhizhi,

69
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:37,270
don't start by introducing your own product immediately when you meet clients.

70
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,160
Talk about their product first.

71
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:43,710
Thank you, Director Yuan.

72
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,700
- What's next? 
 - Put some vegetable.

73
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,800
This is also a vegetable. There are a lot. Shall we put them all in?

74
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,890
Yes.

75
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:02,750
- All? 
 - Yes. 
 - Then continue, right?

76
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,600
All right.

77
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,300
Mom, you're back!

78
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:14,160
Did you eat?

79
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,330
Yuwei finished. I was waiting for you.

80
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:21,860
- Don't wait for me. 
 - I must wait.

81
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,480
- Did you take the report from the hospital? 
 - Yes.

82
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,340
How was it?

83
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:52,830
The indexes are normal now. The doctor said it was okay as long as I take medicine on time and pay attention to food and daily health.

84
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:57,650
Then I don't need to worry about you.

85
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,170
What's this for?

86
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:15,380
I got paid today.

87
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:18,590
Sit!

88
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:23,620
I can't drink. So I'll use juice.

89
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,030
What's this for?

90
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,060
Zhizhi, when I thought of before,

91
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:38,790
how muddled I was. I treated you like that.

92
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,110
Sorry.

93
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:44,260
It's already in the past.

94
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:56,090
Zhizhi, give me another chance. Let's start our life over.

95
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,560
Yuwei,

96
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:11,290
dad and mom are talking with each other. Can you go to your room to play?

97
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:13,250
Okay!

98
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:17,800
Go.

99
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:47,780
Liu Yang,

100
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:52,830
let's divorce.

101
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:00,650
Are you still angry with me?

102
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,010
I already broke up with her!

103
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,170
It has nothing to do with that.

104
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:08,910
Then why?

105
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:13,170
I don't love you anymore.

106
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,940
Impossible.

107
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:24,770
If you don't love me, why didn't you leave me and still take care of me?

108
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,500
We've been married awhile.

109
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:39,100
You were depressed, you got sick. Taking care of you is what I should do.

110
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,360
Now that you are well and have found a job, I don't have any obligations anymore.

111
00:11:56,790 --> 00:12:01,650
Even if you don't love me, we still have Yuwei.

112
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,680
If we divorce, how can we take care of Yuwei?

113
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,000
I can take care of Yuwei well.

114
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:09,960
Yuwei is only 4 years old.

115
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,720
Don't you think it's too cruel for her?

116
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:19,770
I don't want to sacrifice myself for Yuwei anymore.

117
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:29,100
Zhizhi, before you said you had a happy life,

118
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,970
now you feel suffocated with me.

119
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,370
Zhizhi,

120
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,430
let's not get a divorce.

121
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:44,650
I swear, I won't do that stupid thing again.

122
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:48,030
I will cherish you.

123
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:51,640
I'm not the old Liu Yang anymore.

124
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:55,490
I'm not the old Zhang Zhizhi anymore.

125
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:10,800
Zhizhi, how about we calm down and think about it?

126
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,400
Don't make decisions too quickly.

127
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,200
I've already thought about it very clearly.

128
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,430
Zhizhi...

129
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,830
- Zhizhi. 
 - Liu Yang

130
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,970
if you still appreciate what I did for you,

131
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,900
then agree to my decision.

132
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:59,660
Am I this bad in your eyes?

133
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:03,350
It's nothing to do with you.

134
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,920
It was me that was terrible before.

135
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:15,780
These are not angry words.

136
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:18,030
I really think in this way.

137
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,630
I don't want to live like before.

138
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,600
Yuwei will be with me. I will take the apartment.

139
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:41,380
When I have enough money, I will repay some for you.

140
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,600
Look! I made it myself!

141
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:58,420
Amazing! I will give you a sip of juice as a bonus, okay?

142
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:07,760
- Yuwei, you made it by yourself? Dad didn't help you?
 - Yes.

143
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,560
Yuwei is excellent!

144
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,300
Yuwei,

145
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:23,010
you should also be like this in the future. No matter what you do, finish it by yourself. Okay?

146
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,000
Let's have lunch together.

147
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:44,100
No need. I will visit a client during lunchtime.

148
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,770
By the way, your things...

149
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:51,700
I will tidy up my dorm today and come to move them tomorrow.

150
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:58,320
If you want to see Yuwei, any time is okay. Just tell me in advance.

151
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,170
Goodbye.

152
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,590
Thank you.

153
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:50,760
You can go back to do your work.

154
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,900
I just got this.

155
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,300
Is he Pan Zhiyong's trusted subordinate?

156
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:24,660
This is what Xiaqiang gave to me. He is hired by me.

157
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,960
- Laidianle. 
 - Li Siyu is the owner. 
 - I know it.

158
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,810
Do we really need to do that?

159
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:05,340
- We don't have another choice. 
 - Over more than ten years, he is always the soul of Lubao.

160
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:09,630
Lubao won't have today without him.

161
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:17,790
He was correct before doesn't mean he is correct now and in the future.

162
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:50,000
Who proposed it?

163
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:52,720
Wang Ziru.

164
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,600
What does she want to do, huh?

165
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,760
She only has 23% of the shares. She wants to impeach me?

166
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,180
How long has she been here?

167
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:07,160
This is my company. This is the territory that I built!

168
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:35,470
Now the company is at a critical moment.

169
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:41,980
There are lots of things to do. We put this issue aside for now.

170
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:45,870
Now I'm afraid we can't.

171
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Okay.

172
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:53,440
- Then let's accept the challenge. 
 - Okay.

173
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,270
I'll go back to my work.

174
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:06,760
¥300 for gasoline at number 11.

175
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,440
Insufficient Balance.

I will pay cash.

179

 - Yes.

Right now, my funds are very tight.

199
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:00,170
I'll probably be dead on the way to becoming David.

200

Then you have to rapidly grow!

That way, I can brag about you with others.

Lately, I've been negotiating a ¥100,000 advertisement.

203
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:12,150
If it succeeds, then I will no longer be afraid.

[A warm welcome to LuBao's shareholders coming for the shareholders meeting.]

209

It is on the right side.

210
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:34,900
Come on in.

211
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:37,320
GM Wang, hello, please come this way.

Hello, please come in.

Hello, this way please.

214
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,080
GM Wang, this way.

215
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,530
This way, please.

216
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:49,400
Please come this way.

217
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:52,710
GM Wang.

218
00:24:58,370 --> 00:24:59,260
This way, please.

219
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,790
- Sister Yuan. 
 - Come in.

220
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,430
I've cleaned up the leftover items from Li Siyu's office.

221
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,300
What should we do with the things she left?

222
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:10,790
Okay, find a place to put everything first.

223
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:16,630
I'll put it here.

224
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,900
- Okay, put it there. 
 - Then I'll leave now.

[Chinese Restaurant Membership Card]

227
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:01,720
At the time, I rejected her offers to buy.

228
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:05,510
Later, her younger sister went and bought them.

229
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,360
Why did she do that?

230
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:13,630
Director Yuan, in reality, Sister Siyu never saw you as an enemy.

231
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:20,380
She came at me with blows over an order.

232
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,800
She did that because of me.

233
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:27,990
Yes, I remember now.

234
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:33,520
At that time, Liu Yang was still my husband.

235
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:39,890
I'm sorry, I only knew after.

236
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,270
Don't apologize. It's all in the past.

237
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:49,320
At that time, I was forced to

238
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:52,610
use some unwanted methods.

239
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:58,320
As a salesperson, I understand.

240
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:06,310
At times, I can't even face myself.

241
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,200
It can't be easy for you.

242
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:11,890
Is it easy for anyone?

243
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,600
Even including Li Siyu.

244
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:33,870
Sister Siyu, you came back again?

 - Hey, hey, hey! 
  [A warm welcome to LuBao's shareholders coming for the shareholders meeting.]

247
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:42,640
- Why is Sister Siyu back? 
 - I don't know.

248
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:48,680
Hi, Sister Siyu?

249
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,770
- I'm looking for GM Pan. 
 - Oh, GM Pan is in a stockholder meeting.

250
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,940
- It's still not over? 
 - Not yet.

251
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:57,000
- Then I'll wait for him. 
 - Here, you can sit over there.

252
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,470
Sister Siyu.

253
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:14,640
If we analyze the company's business performance and the current situation of the industry,

254
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:18,750
then you'll realize, Lubao is on the edge of a cliff!

255
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:23,910
And the person who has brought the company to such a wary situation financially is CEO Pan!

256
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:34,020
For the future of the company and also for everyone's interest, I suggest dismissing GM Pan from the board.

257
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,420
And also dismiss him from the chairman of the board!

258
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:45,350
As the company's shareholder, I support President Wang's suggestion.

259
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:56,210
I respect each stockholder and the regulations; however,

260
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,570
I'll take the responsibility to tell you that

261
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:04,570
in our current circumstances, if the core group is removed from their posts,

262
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:09,230
then everyone sitting here's interests might not be guaranteed.

263
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:19,530
Colleagues, I'd like to say two sentences.

264
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:26,150
For so many years, how much effort has GM Pan made for Lubao's development?  You all see, right?

265
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:35,200
Now, these people who play with capital want to kick GM Pan out and take Lubao away from us by using their money.

266
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:38,510
I absolutely cannot agree!

267
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:43,200
How can you force GM Pan to quit? He made the biggest contribution to the company!

268
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:46,550
He also owns the most shares of the company. It's not your turn to talk!

269
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:51,260
Everyone,

270
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:58,190
these past few years the company has consistently not paid dividends. Have you ever wondered

271
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,100
exactly why that is?

272
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,900
This is the company's strategy. Do you understand it?

273
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:16,700
GM Pan, please explain why you gave ¥300,000 to the Laidianle company.

274
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:25,930
There is nothing to explain. I tried to open up the down-stream product for Lubao.

275
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:29,100
That sum of money was never discussed in a board meeting,

276
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,600
a stockholder meeting, or even a corporate meeting.

277
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:35,700
You just signed something and gave away all of that money.

278
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:42,240
- That's because I think this investment is very cost-effective. 
 - Since it's an investment, where is the business plan?

279
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,840
What's the return on investments? Have you evaluated the risks?

280
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:46,990
Where is the report of project feasibility?

281
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:54,030
When you make investments you can't just look at reports and numbers. You also have to courage

282
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:56,130
and  insight.

283
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:58,510
Lubao has gotten to today.

284
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,800
Do you still not understand this?

285
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:05,240
Do you dare to tell everyone who the founder of Laidianle is?

286
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:14,000
There's nothing bad to say about it. Li Siyu.

287
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:16,060
You all know her business talent.

288
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:28,330
¥300,000 obscurely disappeared, and you don't have any explanation.

289
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:30,230
This was under your supervision.

290
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:34,890
Spending shareholders' money freely, this is your courage?

291
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,980
To people who seriously impacted Lubao's branding,

292
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:42,950
you not only don't punish her strictly but also invest in her.

293
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:46,100
That's your insight.

294
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:48,990
Pan Zhiyong,

295
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:56,530
his chaotic management, defective capability,  and inferior personality

296
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,300
don't deserve our trust anymore!

Siyu, this is what you had left in your old office. The admins put it together.

299
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,870
I want to apologize to you.

300
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:39,340
Didn't we call it even?

301
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:43,870
There are some things, now that I think about them, that I feel very ashamed of.

302
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:47,030
If I don't apologize, I can't live with myself.

303
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:49,710

305
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:56,510
I'm sorry.

306
00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:02,010
Sister Yuan, I also have things I need to apologize to you for.

307
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:04,150
You're right for fighting to get ahead.

308
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:10,530
Even though your perseverance threatened my position, I should have persevered more,

309
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,860
rather than using little cheating methods.

310
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:21,300
I wanted to say, the thing with Meiyi Group,

311
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:24,900
I didn't come out and stand up for you.

312
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:34,540
I believe if I hadn't changed the date of the order, then you would've come out and said something for me.

313
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:44,940
Siyu, I also take responsibility for that.

314
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:52,400
Sister Yuan, you'll always be my best mentor.

315
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:56,560
I will try.

316
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,620
I'll only teach you how to be good, not bad.

[Shareholders'  temporary conference]

318
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:26,150
I respect the outcome of the shareholders' vote.

I respect everyone's end decision.

320
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:37,000
But I want to say, you're wrong.

There will be one day when you pay the price for your vote today.

You'll regret your decision today.

323
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:56,770
President Wang just promised that by capital operation,

324
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:04,680
in a very short time, she can make everyone's property increase four even five times in value.

325
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:10,310
I believe she has this ability.

326
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:18,550
But have you thought about the inflation lacking the real value support?

327
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,800
How far can it go?

328
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,270
Come in.

329
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:25,740
Manager Yuan and Sister Siyu, look at your phones.

330
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:26,860
What's up?

331

GM Pan has been overthrown.

332
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:37,100
It's not easy to make money by working in an industry. 

333
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:41,970
But doing business, we do it not to just make money,

334
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:47,160
we need to seek long-term development in a competition.

335
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:53,640
Business is business. I'm not ashamed to talk about making money. But we should make money for all of the people.

336
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:59,200
For a company, if the industry is rising then its economy is rising.

00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:07,200
I insist that self-dependent innovation 

339
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:12,380
and the core technology are the right way to go for a company.

340
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:17,110
Honestly doing business without distractions

341
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:19,550
is a company's duty. 

342
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:26,830
All the speculations and packaging will be gone eventually!

this is not the result in the end.

346
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,900
I will come back!

347
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:40,990
I firmly believe that the way I set for Lubao,

348
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:46,030
although it's tough and slow, it is sustainable!

349
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:58,080
[Green Treasure]

350
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:12,650
GM Pan, I'm sorry.

351
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:17,120
It's not your fault.

352
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,070
I also have some problems.

353
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:28,110
The shareholders who supported me, in the end, voted for the others.

354
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:34,660
All in all, it was me that got you into trouble.

355
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:41,000
When talking about equity cooperation,

356
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,400
Wang Ziru was scheming today.

357
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:50,100
I promised her 23% of shares.

358
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:53,020
It fit in exactly with her wishes.

359
00:38:55,610 --> 00:39:00,920
I still can't believe why Sister Ziru would do this.

360
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,420
How did you guys meet?

361
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:13,410
From a car accident, she didn't ask us to pay for her car and used her own insurance.

362
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:20,450
She helped you for no reason,

363
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:23,070
you didn't think there was something else to it?

364
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:27,550
You mean—

365
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:34,080
she was using me to get to Lubao?

366
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,500
What do you think?

367
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:44,060
I work in sales.

368
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,370
Which company?

369
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:50,330
That new power battery company?

370
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:52,100
You know it?

371
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,830
I don't need you to repair my car.

372
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:55,590
You don't need to pay for it.

373
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:58,890
But it can't be...

374
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:11,790
Looking at it now, that rumor is true.

375
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:14,590
What rumor?

376
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:21,460
At the time, I was talking to three companies about getting an investment.

377
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:26,690
Huaan and Huyun left the discussion in the end.

378
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:35,840
Someone told me that they were getting harassed and pressured by people from Tianyie company.

379
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,590
I didn't really believe it at the time.

380
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:43,740
Because I didn't tell her who the other two companies were.

381
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:47,230
She didn't pursue further to ask.

382
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:54,820
GM Pan can appoint you as Lubao's Sales Director. This makes me more confident in Lubao's management team.

383
00:40:55,360 --> 00:41:00,760
By the way, have your executives met with the other two companies that are trying to invest?

384
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:02,820
You mean Huaan and Huyin?

385
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:11,110
She knew...

386
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:14,490
Not possible. How could she have known?

387
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,190
I told her.

388
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:28,250
How do I have such a stupid subordinate like you!

389
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:32,770
GM Pan, I'm sorry.

390
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:34,130
Don't cry!

391
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:39,440
You continue to cry and I won't see you again!

392
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,200
I won't cry.

393
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,980
I won't cry.

394
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:56,990
I won't accept defeat.

395
00:41:57,850 --> 00:42:02,090
I must get Lubao back.

396
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:09,940
GM Pan, what do you want me to do?

397
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:16,160
You, just take care of your own business.

398
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:22,750
By the way, the second round of funding for Laidianle, I can't do it now.

399
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,870
You have to think of a way yourself, okay?

400
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:30,490
Rest assured. I will not admit defeat.

401
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:38,770
[95590]

402
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:01,130
[Sir, your mortgage has been overdue for many times during this half of the year. If this situation continues, the bank will take legal means to safeguard the rights and interests.]

403
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:29,270
Teacher Chen, I have approved the business cooperation plan.

404
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:33,500
But my boss wants to meet you tomorrow to finalize the agreement. Do you have time tomorrow?

405
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:34,830
Yes, I'm available.

406
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:41,690
He will have a meeting in a hotel. He has a few minutes during the break.

407
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:43,090
It would be the perfect time to talk to you.

408
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:45,980
Okay.

409
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,260
See you tomorrow
