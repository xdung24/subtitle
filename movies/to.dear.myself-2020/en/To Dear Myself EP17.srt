[To Dear Myself]

00:01:29,125 --> 00:01:31,125
[Ep17]

3
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,760
My virile roommate called his dad after he went back

4
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,640
He said

5
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,239
Dad, my classmates go to lecture by subway

6
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:44,959
Only I drive Ferrari 

7
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,879
His dad was so furious

8
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:47,920
His dad said

9
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,319
Hello, son

10
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,599
No way

11
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:53,040
We can't let Europeans look down on us

12
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,319
How much is the subway?

13
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,200
I will transfer you 100 million now

14
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:56,719
Is it enough?

15
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:57,760
Really?

16
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,400
Of course it's fake

17
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,319
Xiaoling, to be honest

18
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:08,960
Foreign upstarts' lifestyle is so unbelievale

19
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,240
 for Chinese upstarts like me

20
00:02:10,758 --> 00:02:11,599
Really?

21
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:14,075
My goal now is to make more money

22
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,275
In the future I will buy a subway for my son

23
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:26,319
Xiaoling

24
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:32,100
You look like Duffy Sheridan's girls when you smile

25
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:34,080
A bit of art

26
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:36,560
Aloof and unrestrained

27
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,120
And a bit cunning

28
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:39,520
Really?

29
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,240
I have a present for you

30
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:50,240
What?

31
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:06,200
This morning, in the park, the leaf fell on my shoulder for no reason

32
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,599
I thought

33
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:13,759
It looked so like you

34
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,039
For no reason

35
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:17,710
You break into my heart

36
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,875
So I decide to give it to you

37
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,840
Thank you

38
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,039
I will treasure the gift

39
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:37,879
Hello, sir

40
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:38,639
You are here to buy a car?

41
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,680
Yeah

42
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,400
Come in, please

43
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:40,960
Ok

44
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:47,560
Do you have humanity?

45
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,919
I was dumped

46
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:51,028
I thought I would pick Gu Xiaoling up

47
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:53,120
Now she ignores me

48
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:54,375
Say something

49
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:56,599
Do you have any sympathy?

50
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:57,800
It's ok

51
00:03:58,475 --> 00:04:01,479
Sir, it's the latest new energy car

52
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:03,039
It uses Lubao's battery

53
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,599
With a long battery life

54
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:06,120
It can reach 410 kilometers

55
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,400
Fast charge

56
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:09,725
It only needs an hour

57
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:18,319
Here is the production process for charging and discharging

58
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:24,250
Put the plate of the battery in sink first after assembly

59
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,560
Then it will charge and discharge

60
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,160
Compared with the previous external chemical production process

61
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,300
It is more eco-friendly 

62
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:47,959
President Wang

63
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,639
Yiming

64
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:55,959
What's this?

65
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,920
Lubao's valuation offer is too high

66
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:01,000
The main reason is they are optimistic

67
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 about Lubao III's future market prospects

68
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,759
Lubao III hasn't reached a mass market yet

69
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,300
I have made surveys on customer trials

70
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:12,975
I think these data might be helpful for you to

71
00:05:12,975 --> 00:05:16,240
reassess Lubao III's future market prospects

72
00:05:20,175 --> 00:05:22,319
Why do you think of the survey?

73
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:25,868
Because I think you will need it in the next negotiation

74
00:05:30,825 --> 00:05:36,579
I also checked planning department's previous evaluation

75
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:38,519
I don't think it is very accurate

76
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,500
So I reevaluate it with my experience

77
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,079
This is my evaluation report

78
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:54,879
Yiming

79
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,160
I have told you

80
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:04,160
You don't need to participate in this project

81
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:12,560
But I want to tell everyone in the group

82
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,875
I am planning director in Tianyi Group now

83
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:17,399
I have responsibilities and obligations 

84
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,130
to prove my ability and my professional ethics to my company

85
00:06:27,475 --> 00:06:32,040
I have studied Lubao group's A round of investment

86
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:35,650
I made a roughl analysis on Pan Zhiyong's character

87
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:36,895
and his psychological construction

88
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:39,600
Look

89
00:06:42,225 --> 00:06:46,040
I think it may help you negotiate with him

90
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,319
Yiming

91
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:00,879
You are competent

92
00:07:01,425 --> 00:07:03,040
And you have exceeded my expectation

93
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,319
Thank you, president Wang

94
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:09,240
I'll go back to work now

95
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:10,639
Ok

96
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,319
Ok

97
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,319
Come

98
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,480
Thank you, everyone

99
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,079
To all of you

100
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:30,920
Liu

101
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:34,875
After the bidding, you will be promoted as vice director, right?

102
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,519
Yes  -Absolutely

103
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:37,839
So what are we waiting for?

104
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:39,839
Let's congratulate on Liu now

105
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:40,959
Come...

106
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:42,000
Congratulations

107
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,879
Congratulations

108
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:45,199
It's not confirmed yet

109
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,519
Drink first

110
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:47,120
Liu

111
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,959
Yes, drink it

112
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:48,800
I will

113
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,120
But you can't talk nonsense to others

114
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:52,839
Ok

115
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:53,480
Bottom up

116
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:58,360
Great... Cheers

117
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,079
Cheers

118
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:18,639
It's so late

119
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,360
Why Liu Yang isn't back?

120
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,079
Mom, he's an adult

121
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:24,920
He knows what he should do

122
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:25,839
Don't worry

123
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:27,920
Or...

124
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:31,120
You should call him

125
00:08:31,425 --> 00:08:33,519
He will call me if necessary

126
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,279
Mom, I need to work tomorrow

127
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,399
Good night

128
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:04,014
Bidding is not over yet

129
00:09:05,225 --> 00:09:09,600
We need to fight till the last moment

130
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:11,440
Liu

131
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:13,279
Ok

132
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,320
Drink

133
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,159
Ok

134
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:22,320
Come

135
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:25,080
Brother Yang, drink less

136
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:31,039
You call him brother Yang?

137
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:33,080
You two are so close

138
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,080
Let me tell you

139
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:39,759
Wei Yayun

140
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,720
Is my sister

141
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:44,919
None of you are allowed to bully her

142
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,919
Won't...

143
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:49,679
Yayun

144
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,200
Drink with me

145
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,240
Come, drink

146
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:54,960
Closer

147
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,720
Come...

148
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,200
Drink

149
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,399

Sister Yun

151
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,000
Thank you

152
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,000
Brother Yang

153
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:08,399
Thank you

154
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,840
Wait...

155
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,360

Cross-cupped wine

159
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,080
I have told you 

160
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,519
You can't bully her

161
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,600
Cross-cupped wine

162
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,039
Come, bottom up

163
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:37,559
Bottom up

164
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:40,279
Cross-cupped wine

00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:15,000
Sorry, the subscriber you dialed can not be connected

166
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,500
Sorry, the subscriber you dialed can not be connected

167
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,240
Yayun, are you ok?

168
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,519
I'm fine...

169
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,320
I will leave Liu to you

170
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,799
Don't worry, bye

171
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,600
Brother Yang

172
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,360
Brother Yang, are you ok?

173
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:34,600
I'm sorry

174
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:38,240
Brother Yang

175
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,600
What are you talking about?

176
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:41,919
Be careful

177
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,559
Brother Yang, sit down for a while

178
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,039
Be careful

179
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:01,399
Sister Yun

180
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,720
You know what

181
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,799
Today, I just want to celebrate with you alone

182
00:12:15,325 --> 00:12:23,650
You should take the big credit for the bidding

183
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,600
Brother Yang

184
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,840
You are welcome

185
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,960
Brother Yang, you...

186
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,799
Why are you looking at me like this?

187
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,559
Sister Yun

188
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,799
You are so beautiful

189
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,600
Phone number 6745 grabbed the car?

190
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,600
Phone number 6745

191
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:27,720
Yes

192
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,000
Let's go

193
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,320
Brother Yang, be careful

194
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:52,919
Finally

195
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,519
Hello

196
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,360
Aunt

197
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,559
I'm Liu Yang's colleague

198
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:02,080
He's drunk

199
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,919
I am taking him home by taxi

200
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,399
Ok...

201
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:06,559
Thank you...

202
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,759
It's ok...

203
00:14:08,225 --> 00:14:10,279
Aunt, please tell me the address

204
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,919
No. 85, South Garden,  Jincheng Avenue

205
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:15,279
Thank you

206
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:16,679
It's ok

207
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:55,840
Almost get there

208
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,879
Why are you so drunk?

209
00:14:58,879 --> 00:14:59,720
Aunt  -Mom

210
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:01,879
Oh my God

211
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:02,399
Be careful

212
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:05,799
We had a celebration

213
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:07,440
Mr. Liu Yang is happy so he gets drunk

214
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,080
Ok

215
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,559
He needs some honey water

216
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:11,200
And he can't catch cold at night

217
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,519
Ok, thank you

218
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:14,919
Mom, let me introduce to you

219
00:15:16,175 --> 00:15:19,559
My colleague Yayun

220
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,559
She is very nice

221
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:22,840
Thank you

222
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:25,559
Be careful

223
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:26,840
Be careful, brother Yang  -It's okay

224
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:27,799
Let me help you

225
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,679
No need, it's ok

226
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,480
No need

227
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,799
Look, your clothes get dirty now

228
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,759
Come upstairs to wash it

229
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:40,480
No need

230
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,519
I need to go back

231
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:42,240
This...

232
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,759
Mr. Liu Yang's bag and phone

233
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,440
I have to go now, aunt

234
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,159
Ok...

235
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:52,039
I won't see you off

236
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:53,600
It's ok

237
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:58,700
Next time we will celebrate it, only two of us

238
00:15:59,320 --> 00:15:59,919
Ok

239
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:01,159
Brother Yang, good night

240
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:02,975
Stop it, go home

241
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,000
Goodbye aunt

242
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,639
Bye

243
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:05,399
Bye

244
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:06,039
Goodbye, brother Yang

245
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:06,559
Thank you

246
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:07,120
It's ok

247
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,480
Let's go...

248
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,519
Bye

249
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,000
Why do you drink so much?

250
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,399
I am happy

251
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:14,519
Happy?

252
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:16,240
How will you explain to her?

253
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:30,200
What's wrong?

254
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:30,840
Come, give me a hand

255
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,440
How much did you drink?

256
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,240
Come...

257
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,159
Be careful

258
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:37,360
Be careful

259
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:40,960
Mom, water

260
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,080
Get him some water

261
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,480
Zhang Zhizhi

262
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,679
I will be promoted to deputy director soon

263
00:16:49,025 --> 00:16:51,840
You will be Mrs. deputy director

264
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,120
Yang, you are going to be promoted to deputy director?

265
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,159
Brilliant

266
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:58,159
Hurry, he needs water

267
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:00,919
Do you know?

268
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:06,125
How much long-suffering I have been through these years?

269
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,200
How much torture I have taken?

270
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:16,519
But now I have made it

271
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:19,240
I get what I desire

272
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,925
You should stop being mentally fragile

273
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:26,599
Stop making a fuss

274
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,640
Try to be a good wife

275
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,759
Yuwei...

276
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:43,480
What are you doing?

277
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,160
I want to tell the good news to Yuwei

278
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,519
She is sleeping

279
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,240
Just wake her up

280
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,880
Don't be so ridiculous

281
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,680
What's wrong?

282
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,799
Did I do something wrong?

283
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:00,440
I can tell you

284
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:03,960
I am the most capable dad in the world

285
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:08,039
I am the most capable husband in the whole world

286
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:11,750
I am the most capable son in the whole world

287
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,000
What do you want?

288
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,160
I just want to ask Yuwei

289
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,759
if I am the best dad in the world

290
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,960
I ask her

291
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,960
I am...

292
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,559
Be your director

293
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:35,480
Mom

294
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:41,119
What?  Go on sleeping, baby

295
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:43,480
I want dad  -Come

296
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,480
Dad is not back yet

297
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:54,599
Wash

298
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,839
Bloody wife

299
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:01,960
Ridiculous

300
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,875
Don't know to take care of the husband

301
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,160
Look

302
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,480
Come...

303
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,880
Son, come, sit well

304
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,640
Look

305
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,599
Liu Yang

306
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,680
Brother Yang

307
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,350
When you were kissing me, you catptured my heart

308
00:19:56,839 --> 00:19:57,720
Full?

309
00:19:58,319 --> 00:19:58,960
Let's go

310
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:02,720
Come

311
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,400
Goodbye, grandma, dad

312
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:17,200
Ok, good bye

313
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:18,599
Be careful

314
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:33,440
I need to go to work now

315
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:33,920
Wait

316
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:35,079
Sit down

317
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:36,880
Sit down

318
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,720
What's wrong?

319
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:45,119
Who is the woman that sent you back last night?

320
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:45,880
Colleague

321
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,000
Colleague

322
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,680
I think she cares about you

323
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:54,839
An ordinary colleague

324
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:56,000
Let me tell you

325
00:20:57,675 --> 00:21:00,839
I'm not satisfied with Zhizhi

326
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:03,680
But she is your wife, after all

327
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,559
You have Yuwei

328
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,799
You need to be upright

329
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,400
You can't do anything wrong to her

330
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,119
Did you hear me?

331
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:10,000
Yes

332
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,759
I need to go for work now

333
00:21:30,725 --> 00:21:33,160
I don't know what I did last night

334
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,400
Did I do something wrong to you?

335
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:38,200
No, brother Yang

336
00:21:39,425 --> 00:21:42,480
On the contrary, I feel very happy

337
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,370
I finally know your heart and my heart are the same

338
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:51,759
No... you may

339
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,519
Maybe you have some misunderstandings

340
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:06,559
As long as you allow me to love you

341
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,519
I don't care

342
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,839
Impossible

343
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:13,279
I have a family

344
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:18,279
For you

345
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,119
I am willing to do anything

346
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:23,079
So many people are watching us in office

347
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,559
We...

348
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:25,519
I can understand

349
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:27,640
I know

350
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:30,839
Don't worry

351
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,839
You can call me brother Yang

352
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:36,200
I can call you sister Yun

353
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:39,079
That's all

354
00:22:40,675 --> 00:22:43,759
This is the limit

355
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,559
You are on diet, right?

356
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:04,519
Why do you eat so much?

357
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:06,640
The nuts are low-fat and delicious

358
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,160
I eat it as breakfast in the morning

359
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,599
I will play basketball with Liu Yang

360
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,599
Will you come?

361
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:20,319
Is there anything you want to tell him?

362
00:23:21,319 --> 00:23:23,000
I'm with Zhizhi now

363
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,839
No need

364
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:38,920
He is an art curator

365
00:23:39,325 --> 00:23:41,000
He also has art investment company

366
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,240
I think he is very rich

367
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:44,319
But we have known each other for more than a month

368
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,200
He sends me only leaf and stone

369
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,160
Even more, he gave me a button

370
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,119
Button?

371
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:52,440
He took it off from his old shirt

372
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,519
He says the button knows his heartbeat

373
00:23:54,519 --> 00:23:55,599
So he sends it to me

374
00:23:56,599 --> 00:23:57,759
Very romantic

375
00:23:57,759 --> 00:23:59,559
But I am not interested in romance

376
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,799
I need something practical or fashionable

377
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:03,839
Or things that could keep value 

378
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,359
Or something vulgar

379
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,880
So is there anything to enlighten him?

380
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,519
Just be straightforward

381
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:13,200
No

382
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,480
I am a chic female artist now

383
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:29,839
Why do you get so many drinks?

384
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:31,000
Can you drink them all?

385
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:33,000
It's just like fresh juice

386
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,960
I will drink them all

387
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,659
Artists like me need it

388
00:24:39,925 --> 00:24:41,759
I love money so much

389
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:43,240
But I have to look nonchalant

390
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,279
It's not easy for me

391
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:49,732
I think you should expose your mammonism properly

392
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,720
I'm afraid to scare him away

393
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,200
If he is rich, he won't be scared away

394
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,720
If he is scared away, it means he is not rich

395
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,599
Makes sense

396
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:10,759
Hello, do you have VIP card?

397
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:12,359
Zhizhi, vip card

398
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:23,160
Zhizhi

399
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:26,799
Zhizhi

400
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:29,075
Did Liu Yang bully you recently?

401
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:33,759
Are you ok?

402
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,839
I pick up Yuwei every day

403
00:25:48,375 --> 00:25:52,240
I feel so sick of them

404
00:25:53,559 --> 00:25:55,119
I feel so bad

405
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:56,799
So ridiculous

406
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,440
Zhizhi, you're such a wimp

407
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,880
Gu Xiaoling, shut up

408
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:03,039
But Zhizhi

409
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,799
We must transfer

410
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,759
Liu Yang firmly opposed

411
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:15,359
He thinks I am mentally fragile

412
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:18,014
Thinks I am making a fuss and waste money

413
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:19,799
It has nothing to do with money

414
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:20,960
It's not mental fragility

415
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,440
It's about your dignity

416
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:26,759
Yes, that's what I mean

417
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:27,559
Sister Siyu

418
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:29,960
I just don't understand

419
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,440
Why you don't understand?

420
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,240
You're a wimp

421
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,440
You just don't...

422
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:36,960
The kindergarten is so snobbish inside and out

423
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,850
What can Yuwei learn from them?

424
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,599
Zhizhi

425
00:26:46,759 --> 00:26:48,440
No offense

426
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:52,000
I think it's wrong you transferred 

427
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,125
Yuwei to the expensive kindergarten

428
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:09,106
I was thinking as a mom, I should give her a better environment

429
00:27:10,325 --> 00:27:13,400
I just want to send her to a higher class

430
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:17,850
Have you ever thought if they will accept you?

431
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,559
Transfer Yuwei back

432
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,400
Even if you lose half of the tuition,

433
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,119
that kindergarten is much cheaper

434
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,480
I think you should remember

435
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,440
More importantly

436
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:36,000
No one will look down on you

437
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,279
No one will bully you

438
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,200
You don't have to kiss anyone's ass

439
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,240
I'll go through the transfer procedures tomorrow

440
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,350
I think, Liu Yang has a problem

441
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,119
Stop it

442
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:01,480
What's wrong?

443
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,200
His wife was so bullied

444
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,599
He could tolerate it?

445
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:06,880
Just don't get bullied

446
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,300
All of them are so snobbish

447
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,559
I just do not understand

448
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:18,250
I have convinced Gu Xiaoling to move to alley nearby my house

449
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,625
Psychologically, I am her BFF

450
00:28:23,325 --> 00:28:25,799
Why does she date a curator?

451
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:28,640
Generally speaking, if you are her BFF

452
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,519
you won't have her forever

453
00:28:30,519 --> 00:28:31,240
Why?

454
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:32,960
Pass it

455
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:38,075
Being her boyfriend is like lay-up shot

456
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:43,279
Male BFF is different

457
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,319
Male BFF is long shot

458
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,759
It's a little far from the backboard

459
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:53,640
But I may get three points

460
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:56,000
I think you should give up

461
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,480
Why should I give up?

462
00:28:59,559 --> 00:29:00,640
She looks so pretty

463
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:02,960
Haowen

464
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,640
Don't indulge in appearance

465
00:29:05,225 --> 00:29:06,839
You should know a girl's inner

466
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:10,450
Her superficial inner heart deserves

467
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:14,759
 my flamboyant personality

468
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,720
What are you sighing?

469
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:22,319
Come

470
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:28,359
Xiaoling is right

471
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:31,680
What makes me sad the most

472
00:29:33,775 --> 00:29:37,421
is I have sacrificed so much for the family and Yuwei

473
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:40,279
It's ok that he doesn't appreciate it

474
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:47,750
When I feel bad, he doesn't care about me

475
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:49,079
doesn't support me

476
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:52,240
He even think it's not a problem

477
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,960
You ask for it

478
00:29:54,119 --> 00:29:54,960
Xiaoling

479
00:29:56,319 --> 00:29:57,480
Look at you

480
00:29:57,839 --> 00:29:59,000
You don't buy clothes

481
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:01,119
You use the cheapest skincare products

482
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:03,720
You barely take taxi

483
00:30:04,575 --> 00:30:06,480
You don't take yourself seriously

484
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,440
How can you let a man see you as treasure?

485
00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:13,400
Enough is enough

486
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,400
It's also hard for Liu Yang

487
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:20,319
He needs to be cautious in office

488
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,880
He needs to have good performance

489
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,319
At the same time, he needs to please everyone

490
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:27,350
He doesn't make much money 

491
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:29,359
but he needs to solve a lot of problems

492
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,193
Xiaoling is also right

493
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:40,000
Women can't sacrifice for men

494
00:30:40,825 --> 00:30:42,799
You need to think for yourself

495
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,640
From now on, don't care about anything

496
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,200
Don't care about Liu Yang or Yuwei

497
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:52,319
You just need to get well dressed and do the makeups

498
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:54,925
I can guarantee, Liu Yang will follow you everywhere

499
00:30:56,759 --> 00:30:58,480
Yuwei is still a child

500
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,400
I need to take care of her

501
00:31:01,625 --> 00:31:06,800
After having a family, I don't know why I have so many problems

502
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,640
Don't listen to her

503
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,160
It's no use being purely beautiful

504
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,000
We need to have a career

505
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:14,960
So we won't be despised by husband

506
00:31:18,759 --> 00:31:20,160
I understand

507
00:31:20,675 --> 00:31:24,920
I want to be well-dressed

508
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:27,200
And I want to have a career

509
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,825
But after I have a family and a daughter

510
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,440
I can't do anything

511
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:40,920
Anything is possible as long as you want

512
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:43,480
You can write an application tomorrow

513
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:46,000
You can work in the sales department with me tomorrow

514
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,680
Let me think

515
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:53,250
You just don't understand why she thinks so

516
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,039
A simple reason

517
00:31:55,839 --> 00:31:56,920
She just doesn't understand

518
00:31:57,925 --> 00:32:00,400
I worked very hard every day

519
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:03,646
She is so annoying after I go home

520
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,240
She either argues with my mom,

521
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:08,400
or have a cold war with me

522
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:12,450
Now I would work overtime rather than go home

523
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:16,720
I recently read a book

524
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:20,800
Its main idea is we can't reason with wives

525
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,119
We need to affect them emotionally

526
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,119
How?

527
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:26,440
For example

528
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:28,319
Be more considerate

529
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:29,599
Think what she thinks

530
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:32,160
You just do what she wants

531
00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:35,119
Gu Xiaoling

532
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:36,960
She needs money

533
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:38,039
I can't

534
00:32:38,325 --> 00:32:41,940
So you and Gu Xiaoling can't be together

535
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,519
Liu Yang

536
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,119
Don't listen to him

537
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:46,880
It's a critical moment for you now

538
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,519
You are going to be promoted

539
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,200
You can't get in any trouble in your family

540
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:52,480
Otherwise all your efforts will be ruined

541
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,200
Yiming and Siyu are so great

542
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:00,680
Like-minded

543
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,640
You fight together

544
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:04,079
You have many common topics

545
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:12,050
Actually, Siyu and I have many problems

546
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,359
What problems?

547
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,359
We hold different ideas

548
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,000
Take a break

549
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,768
So I am right that I don't get married so soon

550
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:36,160
You are different

551
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:37,519
Brother Yiming loves you so much

552
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,799
Don't talk about you and Liu Yang

553
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,839
I want to talk about my dad and my mom

554
00:33:45,125 --> 00:33:47,519
They married because of love

555
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:52,425
But my dad got remarried several months after my mom's death

556
00:33:54,839 --> 00:33:57,400
Your dad and my mom lived very happily, right?

557
00:33:59,240 --> 00:33:59,920
Yes

558
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,319
I am also happy for him

559
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,175
But just because he is very happy now

560
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,719
I feel bad for my mom

561
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,920
You hurt me so much

562
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:18,159
Mentally fragile

563
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:19,760
You are...

564
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,639
So obvious

565
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:26,975
If aunt were still alive, she would live a happy life with uncle

566
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,320
But my aunt is gone

567
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:35,025
You can't stop uncle having a new life

568
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,679
But he started so fast

569
00:34:38,875 --> 00:34:44,079
I almost think his love for mom is fake

570
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:48,079
So now you think Chen Yiming's love for you is fake, too

571
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:48,760
No

572
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,360
Yiming loves me truely

573
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:54,900
But we don't know whether in the future he will...

574
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:57,199
You are so ridiculous

575
00:34:57,519 --> 00:34:59,760
Who can predict the future?

576
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,400
It's possible that Chen Yiming becomes a womanizer or

577
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,093
Liu Yang has an affair in the future

578
00:35:04,525 --> 00:35:09,473
You can't deny the true love now because of the uncertain future

579
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:16,199
Now we are talking

580
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:17,800
That's not all

581
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:20,559
You say, it's hard for Liu Yang

582
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,519
Chen Yiming flatters you and tries so hard to marry you

583
00:35:24,519 --> 00:35:25,559
You think it's easy for him?

584
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,960
I didn't say I won't get married

585
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,199
You don't fear marriage now?

586
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,159
I fear

587
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:39,325
But I need to overcome it by marriage

588
00:36:10,039 --> 00:36:10,800
Hello

589
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,159
Yiming

590
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,655
Tomorrow we should sign house purchasing contract with the agency

591
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:21,119
You need to think about it, right?

592
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,480
No need, I want to buy it

593
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,559
Ok

594
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,440
Come

595
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,679
Brilliant

596
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,679
Thermos mug is on sale

597
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:46,175
Thermos mug is on sale

598
00:36:46,575 --> 00:36:48,975
Brother, buy one for your love

599
00:36:49,639 --> 00:36:51,920
Thermos mug is on sale

600
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,159
Brother, it's getting cold

601
00:36:53,159 --> 00:36:55,200
Buy one, it's very cheap

602
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,425
Thermos mug is on sale

603
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:02,159
Thermos mug is on sale

604
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:02,800
Sir

605
00:37:04,519 --> 00:37:05,280
How much is it?

606
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,639
Look

607
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:07,639
It's made in German

608
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,159
Usually it costs 300 or 400 yuan

609
00:37:09,159 --> 00:37:10,679
Today it's on sale, 268

610
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:13,679
Yes, that's right

611
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:16,320
Write ten times, ok?

612
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,199
Ok

613
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:38,960
Mom

614
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,639
I throw it in the trash

615
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,719
I picked it up

616
00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:51,760
This has expired and we can't eat it

617
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,239
It's ok

618
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:55,280
Just a few days after the expiration date

619
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:56,679
No

620
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,440
I will eat

621
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:07,559
We are not rich

622
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:08,719
Throw everything

623
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:09,880
Ridiculous

624
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:16,079
Let me see, write

625
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,480
Yang, you are back

626
00:38:24,679 --> 00:38:26,119
You are back early today

627
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:27,519
Come, give it to me

628
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:29,320
Come, eat

629
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,639
It's still hot

630
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,039
Sit...

631
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,039
Dad

632
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:41,280
My pen has no ink

633
00:38:41,875 --> 00:38:44,320
I have a pen in bag, take it yourself

634
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,960
Mom, look

635
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,639
What is this?

636
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:06,760
Thermos cup

637
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:12,519
Such a beautiful thermos cup

638
00:39:12,679 --> 00:39:14,119
For whom?

639
00:39:16,519 --> 00:39:17,519
Bought for Zhizhi

640
00:39:23,159 --> 00:39:24,320
It's not enough for you

641
00:39:24,519 --> 00:39:25,840
I'll make you some sour pork

642
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:27,880
Ok

643
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:27,000
The vegetable price has gone up again

644
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,119
Yesterday the potato was 2.99 half a kilo

645
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:31,559
Today it's 3.59

646
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,360
Mom says her leg is painful

647
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:36,880
I want to buy a kneecap of magnet therapy for mom

648
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:39,320
I find a suitable one

649
00:40:39,519 --> 00:40:40,719
It's going to be on sale

650
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:43,931
Why don't you use the mug I bought for you?

651
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:45,519
I grudge it

652
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:49,500
It's just over 200 yuan

653
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,320
So expensive

654
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,159
Where did you buy it?

655
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,519
The mall in front of the subway station

656
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:55,800
Where is the invoice?

657
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:57,519
I threw it away

658
00:40:58,119 --> 00:41:01,575
That mall is much more expensive than online

659
00:41:02,119 --> 00:41:04,639
Just use it

660
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,039
Well

661
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,825
I have gone through Yuwei's transferring kindergarten procedures

662
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:20,639
It is my fault this time

663
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:22,159
We wasted some money

664
00:41:22,599 --> 00:41:25,385
Fortunately, we correct it timely 

665
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:28,519
I know I am wrong

666
00:41:29,325 --> 00:41:30,920
It won't happen again

667
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:34,639
You are right

668
00:41:35,275 --> 00:41:37,639
We are not in a circle

669
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,559
In the end, I answer for the consequences

670
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,039
It's ok

671
00:41:53,639 --> 00:41:55,000
As long as you figure it out

672
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,760
And one more thing

673
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,100
Sister Siyu wants me to work in sales department

674
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:17,480
No

675
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,360
Why?

676
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:25,360
Think, soon I will be deputy director

677
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,519
I will be busier than now

678
00:42:27,159 --> 00:42:29,075
If you work in the sales department

679
00:42:29,075 --> 00:42:31,750
who will take care of Yuwei?

680
00:42:32,599 --> 00:42:33,360
Leave her to mom?

681
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,360
You are not worried?

682
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:41,400
And I know Siyu's situation

683
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:45,599
Even Chen Yiming often says he can't stand it

684
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:46,519
Not to mention us

685
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:48,719
You are right

686
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,300
I think HR department is suitable for you

687
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,079
The salary is not high

688
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,960
But it's easy and regular

689
00:42:58,475 --> 00:43:00,679
You don't have to worry about making money

690
00:43:01,239 --> 00:43:02,000
You have me

691
00:43:06,239 --> 00:43:09,725
But women should have careers

692
00:43:15,719 --> 00:43:16,960
I am your career

693
00:43:18,239 --> 00:43:19,519
Yuwei is your career

694
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,719
Stop thinking

695
00:43:25,719 --> 00:43:28,750
We should live a life down to earth

696
00:43:32,199 --> 00:43:32,920
Ok

697
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:39,119
Wu...

698
00:43:39,639 --> 00:43:41,606
I have checked all the shortlisted companies

699
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,119
Guess what

700
00:43:43,239 --> 00:43:43,960
Say it

701
00:43:44,599 --> 00:43:46,000
The husband of my junior high school classmate 

702
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,360
works in the R&D department of Lubao

703
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:53,150
I found a photo in his Moment

704
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:58,800
Anything wrong?

705
00:44:08,039 --> 00:44:09,039
The same one

706
00:44:10,159 --> 00:44:11,280
Liu Yang's wife

707
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:11,920
Correct

708
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:13,280
Her name is Zhang Zhizhi

709
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,639
Works in HR department of Lubao

710
00:44:15,125 --> 00:44:19,675
As I know, director Li who comes for bid is her cousin

711
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:21,599
Great

712
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:23,199
Wu

713
00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:25,916
We should tell director about this early tomorrow morning

714
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:29,320
This time Liu Yang is doomed

715
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:30,199
Don't worry

716
00:44:30,875 --> 00:44:31,715
Let me process

717
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:38,400
What if Liu Yang told the director about this relationship in advance?

718
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,000
Even if he didn't

719
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:44,920
Liu Yang is just in charge of preliminary work

720
00:44:46,519 --> 00:44:49,300
Only experts have the final say in the bid

721
00:44:49,559 --> 00:44:51,325
Liu Yang can still prove his innocence

722
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,840
Then we should make water dirty

723
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,599
Zhao, you finally have learned

724
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,891
I don't want to be the receptionist

725
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:06,650
We must take the previous lessons

726
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:11,440
We can't fail again
