00:01:23,475 --> 00:01:28,975
[To Dear Myself]

2
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,900
[Ep11]

3
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:45,719
The letter is ready

4
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:47,239
It's written in Chinese and English

5
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:48,200
Only one theme

6
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,680
To ensure a happy environment for our kids

7
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:54,359
the kindergarten must dismiss Doudou

8
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:55,760
Are you back home?

9
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:57,599
Parent Association

10
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,359
Any problems?

11
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,920
Ok, you go on

12
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,240
Brother

13
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,159
You haven't left yet?

14
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,800
The latest developments in the three districts

15
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:35,120
So fast?

16
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:37,240
Mr. Liu

17
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,360
You can give me two more districts

18
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,080
Thank you

19
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,159
It's ok

20
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:05,639
Leave it to me

21
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:11,240
Is Zhao a mole?

22
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:20,520
I have checked the data

23
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:23,800
I find all the errors come from Zhao's part?

24
00:03:24,475 --> 00:03:26,680
I am sure, he is the mole

25
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:29,680
Mr. Liu

26
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,000
What should we do next?

27
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,319
I need to think about it

28
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:38,520
Go home early

29
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:39,639
I should go too

30
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,520
Ok

31
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:48,719
Doudou's mom apologized to me

32
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:51,360
She is going to resign and take care of Doudou at home

33
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,159
She promises me that Doudou will change

34
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:56,800
So should we give her more time?

35
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:58,719
No

36
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:00,800
I can't bear it anymore

37
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:04,439
This is not the first time that Doudou's parents apologize

38
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:06,120
Has Doudou changed?

39
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,479
Just ignore them

40
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,280
Yes

41
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,639
Doudou's mom is very sincere

42
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:11,439
What's the use of her sincerity?

43
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,250
I just think if we force the boy to drop out

44
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:19,319
will it affect his psychology?

45
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:22,759
You are so compassionate

46
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:26,040
You even think for Doudou's psychology

47
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:28,199
He is a bully

48
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:30,639
He is so overbearing all day

49
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,279
Think

50
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:36,480
How much psychological impact he caused for our kids

51
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:39,120
I asked Yuwei

52
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,680
Doudou is naughty and annoying

53
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,439
But he is not a bully

54
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:44,480
Yes...

55
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:48,720
My daughter Linda told me, actually Doudou has some advantages

56
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:52,675
He can take initiative to help teachers in the kindergarten

57
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,160
My son William said

58
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,120
He often walks back and forth in class

59
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,040
It affects other kids' learning

60
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:00,959
Yes

61
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:05,225
And he blocked other kids at the door of the toilet 

62
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,160
In the end, Xingxing shat in pants

63
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,600
Do you know what happened yesterday?

64
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:12,040
He was so ridiculous yesterday

65
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:16,680
Doudou put a worm on Miaomiao's dress

66
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,279
Miaomiao is so freaked out and she cried

67
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,639
Yes

68
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,759
It's just kids' little prank 

69
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,512
I don't mind it if it's a low kindergarten, 1,000 yuan a month

70
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:36,725
But now why do we spend so much money for our kids?

71
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:41,560
We just hope our kids could grow up healthily and safely

72
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:42,839
Correct

73
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:45,120
We can't make a mistake in education

74
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,480
Yes...

75
00:05:52,075 --> 00:05:53,036
Yuwei's mom

76
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,639
We don't mind if you want to be a good person

77
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,720
Anyway, I will drive away Doudou

78
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,040
I want to give Miaomiao a safe and good environment

79
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,519
I sign first

80
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,160
Yuwei's mom

81
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:47,000
So you will sign or not?

82
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:48,839
I...

83
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:02,560
Sign it

84
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,839
All right

85
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:27,879
Well

86
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,519
My daughter Miaomiao's birthday is coming on the 20th

87
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:33,025
We are going to throw a big birthday party 

88
00:07:33,025 --> 00:07:35,025
for her at the Star Equestrian Club

89
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,199
You should come till then

90
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:36,680
Ok

91
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,759
Ok, I will go

92
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,439
My son William, likes riding horses best

93
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:42,279
Tell your son William to teach my daughter Linda

94
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:43,519
Ok, no problem

95
00:07:45,825 --> 00:07:50,079
My daughter wants to invite Yuwei

96
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:51,800
Yuwei's mom

97
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:56,025
You daughter will come, right?

98
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,079
Ok...

99
00:07:58,079 --> 00:07:58,920
Great

100
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,720
I like the cake

101
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,560
The cake is delicious

102
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:14,360
Yiming

103
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:17,110
Finally

104
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:19,439
I just finish my work

105
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,399
Come

106
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,240
I need to get changed first

107
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,560
Ok

108
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:35,639
Ok

109
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:36,720
President Pan, bye  -President Wang

110
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:39,799
See her off

111
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:43,600
Please

112
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:44,360
Goodbye

113
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:46,320
Goodbye, Siyu

114
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,679
Brother Yang

115
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,480
Siyu

116
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:02,840
Yiming, I love you

117
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,000
So great that he has you

118
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:18,919
I just arrived here

119
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,119
Brother Yang

120
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,840
I hope recently you can often play basketball with him

121
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:40,679
What's wrong?

122
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:44,000
He is gloomy recently

123
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:45,679
He often says he wants to be alone

124
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,240
Then he just stays at home alone

125
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,799
I am afraid if he goes on like this, he will become a decadent

126
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:55,200
He will get better when he finds a job

127
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,600
Yes

128
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,240
He needs to find a job as soon as possible

129
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:15,639
Brother Yang

130
00:11:18,075 --> 00:11:20,519
How's the tender?

131
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,360
Next week, we will make the announcement with the tender plan

132
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,960
I will notify you in advance

133
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:26,840
Ok

134
00:11:27,775 --> 00:11:29,480
I have filed it in our company

135
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:31,519
I'll bid on behalf of our company

136
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:34,519
Just ignore others

137
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,600
What do you mean? Who else?

138
00:11:37,675 --> 00:11:40,679
Now the competition in our company is fierce

139
00:11:43,075 --> 00:11:46,960
As I know, you are framed up

140
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,120
More than that

141
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,679
They nitpick me in every way possible

142
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,679
How do you face?

143
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,600
Nothing special

144
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:57,759
Just retaliate them back

145
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:13,275
Some people are just like mosquitoes

146
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,879
The more you hide, the more aggressive they get

147
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:17,799
Just swat them

148
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:19,320
Then the whole world is quiet

149
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,039
You are right

150
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,399
Come

151
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:46,320
I had to sign under that circumstance

152
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:50,200
But after that, I feel so bad

153
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,960
So be it

154
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,120
Yes

155
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,759
I can go to visit equestrian club

156
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:00,879
Great

157
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:06,200
Wu, I told you last time

158
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,919
He is getting more ridiculous

159
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:10,759
Originally, I wanted to make concessions

160
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,360
Now I have to fight back

161
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,840
How?

162
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,399
They hold the birthday party in equestrian club

163
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:25,840
What gift should I prepare?

164
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,240
A six-year-old girl's birthday

165
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,600
Why bother?

166
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:33,519
Your priority is to persuade mom

167
00:13:33,975 --> 00:13:36,120
Xiaoling today gave me an idea

168
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,439
Can you get down to business?

169
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,799
Yuwei's business is not business?

170
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:42,039
The second child is not a business?

171
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,440
Xiaoling gave me an idea

172
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,320
Just tell your mom

173
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,200
You have no fertility

174
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:53,700
Your mom won't tell us to have a son

175
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:56,960
No, are you kidding me?

176
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,080
If people know this, I will be so disgraced

177
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:01,279
Your mom keeps nagging

178
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,080
You don't feel it's annoying?

179
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,240
We need to solve it

180
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,320
But we can't solve it like this

181
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:06,120
What should we do?

182
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:08,320
It can't be my problem anyway

183
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,919
Birthday present

184
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,240
It can't be less than 500 yuan

185
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:20,200
Sleep

186
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:24,879
Come, Yuwei

187
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,840
Open your mouth, eat more

188
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,950
You need to grow tall like your dad

189
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:31,879
Yang

190
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:34,800
Yesterday I called aunt Liu

191
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,039
Which aunt Liu?

192
00:14:36,325 --> 00:14:39,279
On the east, Liu Erguai's wife

193
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,759
She hugged you when you were a baby

194
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:42,639
Oh

195
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:49,712
Aunt Liu says, it's all because Yuwei is not a good name

196
00:14:50,275 --> 00:14:52,320
Yuwei has the underlying meaning of water, it's not for her brother

197
00:14:52,775 --> 00:14:54,879
So you can't have a son

198
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,399
No, mom

199
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:14,440
Why do you believe this?

200
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:16,919
If you think so, my name means more water

201
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:18,279
So I have to change my name?

202
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:19,600
It has nothing to do with you

203
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,519
All because of Yuwei

204
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,879
She has to change her name

205
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:24,919
Dad, I won't change my name

206
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:25,879
You won't change

207
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:30,200
Why you don't believe me?

208
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:33,639
Yang

209
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,000
You are not like this before

210
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:40,039
Mom, I am full

211
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,480
What are you looking at?

212
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,360
Eat...

213
00:16:00,675 --> 00:16:02,720
We should get a medical certificate

214
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:08,279
You have changed your mind?

215
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,679
Yes I have changed my mind

216
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
But it's your infertility certification

217
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:17,200
Otherwise it's so disgraceful

218
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:22,840
Ok

219
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,120
Zhao

220
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:42,519
Mr. Liu

221
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:43,279
Sit down

222
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,840
I have checked your data

223
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,000
It's very informative

224
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,159
It saves me a lot of time

225
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:48,799
Thank you

226
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,840
I am busy recently

227
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:54,486
Please help me with this paper

228
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,200
Make it into a formal bidding paper

229
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:57,440
Ok

230
00:16:58,519 --> 00:16:59,279
Thank you

231
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:14,559
Come

232
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,400
That's it

233
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,839
I have told you I have many friends

234
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,559
I find this one according to your requirements

235
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:21,279
Come, shoe covers

236
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,359
Look

237
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,025
If you don't like it, we can find another one

238
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,359
Come, come in

239
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:43,880
Come

240
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:45,720
Have a look

241
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,559
This is the bathroom

242
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,440
This is the kitchen

243
00:18:00,475 --> 00:18:03,039
Now the one-bedroom house...

244
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:04,519
Look here

245
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,039
The environment

246
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:09,519
Very stylish

247
00:18:10,275 --> 00:18:12,440
It's very suitable for girls like you

248
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:15,759
I have seen many houses like this

249
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,480
My friend said, this is the best for my girlfriend

250
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,559
Future girlfriend

251
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,359
Look at the balcony

252
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,119
Here is the best

253
00:18:49,675 --> 00:18:51,839
Do you feel it's like old Shanghai?

254
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:54,839
The house is so old

255
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,960
The house is old

256
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,400
But it's newly decorated

257
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,200
The most important thing is location

258
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:02,200
This location is downtown

259
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:03,519
It's quiet in a bustling area

260
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:06,079
It's so close to the subway

261
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:07,039
Will it be noisy?

262
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:08,279
Listen

263
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,759
Do you hear the noise?

264
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,160
Do you know why?

265
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,125
The subway station is in north

266
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,400
We are in the south

267
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,200
But there is a snack street nearby

268
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,440
People come and go

269
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:27,480
No, that snack street is great

270
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,559
If you are hungry at night, you can eat downstairs

271
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:31,400
So convenient

272
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,039
Then I will get fat easily

273
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:33,960
You won't

274
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:35,039
I have thought about it for you

275
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,799
There are three gyms over there

276
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:39,839
You will have discount if you apply for a VIP card now

277
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,359
You are an intermediary or he is?

278
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:45,480
He is

279
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:47,799
Come...

280
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:49,640
Introduce here to her

281
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:51,759
Miss Gu, how's it?

282
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,759
Do you like it?

283
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,240
How much a month?

284
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,599
4,500 a month

285
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:01,691
One month deposit and two months up front

286
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:02,880
So expensive?

287
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,039
Not expensive

288
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:06,680
You are an intermediary or he is?

289
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:08,000
It's him

290
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,319
Shut up

291
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:16,279
My current apartment is 3,8000

292
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:20,079
You...

293
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:22,039
3,800, a deal

294
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:23,900
Really?

295
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,000
Then I will re-bargain, 3,500

296
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:27,119
No...

297
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:29,839
Look

298
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:31,720
We should be trustworthy, right?

299
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,640
You said, it's 3,800

300
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,240
You get some rebate, right?

301
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:37,079
Heaven forbid

302
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:39,200
How can I shortchange you?

303
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:40,480
Do I take the rebate?

304
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:43,519
Then why do you defend for him?

305
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,400
If you really don't believe me

306
00:20:46,775 --> 00:20:48,240
I can show you my heart

307
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:48,759
Look

308
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:50,359
Smelly, get away from me

309
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:53,359
Miss Gu

310
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:55,720
So can we sign the contract, now?

311
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,759
3,500

312
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:02,079
Can you make some compromise?

313
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,880
Show your sincerity

314
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:06,799
Deal

315
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,119
Can I move tomorrow?

316
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:10,400
I'll give you the key right after we sign the contract

317
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:10,759
Ok

318
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,319
Deal

319
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,440
So great that you like it

320
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,200
See around

321
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,039
Great

322
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:22,920
You cost me 500 yuan

323
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:24,359
Brother

324
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:26,039
Your girlfriend is so beautiful

325
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,440
Let alone 500

326
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:29,359
it's worth it even if it's 5,000

327
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,440
Go away...

328
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,519
Your bed  -Don't sit on my bed

329
00:21:36,519 --> 00:21:37,960
No... The bed

330
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,200
It's very comfortable to lie on it

331
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,519
You should lie down

332
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:42,920
Director, the new tender scenario

333
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,240
How's it?

334
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:48,160
No mistake this time, right?

335
00:21:49,325 --> 00:21:52,319
If you make another mistake, I can't explain to president Lu

336
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:57,839
Ok, just leave it here

337
00:21:58,799 --> 00:21:59,519
I will check it out

338
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:03,200
If there is no problem, I will give it to president Lu

339
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,319
There will be no problems

340
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:07,599
If we purchase according to this scenario

341
00:22:08,075 --> 00:22:11,920
we will waste 8,000,000 yuan

342
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:14,880
Liu Yang

343
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:16,559
What do you mean?

344
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:18,960
Director

345
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,319
The tender scenario in your hands is made by Zhao and Wu

346
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,039
I have another one here

347
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:29,601
This one, I checked and verified all the data

348
00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:38,279
The biggest difference is

349
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,825
several chapters in the first scenario are made by Zhao and Wu

350
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:47,039
Their budget plan will waste a lot of money

351
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:51,559
And the waste won't happen in the second scenario

352
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:12,160
Look at this

353
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,279
Come

354
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,599
Yes  -This...

355
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,240
Put this in the attachment

356
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:16,920
Ok

357
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,640
Have lunch together

358
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:38,599
For the celebration

359
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,160
Wu, Zhao

360
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,759
Director wants to see you

361
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,160
Braised pork

362
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:57,920
Thank you

363
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,240
Let me tell you

364
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:03,300
In my presence, director Wang didn't say anything

365
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,725
But then he transferred Wu to receive and send files

366
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,880
And transferred Zhao to be the receptionist

367
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,359
So great

368
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:17,000
Well, director Wang agreed

369
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,425
You are one of my team now for this tender project

370
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:21,839
Really?

371
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,400
So I can learn something from you

372
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:34,775
After the tender is completed, I will tell director Wang to hire you formally

373
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:37,559
Thank you, brother Yang

374
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,440
No, brother

375
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:44,680
I'm sorry

376
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,281
I don't know why I call you brother Yang

377
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:49,799
Whatever you like

378
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:56,599
If I call you brother Yang,

379
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,200
so what will you call me?

380
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:09,575
I will call you sister Yun in the future

381
00:25:10,359 --> 00:25:11,039
Ok

382
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:12,599
Come, sister Yun

383
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:17,079
Thank you

384
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:21,300
Without you, god knows what will happen

385
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:22,960
Brother Yang

386
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,599
Don't say like that

387
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:27,000
With your talent and ability

388
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,160
those villains can't touch your foundation

389
00:25:30,759 --> 00:25:32,440
But it's so annoying

390
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:34,559
Brother Yang

391
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,079
I'll follow you from now on

392
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,720
Is it true?

393
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,119
My uncle works there

394
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:50,599
They are making the tender scenario now

395
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,839
What's the total money?

396
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,839
More than 20 million

397
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:55,839
How about Li Siyu?

398
00:25:56,599 --> 00:25:57,920
We only lead them by 300,000

399
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,279
We got Daneng's order of 5,000,000, right?

400
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,240
We didn't sign the contract

401
00:26:04,075 --> 00:26:06,240
Sister Yuan negotiated with them for more than three months

402
00:26:07,675 --> 00:26:09,359
They found a new supplier

403
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,400
I don't know the specifics

404
00:26:12,075 --> 00:26:14,279
We need to take the project

405
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:19,175
Yes, sister Yuan will be the director after we get the tender

406
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,519
Go ask your uncle

407
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,079
who is in charge of tender

408
00:26:23,079 --> 00:26:26,375
I need to know his personal hobbies and social connections

409
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,640
Ok

410
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,079
Mr. Guo

411
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,880
It's so hard to make an appointment with you

412
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,960
I tried so hard to make an appointment with you

413
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:41,640
So we can't leave unless we drink up the wine

414
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:45,119
Mr. Guo

415
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:46,839
I have a stomach problem recently

416
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,200
I can't drink

417
00:26:48,759 --> 00:26:50,640
Drink one glass

418
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,599
I really didn't lie to you

419
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,720
Let me show you

420
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,279
See, all stomach medicine

421
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:58,319
Ok...

422
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,240
I will drink alone, ok?

423
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,920
Next time

424
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:04,250
Excuse me

425
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,359
Hello

426
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,519
I know

427
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,640
Keep an eye on that

428
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:17,799
Education, age

429
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,359
Not a problem

430
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:21,240
I just needs talents

431
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:24,960
Yes, ok

432
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,720
Thank you

433
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:28,680
Goodbye

434
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:32,720
Mr. Guo

435
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,519
Your company is recruiting people?

436
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,240
We need a director for publicity department 

437
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,480
I can recommend one for you

438
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:43,799
Great

439
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:45,720
Pass on

440
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:47,599
Yes, get in

441
00:27:48,279 --> 00:27:50,319
Ok, great

442
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:52,559
It's close

443
00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:55,319
So dangerous

444
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,680
Come, Yiming

445
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,319
Drink

446
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:03,440
No water, drink beer

447
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,759
I drive today, no beer

448
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:06,039
I will drink with you another day

449
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:06,599
Ok

450
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,000
Yiming

451
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,519
As I know, you are looking for a job recently

452
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,450
Fenglin company is recruiting a copywriter

453
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:21,160
Are you interested?

454
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:23,119
I can recommend you

455
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,039
Mind your language

456
00:28:26,125 --> 00:28:28,640
He was the planning director

457
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,200
You tell him to apply for copywriter

458
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,000
Are you insane?

459
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,839
Don't listen to Haowen

460
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,480
I just want to take a break recently

461
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,519
I don't think about the job now

462
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,359
Ok, I get it

463
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:42,960
Thank you

464
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,599
It's ok

465
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:45,559
Come, drink

466
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:46,599
Come...

467
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,319

468
00:28:51,025 --> 00:28:52,505

Come, drink

470
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,759
Bravo

471
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,359
Hurry, I am waiting

472
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:19,200

473
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,640
What post?

474
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:26,880
Mr. Guo

475
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:28,519
I have sent the resume to you

476
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:29,039
Ok

477
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,240
Yeah, I got it

478
00:29:32,575 --> 00:29:35,160
I willl transfer it to the HR director

479
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:39,680
Mr. Guo, thank you

480
00:29:40,599 --> 00:29:41,519
Let me propose a toast to you

481
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:49,119
You can't drink, right?

482
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:51,559
I am happy today

483
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:52,240
Ok

484
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:54,440
Sit down...

485
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:55,920
Come

486
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:02,039
Where are you now?

487
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:03,400
With whom?

488
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,279
Sister, look

489
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:11,475
We have cooperated with each other happily for so many years

490
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,759
All because you are so kind

491
00:30:22,925 --> 00:30:28,627
He wants to ask Mr. Chen Yiming to have an interview tomorrow

492
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:29,680
Sure

493
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:31,079
No problem, when tomorrow?

494
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,519
Ten o'clock in the morning

495
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,200
I tell him now

496
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,160
Mr. Guo

497
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:40,440
Thank you so much

498
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:42,359
To you again

499
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,680
No wine

500
00:30:47,275 --> 00:30:50,359
We can have another bottle

501
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,279
One more bottle

502
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:53,920
Waiter, wine

503
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,880
Haowen, I need to make a call now

504
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,720
Excuse me

505
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:12,480
Mr. Guo, I need to answer the call

506
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,079
Go

507
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:14,440
Waiter

508
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:25,920
Waiter

509
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,880
Bring me another bottle of wine

510
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,519
Ok

511
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:36,880
Hello, Siyu

512
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,920
Yiming, good news

513
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,200
10 o'clock tomorrow morning

514
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,160
You will have an interview at the company

515
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:42,519
I have sent the address 

516
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,000
You are drunk?

517
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:47,000
You told me, you won't drink today, right?

518
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,359
I have good news today

519
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,160
I just signed a contract

520
00:31:51,319 --> 00:31:53,000
Also helped you find a job

521
00:31:56,319 --> 00:31:57,279
Send me the location

522
00:31:57,799 --> 00:31:58,759
I am coming to pick you up now

523
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,240
Can it be cured?

524
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,640
Obstruction of fallopian tubes, it can't be cured

525
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,279
What if the doctor makes a mistake?

526
00:32:26,975 --> 00:32:29,359
It's the director of obstetrics and gynecology

527
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:30,119
It's true

528
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:34,680
I went with Zhizhi

529
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:36,200
The expert is famous

530
00:32:36,575 --> 00:32:38,720
We can't register if we don't have connection

531
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,480
Mom...

532
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:44,400
Are you all right?

533
00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:46,759
Let me process

534
00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:31,039
Mom

535
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:57,519
It works

536
00:33:59,559 --> 00:34:00,680
I am a little worried now

537
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:03,119
I am afraid my mom can't take the blow

538
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:04,480
Her disease will relapse

539
00:34:05,425 --> 00:34:07,640
She will be a little disappointed at most

540
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:11,375
We and Yuwei should talk to her more

541
00:34:12,518 --> 00:34:14,118
She will be ok, right?

542
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:19,119
Hope so

543
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,880
Let me help you

544
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,079
Let me help you

545
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,159
It's ok

546
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,119
Ok

547
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:26,559
The car is there

548
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:27,280
The car is here

549
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,119
Ok...

550
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:28,880
Let me help you

551
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,719
Let me help you

552
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,079
Be careful

553
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:32,920
Be careful

554
00:34:35,559 --> 00:34:37,519
Mr. Guo, to be honest

555
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,125
The interviewee tomorrow is my boyfriend

556
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:42,800
Really?

557
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,039
He is very excellent

558
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,559
Otherwise I won't love him

559
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:51,239
Yeah, it's true

560
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:52,079
Let me tell you

561
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:59,599
Your boyfriend is not an ordinary man

562
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,239
You will not regret if you hire him

563
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,920
Well

564
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:08,239
No need to have the interview

565
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:09,719
Just tell him

566
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:13,519
He just comes to work tomorrow

567
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,480
Really?

568
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:15,440
Yes

569
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:19,800
Mr. Guo, thank you so much

570
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:23,475
Thank you for giving me such a talent

571
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,575
Don't worry, I won't shortchange him

572
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,800
Thank you so much

573
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,159
Don't be so polite 

574
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,440
I won't

575
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,760
I'm afraid you drink too much

576
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,480
It's ok, girl, don't worry

577
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,519
I will keep an eye on him for you

578
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,400
Thank you, big brother

579
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,719
Ok, that's all, bye

580
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:45,280
Bye

581
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,159
Be careful

582
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:47,199
Go

583
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:09,880
Yiming

584
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,079
Why don't you come earlier?

585
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:16,000
You almost could see president Guo

586
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,400
What happened?

587
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,360
Smile

588
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:23,880
What happened?

589
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,760
Yiming

590
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:29,760
Yiming

591
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,519
Sir

592
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,760
A kiss

593
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,039
Honey water

594
00:36:58,599 --> 00:37:00,550
Drink some honey water

595
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:04,559
Nailed it

596
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:22,800
President Guo said

597
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,300
You will work directly without interview tomorrow

598
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,000
Director of publicity department

599
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:31,719
It's your profession

600
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:37,360
I won't go

601
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,719
Why?

602
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:46,480
Sit well

603
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,000
Yiming

604
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:04,280
You want to take some break and think

605
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,159
Ok, I support you

606
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,600
But you can't think endlessly

607
00:38:09,325 --> 00:38:11,599
You can't stay at home forever

608
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:13,199
You will be a decadent if you go on like this

609
00:38:13,775 --> 00:38:16,480
You need to go work

610
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,920
I have found a job

611
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,960
Found a job?

612
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:29,159
Which company?

613
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:30,960
Fenglin Industry

614
00:38:33,159 --> 00:38:33,840
Is the company big?

615
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:35,360
Just so so

616
00:38:36,519 --> 00:38:37,280
What do you do?

617
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,239
Copywriter

618
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:48,239
You are the director of publicity department in president Guo's company

619
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,239
His company is not big

620
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:52,480
But it's very stable in the industry

621
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:54,800
And last year, it's top Ten in China

622
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,400
Forget it

623
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,239
I will go to Fenglin

624
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,760
Why?

625
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,719
No why

626
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:17,960
Because they give you high salary

627
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,559
or you will have more opportunities in that company?

628
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,000
Neither

629
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,440
Yiming, I don't understand

630
00:39:29,775 --> 00:39:32,960
Normal people will choose president Guo's company

631
00:39:34,225 --> 00:39:35,426
I am an abnormal man

632
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,039
What happened?

633
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:41,880
Tell me the truth

634
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,550
I don't want you to suffer because of me

635
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,719
It's not a big deal

636
00:39:59,175 --> 00:40:02,239
I just drink some wine with president Guo

637
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:15,175
You won't be unhappy just because I drink with the client?

638
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,760
I won't

639
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,039
Then why?

640
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,700
Tomorrow you should go to president Guo's company

641
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:12,880
Ten o'clock in the morning

642
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:14,760
I have told you

643
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:15,840
I won't go

644
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,079
You...

645
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:19,079
Are you sober?

646
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,760
Go to bed early

647
00:43:09,719 --> 00:43:11,360
Why it becomes like this?

648
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:16,440
Why?
