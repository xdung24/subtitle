How about you take Yuwei

136
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,560
This happened

137
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,519
Not before

138
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,839
Maybe it didn't happen

139
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,199
Yuwei has no problems

140
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,160
She already

141
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,160
I peeed my pants three times a week

142
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,160
This is not normal

143
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,120
She may have just changed to a new environment

144
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,240
A little uncomfortable

145
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:45,079
She has been in the kindergarten for half a month

146
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,160
Not used to

147
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,279
This daughter is too squeamish, right?

148
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,680
Teacher, will it be

149
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,759
What did she eat

150
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,120
Something not to eat

151
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,160
How can this be

152
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:57,560
Children in the garden are the same

153
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,759
If you really eat and drink

154
00:07:58,759 --> 00:07:59,560
If there is any problem

155
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,759
Then other children have to have seizures

156
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,160
Why is your Liu Yuwei

157
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,839
Alone

158
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,199
mom

159
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:11,480
I want to go home

160
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:14,959
alright

161
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,319
It's almost time anyway

162
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,360
Today

163
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,720
You go back with your mother in advance

164
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:22,000
Thank you teacher, you bothered

165
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:31,040
Yu Wei

166
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,519
You never wet your pants before

167
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,000
What happened recently

168
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,639
Is it on purpose

169
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,200
Is not

170
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:43,799
why

171
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:46,879
mom

172
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:50,840
I want to go back to my original kindergarten

173
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,519
Is this kindergarten bad now?

174
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,279
This kindergarten is bad

175
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,159
why

176
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,080
Yuwei, don't be afraid, tell mom

177
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,840
Mom will protect you

178
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:14,639
The teacher scolded me

179
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:15,559
I am afraid

180
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,639
Then don't know what's going on

181
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:20,600
Just pee out

182
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,919
Why did the teacher scold you

183
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:26,399
The teacher said I eat slowly

184
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:27,879
Slow motion

185
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,720
Stop letting me eat

186
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:31,759
what

187
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:35,720
go

188
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,759
Mother Liu Yuwei

189
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:43,759
Are you to me

190
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:44,639
What's the misunderstanding

191
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,240
Liu Yuwei already

192
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,159
Told me all

193
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:48,480
There is no misunderstanding at all

194
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:49,960
Can you believe it all?

195
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,240
Is it hydrated?

196
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,639
Didn't you scold her

197
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:53,919
What am I scolding her for

198
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:54,759
She got into trouble

199
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:55,320
I as a teacher

200
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,759
Simply speaking two sentences won¡¯t work

201
00:09:56,759 --> 00:09:58,360
Then stop and stop eating

202
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,639
That's because of your Liu Yuwei

203
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:01,120
She is peeing in her pants

204
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,559
The kids are still eating

205
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:03,120
I just let her

206
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,080
Stand aside for a while

207
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,120
Is this wrong

208
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,759
Is there a teacher like you

209
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,759
Director, have a few words

210
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:09,559
Good good

211
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,679
About this matter

212
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:12,639
I already understand

213
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,159
How about this

214
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:16,519
Teacher Fang, go out first

215
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:17,679
Let me and

216
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:19,200
Talk to Liu Yuwei's mother

217
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:19,960
Go

218
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:27,320
Principal

219
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,240
I ask for Yuwei

220
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,480
Change a teacher

221
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:32,759
Can't change

222
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:34,320
why

223
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:36,320
Actually, Teacher Fang

224
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,639
It¡¯s just getting a little short-tempered

225
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:40,240
Everything else is pretty good

226
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,000
She has no love at all

227
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,440
Unqualified teacher

228
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,879
We have standards here

229
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,720
Director, this is my daughter

230
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,039
Is our family's baby

231
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,919
I'll pay her to come here

232
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:52,759
I hope she gets

233
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:53,919
Best care

234
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,879
I'm not disgusted by the teacher

235
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:01,759
Mother Liu Yuwei

236
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,759
How much did you pay

237
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:04,320
Just want the best care

238
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:04,919
that

239
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:08,960
I can't be scared by the teacher

240
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,559
So scared to pee your pants

241
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:11,440
The teacher is

242
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,759
Louder

243
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:14,679
Your baby

244
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:16,759
Mental retardation

245
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,519
I'm still peeing my pants

246
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:19,879
Who can you blame for this?

247
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,559
Director, what is your attitude?

248
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,320
I think

249
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,879
As a parent

250
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,720
the first

251
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,360
Don't be too glassy

252
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:30,840
Are ordinary people

253
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,879
Family child

254
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:33,320
Frustration education

255
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,879
This is all good

256
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:36,120
second

257
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,759
Don't have to make an inch

258
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,559
How much do you do

259
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:41,120
Everyone knows this truth

260
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:47,559
I want to report to the superior department

261
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:48,919
I want to expose you

262
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:50,360
It's up to you

263
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:52,559
Best to let everyone know

264
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:54,240
Kindergarten like us

265
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:56,159
Only more than 1,000 yuan a month

266
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:58,960
The children eat and drink here

267
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:01,360
Not touched or hurt

268
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,159
And the teacher took the game

269
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,200
Able to read and read

270
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,759
Kindergarten like this

271
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:08,039
Where to find

272
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,639
let's go

273
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:13,720
go

274
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,120
Mom, I have more tomorrow

275
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,639
Come to this kindergarten

276
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:33,519
Mom, I can't come

277
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,519
I'll stay with dad at home

278
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,879
I promise not to eat randomly

279
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:41,519
No noise, no peeing

280
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,960
Mom, why are you crying

281
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Mother guarantee

282
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:10,200
Not in the future

283
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,399
Let you be bullied again

284
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:12,799
Ok

285
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:18,600
Let's go

286
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,399
According to Mr. Li's proposal

287
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,440
Five hundred cities will be realized by the end of next year

288
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,480
Target of 8,000 service points

289
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:39,759
I pushed

290
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:41,639
Our monthly promotion fee

291
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,440
Should be at least

292
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,039
1.58 million

293
00:13:57,559 --> 00:13:58,720
I will give you this number at most

294
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,039
Then i can't do it

295
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,600
is it possible

296
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,200
Exchange resources with other websites

297
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:09,399
Then our number of users

298
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:10,919
Must be at least one million

299
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,120
People will talk to us about resources

300
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:14,720
When will it reach a million

301
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:16,639
As long as the promotion is in place, I¡¯m fine

302
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,879
I'm fine as long as the money is in place

303
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,159
As long as you earn money back

304
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,000
I'm fine

305
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,720
Whoever kicks the ball

306
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:29,840
If not considering promotion

307
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:31,559
Before the end of this year

308
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,960
Can you reach

309
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,159
One million users

310
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:35,080
Do not consider promotion

311
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,159
But service must be considered

312
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,440
Our current franchisees

313
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,480
And the service point is not up

314
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:39,799
Even if it is measured

315
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,120
Will also lose

316
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,399
Within two months

317
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,320
Won another two hundred franchisees

318
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:48,840
Mr. Li, kill me

319
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,480
Even if one is implemented a day

320
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,879
I can at most in these two months

321
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:52,960
Implement sixty me

322
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,519
Row

323
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:54,879
I'll run with one hundred and forty left

324
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:55,799
Manager Li

325
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:56,320
Sister Tian

326
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,039
You help me book the nearest class today

327
00:14:58,039 --> 00:14:59,279
Train ticket to Hefei

328
00:14:59,279 --> 00:14:59,759
Ok

329
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:01,440
Xiao Lu, last time you said

330
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,840
Someone in Hefei wants to be a regional agent

331
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:04,039
Give me his information

332
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:04,639
it is good

333
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:05,919
That's it. The meeting ends

334
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,840
Gosh

335
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:12,200
President Li is going to die

336
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:13,919
Sister Fan

337
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:14,840
Take it out

338
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,639
Isn't it enough?

339
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:16,840
No money

340
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,879
Don't our company still have money

341
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,399
You figured it out

342
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,279
I figured it out

343
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,240
What about me

344
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,720
Other aspects are good

345
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,639
It's a small heart

346
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:36,159
President Yuan

347
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:39,759
Sorry

348
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,960
I didn't do some things well before

349
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,080
I apologize to you

350
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:47,960
You can talk

351
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,759
Pretty smart

352
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:50,799
I am not smart

353
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:52,600
But i won't be lazy

354
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,639
OK, I accept

355
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,440
But be my subordinate

356
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,360
Stress will be great

357
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:02,919
Can also learn something

358
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,759
I still don't understand

359
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,039
Li Siyu is not

360
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:09,320
Have you opened a new company?

361
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:10,559
If you want to make money

362
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:11,720
Why not go find her

363
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,039
She just started

364
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,080
Also quite difficult

365
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:30,799
sister

366
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,279
Why are you here

367
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,360
See accompany you

368
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,240
Accompany you on a business trip

369
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:38,799
Who asked you to accompany me on a business trip

370
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:39,840
You put your hands on

371
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,559
So much work

372
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:41,519
I'm not doing business right here

373
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:42,799
Water in your head

374
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:43,960
Is not

375
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,840
Sister, don't be so irritable

376
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:49,639
Sorry, let me

377
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:50,480
Sorry

378
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,279
I help you

379
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,960
Sit sit sit sit sit

380
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:07,759
sister

381
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,079
First

382
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,319
Work on my hands

383
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,160
It's all done

384
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,039
second

385
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:13,519
I made this specifically

386
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:15,440
Jump to Hefei website

387
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,160
You take this to talk to people

388
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:18,960
Guaranteed to do more with less

389
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:24,200
When did you do

390
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,440
Just now

391
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,200
People want to design for me

392
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,079
Any doubts

393
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,359
I can answer on the spot

394
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:31,720
What's the problem

395
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,119
I can also modify it on the spot

396
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,880
Wait to finish Hefei

397
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,039
I want to go to Nantong

398
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:40,920
You ask Xiao Lu for information

399
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,279
Before the train arrives in Hefei

400
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:44,640
I want a page from Nantong

401
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,599
Obey

402
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,200
Hello how many people

403
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:54,960
Have reservations

404
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,000
Hello there

405
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:10,720
you are late

406
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,279
Five minutes and thirty two seconds

407
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,599
Sorry, traffic jam on the road

408
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:17,160
This time

409
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,240
The city center will definitely be blocked

410
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,759
So before you go out

411
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,000
Should at least be reserved

412
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,400
Fifteen minutes

413
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,799
I know

414
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:27,920
Waiter

415
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,960
Do you order food?

416
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,839
Steak set meal soda

417
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,519
Thank you

418
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:39,200
The same thanks

419
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:41,960
What drink does the lady drink

420
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,559
Ice latte

421
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:45,000
Unsweetened skimmed milk

422
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:46,400
You drink ice

423
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,400
what happened

424
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,720
Women drink ice easily

425
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,039
Bad for future births

426
00:18:53,319 --> 00:18:54,480
So hope you in the future

427
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:55,759
Don't drink ice

428
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,079
This is for you

429
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,480
Hello there

430
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,720
Change her to hot lemon tea

431
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:00,559
Thank you

432
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,680
it is good

433
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:15,240
This time you choose

434
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:16,599
Very interesting

435
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,759
Four forty four

436
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:21,799
By six twenty one

437
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:23,920
Is there any special meaning

438
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,200
I end the meeting at 4:30

439
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,000
Go downstairs and pick up the car for three minutes

440
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,680
From company to here

441
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:30,680
It takes nine minutes

442
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,160
Stop for two minutes

443
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:33,079
So ask you

444
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:34,279
Four forty four

445
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,200
It's six forty-five

446
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,680
I have a video conference

447
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:39,599
Although it is the evening rush hour

448
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:40,880
But it won't block

449
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,720
There are only three traffic lights

450
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,599
Back to the company from here

451
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,960
It takes twenty minutes

452
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:47,599
Park upstairs for three minutes

453
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:48,680
and so

454
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,319
At six twenty one

455
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:51,599
Our date is over

456
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,960
What are you doing

457
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,640
Weighing

458
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,640
My fitness coach

459
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,400
Made me a

460
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,240
Diet plan

461
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,599
My daily calorie intake

462
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,000
All have strict restrictions

463
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,880
Look at them

464
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,000
Don't mind the eyes of others

465
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,799
I don't mind

466
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:28,279
But did not expect

467
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:30,160
You are so strict with yourself

468
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:33,240
Self-management awareness

469
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,839
Is to measure the elite

470
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:36,440
Important standards with the grassroots

471
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:37,920
This management

472
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,240
Not just at work

473
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:41,240
Also includes self-size

474
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:42,240
Manners

475
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:43,839
And family run

476
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,759
Child education

477
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:50,319
Makes sense

478
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,400
I'll make one for you later

479
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:55,440
What to formulate

480
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,039
Self-management plan

481
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:19,960

482
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:21,240

Till three forty four

484
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,720
We can have lunch together

485
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,960
Then watch a movie

486
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,680
See you next week

487
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,599
Date at least once a week

488
00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:30,400
This is good for

489
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,440
We know each other

490
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,400
And enhance the relationship

491
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:34,400
next week

492
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:37,720
I'm not sure next week

493
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,720
Am i free

494
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,119
If there is no time

495
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,279
You can contact Miss Chang

496
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,480
She will help you arrange

497
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,599
Next date

498
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,119
Ok

499
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:47,240
See you next week

500
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:48,920

502
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:13,279
Fell asleep

503
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,119
Ok

504
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,960
I am trusting

505
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,960
Brother from my university

506
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:20,519
Help me contact work

507
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,279
Didn't the doctor let you rest?

508
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,799
What anxious

509
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,440
You stay here

510
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:29,839
Just be optimistic about Yuwei

511
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,759
I want to find a job earlier

512
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:35,319
So as to relieve your stress

513
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,599
I carry the pressure myself

514
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:09,920
Xiaoling

515
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:11,680
wait for me a while

516
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,400
Wait for me wait for me

517
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,079
wait for me

518
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,440
Lei Haowen, open the door

519
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,720
No one looks at you

520
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,759
Faster

521
00:24:24,119 --> 00:24:25,359
Here comes here comes

522
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,279
Why don't you even wear shoes

523
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,079
Come put on the slippers

524
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:36,880
Are there any band-aids?

525
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,680
Broken foot

526
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:38,839
Yes yes yes

527
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:49,799
Where is it broken

528
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:54,839
Let me see

529
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,160
Your feet are just right

530
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,599
Why wear high heels

531
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,960
Still so high

532
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:06,359
I have an appointment

533
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:07,680
Is it easy

534
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:10,279
Who did you date

535
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,480
Dated a bookworm

536
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,440
and then

537
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,279
I do not know either

538
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:21,480
Should there be then

539
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:24,559
All right

540
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,559
Do you have anything to eat here

541
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,640
In the kitchen, take it yourself

542
00:25:29,559 --> 00:25:31,000
I am too lazy to move

543
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:31,759
Pity me

544
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:32,640
Help me get it

545
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:34,079
Go quickly

546
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,480
Row

547
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:44,000
Why do you come every time

548
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,440
Don't say hello

549
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,920
In case I am Jinwu Cangjiao

550
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,920
How embarrassing it was

551
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:50,960
just you

552
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:53,240
impossible

553
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,400
Don't underestimate me

554
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,920
Someday if i really have

555
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,960
You can't cry

556
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:08,240
Who

557
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,880
My girlfriend

558
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:14,640
No, why are you going?

559
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,240
I let your girlfriend in

560
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,920
You stupid

561
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,039
We are a lone man and a widow

562
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:20,400
You grow so violently

563
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,160
Let her know

564
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,200
Don't worry about me

565
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:23,759
What do you say to me

566
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,640
You go into the house

567
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:28,519
Go in and hide

568
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:29,640
Not me still

569
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,519
You go in and hide

570
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:31,440
I'll take her away in a while

571
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:32,920
Leave you and come out

572
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:34,000
Remember, don't come out

573
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:35,599
I am still

574
00:26:35,799 --> 00:26:37,240
Don't come out, listen

575
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,240
I said you come out, you come out again

576
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,519
Sir hello your

How many times have I told you

579
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,039
I don't eat dinner at night

580
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,440
I lose weight, don't you know

581
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,440

582
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,759
Don't cry

583
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,319
Why cry

584
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,920
Don't contact me anymore

585
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,240
What's the call

586
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:18,720
Walk around

Gave me something delicious

592
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,799
I said i don't eat

593
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,839
Let me persuade me to go

594
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,680
Your girlfriend

595
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,240
Surname

596
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:57,799
Yes

597
00:27:58,759 --> 00:28:00,039
I still have a girlfriend

598
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:02,720
Hungry

599
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:04,640
Is the name?

600
00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:06,400
The two of them

601
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,799
Be jealous for me

602
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,119
It's a great fight

603
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:12,839
Then you

604
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,960
I have to treat them both well

605
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,240
this is mine

606
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:23,720
What happened to your noodles?

607
00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:26,079
You just finished the meeting

608
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:26,599
You follow me

609
00:28:26,599 --> 00:28:27,599
People who didn't eat dinner

610
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:29,160
Can you get by inside

611
00:28:30,039 --> 00:28:30,640
I

612
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:36,440
I tell you

613
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,519
I have my saliva here

614
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,400
so what

615
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,839
You are not afraid of my illness

616
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:47,119
What can you get sick

617
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,759
if serious

618
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:53,599
Might die

619
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,759
Then I will die in your saliva

620
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:58,640
Die well

621
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,799
Not worthy of mine

622
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,279
Affectionate

623
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:11,480
You said, they told me

624
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,519
So nutritious

625
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,799
I feel bored

626
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:16,079
You talk nonsense to me here

627
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:17,400
I feel very happy

628
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,799
Who am I

629
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,359
Because you are like me

630
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,880
The two of us

631
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,160
Are all domestic counterfeit goods

632
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:32,200
I labeled you a domestic second

633
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,240
Come here, hit you

634
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,359
Come, you hit

635
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:35,039
You come down

636
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:35,720
Hit hit hit

637
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,759
You give me you

638
00:29:36,759 --> 00:29:37,599
Come in the bedroom

639
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:38,319
Come come, you give me

640
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:38,839
Enter the bedroom

641
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,640
you come down

642
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:40,920
You come out

643
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,799
Lei Haowen, open the door for me

644
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:43,920
You have the ability to come out

645
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,240
Return my shoes to me

646
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:47,920
Qijue Group's list

647
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,799
Didn¡¯t you sign all the contracts?

648
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:49,640
Why lost again

649
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:53,359
President Yuan, I really don't blame me for this

650
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:54,559
Who is to blame

651
00:29:55,079 --> 00:29:55,960
You do not know

652
00:29:56,039 --> 00:29:56,720
Their group

653
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,920
The manager in charge of this project

654
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,880
How strange is your temper

655
00:29:59,079 --> 00:30:00,680
Every time i go to see him

656
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:02,400
Legs are shaking

657
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,799
I asked you about the contract

658
00:30:05,559 --> 00:30:07,480
Manager Su has too much appetite

659
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,319
I dare not agree

660
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:11,279
He turned back

661
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:12,039
How big is it

662
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,720
Definitely beyond our bottom line

663
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,079
Your performance this month

664
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:20,799
How to calculate

665
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,559
I

666
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:25,480
I confess

667
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,599
There is

668
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,480
Zhang Zhizhi is coming to our department

669
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:35,720
What is she doing

670
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:36,759
Sales

671
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,200
Can she do it

672
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:39,240
She won't

673
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,519
Is there any other purpose?

674
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,279
I asked human resources

675
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,480
Said it was difficult at home

676
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,640
Want to make some money with us

677
00:30:45,559 --> 00:30:46,880
She is too naive, right

678
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:48,160
She has today

679
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,799
When I scolded President Yuan,

680
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:50,559
How arrogant

681
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,559
President Yuan

682
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:53,519
Take advantage of this opportunity

683
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:54,599
Teach her a lesson

684
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:55,119
Let her know

685
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:56,440
What is regret?

686
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:01,240
I have an idea

687
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,759
We put here

688
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:03,920
Decorate more warmly

689
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,759
So the customer is coming

690
00:31:04,759 --> 00:31:05,759
Happy to look at

691
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:06,440
it is good

692
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,039
chopsticks

693
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,519
Put this green plant over there

694
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,519
Lean to that side

695
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:12,079
it is good

696
00:31:12,519 --> 00:31:13,400
Stay closer

697
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,720
President Yuan, I'm here to report

698
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:17,200
President Yuan

699
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:18,000
these files

700
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,200
What about this chair

701
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,000
Where to put it

702
00:31:23,559 --> 00:31:24,559
Vacate that room

703
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:25,279
When the utility room

704
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:26,480
Put it all inside

705
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:27,559
it is good

706
00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:28,279
Hurry up

707
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:30,319
Xiao Wu Bibo

708
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:31,440
Do a favor

709
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,240
President Yuan, I'm here to report

710
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,759
Move this over

711
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:36,039
Xiao Liu, push this shelf back

712
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,319
Yes come

713
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:40,839
Come on

714
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,039
Put this one more

715
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:44,759
Put some green plants

716
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:45,599
Put this put this put this

717
00:31:48,359 --> 00:31:48,920
Let me see

718
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:49,839
Put this here

719
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:51,160
Put this right right right right

720
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,160
Right these put here

721
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,839
Zhang Zhizhi, why stand silly?

722
00:31:54,839 --> 00:31:56,119
Find a place to sit down

723
00:31:56,319 --> 00:31:57,799
Waiting for others to serve you

724
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:16,680
No one in this seat

725
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,440
Sit here

726
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,079
Thank you

727
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:23,960
Why are you jumping here

728
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,319
Isn't this asking for trouble?

729
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:27,039
As long as there is still something to eat

730
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,599
Whether it is bitter or sweet

731
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,079
President Yuan will definitely not let you

732
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:31,920
Have a good life

733
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:34,079
Without her

734
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:35,759
My life is not easy

735
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:37,400
Zhang Zhizhi

736
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,359
Come here

737
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,480
You go visit this customer

738
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,799
I'm alone

739
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:50,599
Why let me match it for you

740
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,559
Assistant driver

741
00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:52,640
Babysitter, hair stylist

742
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:54,640
That was not what I meant

743
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,240
I'm afraid of messing up

744
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,759
After all i today

745
00:32:57,759 --> 00:32:58,960
When the first day of sale

746
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:00,880
Just because you are the first day

747
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,920
So give a

748
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,359
Good customer for you

749
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,279
As long as he signs

750
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,720
Your mission this month

751
00:33:07,079 --> 00:33:07,880
Even finished

752
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:09,720
Go

753
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:10,960
Thank you Mr. Yuan

754
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:13,440
Lin Ling

755
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:14,839
Put this in that room

756
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:15,559
Move away quickly

757
00:33:15,799 --> 00:33:16,400
chopsticks

758
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,279
You come with me to move

759
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:18,240
Take away

760
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:29,519
Advance

761
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,720
Is it Mr. Mei?

762
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:39,160
it's me

763
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:40,880
Mr. Mei, hello

764
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:42,720
I'm Li Siyu from the company

765
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,440
This is my colleague Guan Xiaotang

766
00:33:45,079 --> 00:33:46,079
What's up with me

767
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,359
We come today

768
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:48,319
Just want to talk

769
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:49,440
Regional agency

770
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:53,079
Cooperation

771
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,160
So what

772
00:33:58,359 --> 00:33:59,599
Sit first, don't stand

773
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:06,839
You are

00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:08,079
Call

775
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:09,159
Yes

776
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:18,880
Will this play?

777
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,199
Played before

778
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:24,159
Come a game

779
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:25,960
OK

780
00:34:36,518 --> 00:34:37,598
Rarely encountered now

781
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:39,000
The girl who can play the King of Fighters

782
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:40,199
Do you usually play anything else?

783
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,559
this one

784
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,480
This is good

785
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:44,280
this one

786
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,079
Then you should be pretty good

787
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:00,480
Hit hit

788
00:35:04,679 --> 00:35:05,360
Legs legs

789
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,280
With legs with legs

790
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:07,920
With legs

791
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:12,360
Your hand

792
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,320
But a bit raw

793
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,320
Haven't played for a long time

794
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:25,920
President Mei

795
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:27,599
If you can guarantee

796
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:28,679
Get two hundred points

797
00:35:29,079 --> 00:35:29,679
I can put

798
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:30,960
Hefei regional agent for you

799
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,920
I heard

800
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,440
You have some

801
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,840
Franchisee's operation

802
00:35:36,519 --> 00:35:37,239
Not like you at all

803
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:38,320
The promotion is so explosive

804
00:35:41,719 --> 00:35:43,679
That's because our customers

805
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,880
Haven't started loading

806
00:35:45,559 --> 00:35:46,480
But our trend

807
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,320
Still pretty good

808
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:49,039
trend

809
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,440
I don¡¯t think the trend is optimistic

810
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,280
Fuck him, beat him

811
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,559
You look

812
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,239
Boring

813
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,400
Stop playing

814
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:12,119
In front of a master like President Mei

815
00:36:12,199 --> 00:36:13,679
I was convinced to lose

816
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:14,440
on

817
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,599
At this level, I am convinced

818
00:36:21,159 --> 00:36:22,880
President Mei, this is us

819
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,960
Latest statistics

820
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:25,320
You know

821
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,159
We called

822
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:27,360
Still very stamina

823
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,679
I am

824
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,119
Least believe in

825
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:32,960
Statistics

826
00:36:38,039 --> 00:36:38,840
or

827
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:40,800
Two for you

828
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,800
come

829
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:54,360
I play this game

830
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:56,159
But never defeated

831
00:36:58,519 --> 00:37:00,000
I am called

832
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:02,440
Young and Beautiful Thanos

833
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:05,480
Young and beautiful

834
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,599
Okay

835
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,440
Then I'll come to learn

836
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,679
Your little Thanos style

837
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,519
Advance

838
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:32,599
Mr. Su, hello

839
00:37:32,599 --> 00:37:33,239
Ok

840
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,760
you are

841
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,519
I i am

842
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:39,400
Salesperson of Lvbao Group

843
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,039
Zhang Zhizhi

844
00:37:40,039 --> 00:37:41,519
Can you take you fifteen minutes

845
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:42,159
Can't

846
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,400
I want to introduce to you

847
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:48,519
Our company's latest products

848
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:49,239
I do not want to hear

849
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:51,960
but

850
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,119
Where's the salesperson from before

851
00:37:57,239 --> 00:37:59,840
My colleague has something with her today

852
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,440
So

853
00:38:02,039 --> 00:38:02,960
So we lead

854
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:03,840
Send me today

855
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,679
Send one today

856
00:38:04,679 --> 00:38:06,000
Come here if you can't even understand

857
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,639
right

858
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:07,719
Your Lvbao Group is really

859
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:10,159
More and less good

860
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:13,599
No i am today

861
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:14,440
What is it

862
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:15,039
Trouble you to go back

863
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:15,840
Tell your leader

864
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,760
We Qijue Technology

865
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,840
Won't use your Emerald Group

866
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,960
Any product

867
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,599
Since then

868
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:20,559
You and your colleagues

869
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:21,400
Self-esteem

870
00:38:21,559 --> 00:38:22,760
Stop harassing me

871
00:38:23,239 --> 00:38:23,880
Don't

872
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:46,159
President Su

873
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,320
This is our company

874
00:38:48,519 --> 00:38:49,800
Introduction of the latest products

875
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,519
If you are free

876
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:52,800
Please take a look

877
00:38:53,239 --> 00:38:54,239
If you need

878
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:55,280
You just call me

879
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,920
I just used my success

880
00:40:16,199 --> 00:40:17,800
I was attacked by you

881
00:40:18,519 --> 00:40:20,079
Don't be proud

882
00:40:38,039 --> 00:40:38,840
Who are you looking for

883
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,760
How did you come in

884
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:26,440
You are lucky

885
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:27,079
Ok

886
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:30,719
Change game

887
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,519
I don't believe it

888
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:35,840
You pick whatever

889
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,280
League club

890
00:42:41,679 --> 00:42:42,280
I can

891
00:42:44,719 --> 00:42:46,199
Go alone

892
00:42:52,599 --> 00:42:53,400
Don't stop me

893
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,119
Have a phone number?

894
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:01,719
You are also calling

895
00:43:02,599 --> 00:43:04,360
Not high, only five drills

896
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,719
Send me to pull you

897
00:43:10,599 --> 00:43:11,239
This one

898
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:22,599
You are love

899
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,559
Exactly under

900
00:43:29,679 --> 00:43:30,960
Isn't it

901
00:43:31,519 --> 00:43:32,039
Is not

902
00:43:33,239 --> 00:43:34,639
I am your diehard fan

903
00:43:34,639 --> 00:43:35,320
is it

904
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,360
All your game videos

905
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:37,239
I have seen it all

906
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,599
Hope this time

907
00:43:42,159 --> 00:43:43,079
Happy cooperation

908
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,159
happy

909
00:43:45,159 --> 00:43:45,960
Surely happy

910
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:47,119
Happy, happy, happy

911
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:49,480
I saw the living god

912
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:51,639
keep it up

913
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:54,880
I add you a friend

914
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:55,840
Good good good good

915
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:58,559
Take a look

916
00:44:00,159 --> 00:44:01,239
You look

917
00:44:05,039 --> 00:44:07,519
Guan Xiaotang, I love you

918
00:44:08,519 --> 00:44:11,039
Guan Xiaotang, I love you

919
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:14,800
Guan Xiaotang, I love you

920
00:44:16,199 --> 00:44:16,840
Don't regret this time

921
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:17,880
Bring me out

922
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:20,239
I ask you

923
00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:22,119
I asked you to let Mr. Mei

924
00:44:22,119 --> 00:44:23,119
Why don't you listen

925
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:25,440
Why should i let him

926
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:27,400
You want to do business

927
00:44:27,679 --> 00:44:29,360
You have to make people happy

928
00:44:30,159 --> 00:44:30,840
But ah

929
00:44:31,239 --> 00:44:32,039
I do things

930
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,039
I have to make myself happy first

931
00:44:36,159 --> 00:44:37,159
You never worry

932
00:44:37,159 --> 00:44:38,320
How others feel

933
00:44:41,719 --> 00:44:42,519
I worry about myself

934
00:44:42,519 --> 00:44:43,480
Can't worry too much

935
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:44,320
I worry about others

936
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:48,880
I will

937
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,199
I won't show you to customers anymore

938
00:44:51,679 --> 00:44:52,599
why

939
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,960
No, without me this time

940
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,760
You can't take Mr. Mei

941
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,480
You are a mistake

942
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,119
I speak with strength

943
00:45:00,679 --> 00:45:02,400
You don't know how to socialize

944
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:02,880
Is not

945
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,239
I'm just too lazy to be hypocritical, okay

946
00:45:08,159 --> 00:45:08,960
Moreover

947
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:11,599
Are you stupid for those customers

948
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:12,880
I can't see your routines

949
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:14,800
Rather than let people see it first

950
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:15,840
Might as well take the initiative

951
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:16,800
Slaughter

952
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:18,400
Beat them so subdued

953
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,159
This business

954
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,519
It's a matter of course

955
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,800
Where do you come from so much truth

956
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:27,599
In the genes

957
00:45:30,679 --> 00:45:31,559
But

958
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:33,360
Some customers still

959
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,519
Eat your set

960
00:45:35,039 --> 00:45:36,679
Most customers

961
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:39,320
So, sister

962
00:45:39,519 --> 00:45:40,920
Take me next time you go out

963
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,360
Our two swords go together

964
00:45:43,519 --> 00:45:45,079
Invincible
