00:01:25,499 --> 00:01:32,599
# Google translate version for your reference #

2
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:34,799
Then you can watch

3
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,120
I have these few models

4
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,239
This one compares

5
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:38,239
More European and American

6
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:39,439
Look at these

7
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:41,319
Then the following words

8
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:42,640
Just a little more modern

9
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,519
This is our company

10
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:44,879
Several recently designed

11
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:46,040
Mobile phone software mode

12
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,519
You can see for yourself

13
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,280
Like European and American style etc.

14
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:49,840
Both have

15
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:52,519
Actually the style of mobile phone software

16
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,760
Directly affect the user experience

17
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,879
Actually this is very popular now

18
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:58,439
flat design

19
00:01:58,439 --> 00:01:59,680
What about the flat design?

20
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,439
Looks very simple and generous

21
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:02,959
What about the following models

22
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:04,359
Is more modern

23
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,959
Including the back

24
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,359
A bit more archaic

25
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:08,439
You think you like it better

26
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:09,158
Which style

27
00:02:09,158 --> 00:02:10,598
OK, I almost understand

28
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:11,360
okay

29
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:20,280
During use

30
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,280
If you encounter any problems

31
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,800
You can also give us feedback in time

32
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,800
It depends on everyone

33
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,719
I'm sorry

34
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:28,919
Hey

35
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,919
Do you like European style modern style

36
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,879
Retro style or simple style

37
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:35,520
Simple style

38
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:36,919
understood

39
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,520
Why are you asking this suddenly

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,759
Keep secret

41
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:43,599
By the way, what are you doing now

42
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,360
Keep secret

43
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:51,680
Just keep it simple

44
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,520
Row

45
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,120
Simple style

46
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,159
Ah, concise style

47
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:55,120
You can take a look at these

48
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:55,800
it is good

49
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,159
Just order this set

50
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:00,719
it is good

51
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,159
Wedding photos

52
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,360
I ordered the love of Nice

53
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:07,000
Is the best package, look

54
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,520
I booked the hotel

55
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,319
Yuehua Hotel

56
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,800
look

57
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:12,639
Although it is far from the city

58
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:13,520
A little further

59
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,639
But its external environment

60
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:16,599
The internal environment is pretty good

61
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:18,599
Honeymoon

62
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:20,000
I choose Maldives

63
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:21,879
Look

64
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,520
This is a travel agency

65
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,400
Recommend some of our islands

66
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,240
What's the situation

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,759
I happen to be relatively empty recently

68
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:33,840
I want to take advantage of this time

69
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,759
Got our wedding

70
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:38,080
But i still have

71
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,560
More important things to do

72
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,479
What's the matter

73
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:42,840
Is it more important than marriage

74
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,960
I want to build one

75
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,919
Shared platform for battery rental

76
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:54,960
I want to do mobile new energy service

77
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:58,960
just now

78
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:01,240
This idea

79
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,680
I have been brewing for a long time

80
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:03,639
Now exactly

81
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:04,560
Best time to start

82
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:09,800
What do you think

83
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,199
China's electric bicycles today

84
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:13,800
Ownership

85
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,280
Has exceeded 300 million

86
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,280
Has exceeded 300 million

87
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:16,360
But the battery is charging

88
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,560
But it has always been a problem

89
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,480
And the platform I built

90
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,079
Users only need to download one

91
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:21,720
mobile apps

92
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,720
You can go anytime

93
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,160
Any service outlet

94
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,439
Make a lease replacement

95
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,560
That is similar to

96
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,759
The kind of shared power bank

97
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:31,199
Right

98
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:32,360
Yes

99
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,360
But that one is too pediatric

100
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,920
Are billed in milliamperes

101
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,800
My

102
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,480
Itâ€™s a kilowatt-hour

103
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,439
E-bike business

104
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:41,199
After spreading

105
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,519
I also want to make an electric car

106
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:44,079
Provide battery rental service

107
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:45,360
The one that moves is

108
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,680
The entire battery industry

109
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,000
Your advantage in doing this

110
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,680
what is it then

111
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:52,439
I'm in this line

112
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:53,680
Worked hard for seven or eight years

113
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,360
For the battery industry

114
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,959
It can be said to be very knowledgeable

115
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,319
But you don't understand the internet at all

116
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,839
I can study

117
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:02,000
I can hire professional people

118
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,040
Do professional things

119
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,879
then you

120
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,279
Profitable model

121
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:09,759
Have you considered it clearly

122
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,720
Profit mainly depends on

123
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,360
User's rent and deposit

124
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,439
In other cities

125
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,720
You can also charge an initial fee

126
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:18,120
And as long as the platform is built

127
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,480
I can get the investment

128
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:22,120
Those shared power banks

129
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:23,720
The angel wheel took tens of millions

130
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,519
What about the cost

131
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:27,240
I do the calculation

132
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,399
The initial phase

133
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:29,560
About four million

134
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,399
Which includes

135
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:31,680
Platform construction cost

136
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,240
Build one hundred physical service outlets

137
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,560
And the cost of buying batteries

138
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,839
I also contacted a few

139
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:36,839
Battery manufacturer

140
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:37,399
They are willing

141
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:38,639
Give me the best price

142
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,279
What about the cost of promotion

143
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:42,480
Also included

144
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:43,959
Not enough

145
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:47,079
As long as the platform is running

146
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,639
I can get the investment

147
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,839
Just get the investment

148
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:51,240
Follow-up costs are not a problem

149
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,120
Siyu

150
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,639
I listen to it now

151
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:57,360
I think

152
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,959
Do you think about it

153
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,040
A little too simple

154
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,639
No i know

155
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:05,000
It must be difficult

156
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,839
But i have to do

157
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,519
And do it soon

158
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,720
I think this

159
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,079
You still have to think twice

160
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,000
After thinking twice

161
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,639
It's likely to be preempted by others

162
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,079
We have nothing

163
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:26,879
Now this market

164
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:28,000
It does not lack opportunities

165
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,319
But but now

166
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,839
Now i hope

167
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,279
You should still stop

168
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,639
I can't stop

169
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,240
I want to regain lost ground

170
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:39,720
I think still

171
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,680
Let's get married first

172
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,160
Get married

173
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:50,160
But i have a condition

174
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:54,759
What condition

175
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,160
I need capital to start a business

176
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,800
Shall we sell the house

177
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,199
what

178
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,600
and

179
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:12,279
I need a chief operating officer

180
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:14,480
Yiming

181
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,639
You quit

182
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:17,560
We start a business together

183
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,480
Are you crazy you

184
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,600
What does this mean

185
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:27,079
Siyu

186
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:29,560
I think you should

187
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,319
Calm down

188
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:32,839
Yiming

189
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:38,879
I need your support

190
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:41,079
Siyu

191
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:43,800
I can't support you now

192
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:50,839
You don't support me

193
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:51,600
I won't get married

194
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:56,960
Are you at the company now

195
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,039
I want to talk to you again

196
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,720
The system architecture problem

197
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:05,360
OK, let me go

198
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,240
President Wang

199
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:25,960
Mr. Fang, please come in

200
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:28,639
Hello

201
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:29,360
Hello

202
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:30,200
Please sit down

203
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:38,960
Never had a chance before

204
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,679
Communicate with Mr. Fang

205
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:42,279
Hope today we can

206
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:43,080
Speak freely

207
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:44,200
Be honest with each other

208
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,440
Ok

209
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:46,919
President Fang

210
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,120
Before I decided to invest in Emerald

211
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:51,879
From entrepreneurship to the present

212
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:52,600
All reports

213
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,600
I researched it all

214
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,480
I found a problem

215
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,360
The fastest growing years for Green Treasure

216
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,720
It just so happens that Mr. Pan is only in charge of R&D

217
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:01,919
And you

218
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,519
Responsible for the overall work years

219
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:05,960
Mr. Wang, you praised

220
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,000
Green treasure can have today

221
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,759
Not an individual

222
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:10,039
The miracle of alone

223
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:11,000
But everyone

224
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,399
The result of working together

225
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,360
President Fang is quite humble

226
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:15,720
Tell the truth

227
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,679
Probably from last year

228
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,799
National policy has been adjusted again

229
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:22,159
This industry has entered a cold winter

230
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:23,919
I noticed that

231
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:26,440
Fang's strategy is to shrink

232
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,840
My style has always been more pragmatic

233
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:34,600
I agree very much

234
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:36,840
Didn't Buffett say

235
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:39,320
I am not trying to cross

236
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,600
Seven foot high railing

237
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,240
What i'm looking for is

238
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,200
I can cross

239
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:44,600
One foot high railing

240
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,240
President Fang, Pan Zhiyong told me

241
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,200
He has a plan

242
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,000
Said it was within two years

243
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,759
Three more Lvbao three production lines

244
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,440
Thanks to Tianyi Group

245
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,559
800 million invested

246
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,919
Let Pan's plan

247
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,399
No more rice-free cooking

248
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,639
I also want to ask you

249
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,759
Right now

250
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,600
Market environment

251
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,639
Need to expand production

252
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,759
Is this a bit risky?

253
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:15,519
this problem

254
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:16,759
I have communicated with Mr. Pan

255
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,879
he thinks

256
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,440
This is a good opportunity to overtake a corner

257
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,679
I have been capital for so many years

258
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:25,240
Successful overtaking

259
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,320
I haven't seen a few

260
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,279
Overturned

261
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,919
See a lot

262
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:47,440
I also want to ask Mr. Wang

263
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,159
Based on your experience

264
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,720
What is the safest thing to do on a curve

265
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,480
why

266
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,840
Must be on the curve

267
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,600
why

268
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,440
Not directly on the runway

269
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:03,320
aircraft runway

270
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:05,559
Do you mean

271
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:06,320
President Fang

272
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:08,320
If I remember correctly

273
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,759
Emerald's profit last year

274
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,919
Is it more than one billion

275
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:14,679
Last year's cash flow was too tight

276
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:16,279
Have you joined this year

277
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:17,480
We hope to be able

278
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,519
More than 200 million

279
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,960
Too little

280
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:22,799
We are in the industry

281
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:23,840
That performance

282
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,080
It's very good

283
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,519
If I do it for me

284
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:29,600
I can guarantee

285
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,919
within one year

286
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:31,879
The valuation of Emerald

287
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:33,679
From 3.5 billion to 20 billion

288
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,039
20 billion

289
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:39,279
That net profit

290
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:40,559
To add more than one billion

291
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,840
Calculate backwards

292
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,960
At least ten production lines

293
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:45,960
Not needed

294
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,639
No need to expand capacity

295
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:50,279
Just need to repack

296
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:53,919
President Fang, you worked so hard

297
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:55,200
Make profit make market value

298
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,000
Isn't it for company valuation?

299
00:13:57,559 --> 00:13:58,600
Then why not directly

300
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,519
Work hard on company valuation

301
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,799
If Emeraldâ€™s valuation

302
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:07,960
20 billion

303
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,639
The 800 million you invested today

304
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,799
But it becomes four billion

305
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:15,759
Fang Zong and other executives

306
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:16,720
Hard work

307
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:18,600
There will be great returns

308
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,159
The production line of Emerald III

309
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:25,639
Still on

310
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,399
Money should be spent on the blade

311
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:32,879
Pan Zhiyong won't agree

312
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,840
What he decided to do

313
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,039
No one can change

314
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:39,600
Not always

315
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,080
He didn't want to make Li Siyu

316
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:44,639
Are you the sales director?

317
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:47,200
Isn't it impossible?

318
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,559
Green treasure is our green treasure

319
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,720
Not someone's emerald

320
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,360
To our green treasure

321
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,320
Sister Yuan is back

322
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:47,720
Sister Yuan

323
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:48,840
You are finally back

324
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,960
Sister Yuan, you are back

325
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,519
long time no see

326
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:51,320
You haven't changed at all

327
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,559
Sister Yuan wants to kill us

328
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:54,360
Sister Yuan, I knew

329
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,360
You will be back

330
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:55,840
Ok

331
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,679
Sister Yuan, you look so good today

332
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:00,120
Sister Yuan, your office

333
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,279
All cleaned up for you

334
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,159
Come take a look

335
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:16,159
smell good

336
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:18,799
Sister Yuan, I'm looking forward to you back

337
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,240
We all miss you

338
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:20,960
Just

339
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:21,519
Sister Yuan

340
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,080
how

341
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:23,519
Is Li Siyu

342
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,600
Suppress you

343
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,679
Yes

344
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,120
Sister Yuan, don't you know

345
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,320
You can't talk nonsense about this

346
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:29,759
Sister Siyu, for you

347
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:30,879
Three trips to Changsha

348
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,200
Final commission and commission

349
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,240
It's all to you

350
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:34,639
Why she did that

351
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:36,039
she says

352
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,039
You helped her like that back then

353
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:40,440
She is behind

354
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,799
You must have said bad things about me

355
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,320
Really not

356
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:45,159
She always says it's a pity

357
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:46,720
I ended up making trouble with you

358
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,480
Hope to have a chance to reconcile with you

359
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:51,240
Sister Yuan, tell the truth

360
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,279
Li Siyu

361
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:53,240
Very atmospheric

362
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,360
Comparable to you

363
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:56,200
No no no

364
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,240
Still a bit worse than you

365
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:04,880
Mr. Yuanhao

366
00:17:11,118 --> 00:17:11,758
Advance

367
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:16,559
Hello brother

368
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:20,960
This time

369
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,160
Declining sales

370
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:24,480
Need you to turn the tide

371
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,160
understand

372
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:27,079
In addition

373
00:17:27,598 --> 00:17:28,799
Who should the sales department open

374
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,119
Give me the list as soon as possible

375
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:32,200
Sales

376
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:33,599
Why open a man

377
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:37,039
Li Siyu's men

378
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:38,279
You keep them

379
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:39,599
I'll add a stumbling block to you

380
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:43,720
The people I left behind when I left

381
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,920
Li Siyu didn't open any of them

382
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,400
Now I come back

383
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,680
The one she left behind opened

384
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,000
That doesn't appear

385
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,359
Is my temperament not as good as her

386
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,240
You are going to keep them all

387
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,039
I took a look

388
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,680
Those few people are very good at fighting

389
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,279
I don't just want to stay

390
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:02,119
Still want to reuse

391
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,599
and also

392
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:05,319
Li Siyu later introduced some

393
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:06,279
Sales rebate policy

394
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:07,279
Also very practical

395
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:08,480
I also want to continue to use

396
00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:13,160
You lost to her

397
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,680
Because your heart is too soft

398
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:21,599
You always think my heart is too soft

399
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:23,000
Caused today's situation

400
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,599
Think in reverse

401
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:26,799
If my heart is softer

402
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,759
Could it be another result

403
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,559
boss Zhang

404
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,279
You only need to invest four million

405
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,559
The project can start

406
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,559
Three million is fine

407
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,680
Two million

408
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,720
I promise you that

409
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:45,319
As long as the number of users goes up

410
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:46,720
Cash flow is not a problem

411
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,920
OK, contact again

412
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,759
Hello lady

413
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,519
When can i serve

414
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:05,640
Wait a moment

415
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,359
OK

416
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,039
Hello, the user you are calling

417
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:25,519
Temporarily unavailable

418
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,240
Sorry

419
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:34,400
Hello, the user you are calling

420
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,880
Temporarily unavailable

421
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,160
Sorry for the user you called

422
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,200
Siyu sister

423
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,319
I'm sorry, the meeting is over

424
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:49,400
It's all right, sit down

425
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,599
Why are you alone

426
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,599
How many of them

427
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:54,720
Mr. Yuan said that the meeting was late today

428
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,640
Please have a meal

429
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:57,759
Xiaojia, Xiaotian and the others

430
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,359
Also eat Mr. Yuan's rice

431
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:03,000
Mr. Yuan still respects them

432
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,319
Siyu, don't be angry

433
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,160
What's so angry about this

434
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:09,839
I brought them out

435
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:11,119
Can be valued by the new leader

436
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:12,400
I should be happy

437
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:13,680
Why didn't you go

438
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,839
I think you come to me

439
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,200
There must be something very important

440
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:18,599
No matter what

441
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:19,839
Come to you first

442
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:23,480
President Yuan didn't embarrass you, right

443
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,599
Everyone said

444
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,960
President Yuan has changed a little this time

445
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,440
Where has changed

446
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:31,920
I can't tell

447
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,680
It feels much more peaceful than before

448
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,640
Siyu sister

449
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,480
Actually everyone misses you

450
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:42,279
One day Xiaojia said

451
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,960
Maybe Mr. Yuan will leave someday

452
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:45,680
You're back to be the director

453
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,039
Director

454
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,480
I can't look down on it now

455
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:49,759
I want to be

456
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:50,680
At least

457
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,039
General Manager Chairman

458
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:54,400
Siyu sister, you can definitely do

459
00:20:54,599 --> 00:20:56,319
Okay, stop talking

460
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,440
Lin Ling, I plan to start my own business

461
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,400
Project is particularly good

462
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,279
After five years of running

463
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:02,160
Go to market

464
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:04,039
I now officially invite you to join

465
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:09,519
Then I have to resign from Lubao

466
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,880
Of course

467
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:13,119
Project start-up stage

468
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:14,480
We have to invest 24 hours

469
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:16,160
but

470
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,000
You believe me

471
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,079
Everything I like

472
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:19,000
Nothing impossible

473
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:21,200
I have repeatedly demonstrated this project

474
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:21,920
Will only succeed

475
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,039
Never fail

476
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:28,680
This is my business plan

477
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,720
You will understand

478
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:37,440
Siyu sister

479
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:38,759
Sorry

480
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:41,640
I just got familiar with battery sales

481
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:44,079
You know my dad's situation

482
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:45,240
I think

483
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:47,799
I'd better be steady

484
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:54,920
This is a golden opportunity

485
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:55,960
but I

486
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,720
I may not be suitable

487
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:02,359
Did not you say

488
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:03,720
Have you set me up in this life?

489
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,039
I mean

490
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:09,039
I'll follow you as long as I'm in Emerald

491
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,319
I understand

492
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:35,160
Siyu sister

493
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,920
I promised Mr. Yuan

494
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:38,599
Finish things late

495
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:40,200
I still have to go to her

496
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,599
If you have nothing else here

497
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:45,960
I'll go first

498
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:50,359
You go

499
00:25:52,039 --> 00:25:53,319
Come, let's come

500
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:55,680
Come

501
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:48,200
Ok

502
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,200
Yes, but I only paid a deposit

503
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:03,319
Theme clothing or something

504
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:04,160
Wait for you

505
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,440
I can ask for leave this afternoon

506
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:35,799
it is good

507
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:17,440
I think today

508
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,720
Discharged

509
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,200
The doctor said

510
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:23,079
There are several indicators

511
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,279
Did not come down

512
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,480
Buy some medicine and take it home

513
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,720
I have already paid the operation fee

514
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,640
You don't care about me

515
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:47,440
I still have to work

516
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,799
Put the rice here for you

517
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:51,720
eat by yourself

518
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:03,799
You slow down

519
00:29:03,799 --> 00:29:04,400
Thank you

520
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,720
I met Lin Ling at the company

521
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:21,079
She said you want to start a business

522
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,160
Yes

523
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,000
What item

524
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,559
Item is called

525
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,559
Is an

526
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,279
Shared battery rental platform

527
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:34,039
New ideas

528
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,359
Where is it

529
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:39,640
I already plan to give up

530
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:41,640
why

531
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,160
Heard my idea

532
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,319
Everyone said yes

533
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:48,279
but

534
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,079
Unable to invest

535
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,440
No one wants to join

536
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,759
How much does it cost to start up

537
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:56,920
four million

538
00:29:57,119 --> 00:29:58,039
How much did you raise

539
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:01,359
If you add the money for selling the house

540
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,000
About one million

541
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:04,599
Green treasure invests 3 million

542
00:30:06,759 --> 00:30:07,559
Mr. Pan

543
00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:13,880
This is my project plan

544
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:15,279
Ok

545
00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:17,119
Very good, no need to read

546
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:18,880
I only look at people

547
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,279
Mr. Pan, I use tea instead of wine

548
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:24,440
do not worry

549
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,839
I will live up to you

550
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:26,359
Ok

551
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,240
I want to see results in half a year

552
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,240
for sure

553
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,640
Mr. Pan

554
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,119
How about emerald now

555
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,240
not good

556
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,440
why

557
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,640
I am going to take two

558
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,839
Emerald III's production line

559
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:50,400
Wang Ziru and Fang Zhan

560
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,079
Vetoed

561
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:55,359
They two join hands

562
00:30:56,359 --> 00:30:57,400
I suspect now

563
00:30:58,119 --> 00:30:58,920
She was

564
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,119
Vote for Yuan Huizhong

565
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:03,480
It's a certificate dedicated to Fang Zhan

566
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,000
I asked Sister Ziru about this

567
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,119
Why she voted so

568
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,119
Because of Chen Yiming's request

569
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:14,720
Chen Yiming

570
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:16,480
He doesn't want me to go out and work hard

571
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:18,400
He wants me to go home

572
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:19,920
Li Siyu

573
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:22,039
Do you believe

574
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,200
it is true

575
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:25,240
For this

576
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,279
Chen Yiming and I got into trouble

577
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:27,039
Almost broke up

578
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,599
Wang Ziru this woman

579
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,319
For a request from a subordinate

580
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,400
Involved again

581
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,880
With so many benefits

582
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,920
Finally for the sake of subordinates

583
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,759
I do not believe

584
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,039
What do you think

585
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:46,759
I think her vote

586
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:49,240
Must be well thought out

587
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,079
Besides now

588
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,720
She and Fang Zhan are in such a tacit understanding

589
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:55,960
Must be with that vote

590
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,119
Closely related

591
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,200
No way

592
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,240
I should hold

593
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,559
That 22%

594
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:16,440
I don't quite understand

595
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,240
You don't need to understand

596
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:22,079
Just do this well

597
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:24,359
I can handle the company

598
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,119
Xiaohan, this is Li Siyu

599
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,200
I wanted to be in your park before

600
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,279
Starting a company

601
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:38,359
Paused later

602
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,960
Now i plan to restart

603
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,400
No problem, Mr. Li

604
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:42,519
Can you

605
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:43,599
Apply now

606
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,359
just now

607
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,960
Today is our park

608
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,160
The last day of the promotion

609
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:48,759
If you apply again today

610
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,240
What was the previous rent discount?

611
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:51,839
Just can't enjoy it

612
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,079
I'll come over now

613
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:13,319
Hello, Siyu

614
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,440
Where are you now

615
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:15,759
I'm almost there

616
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:17,519
Yiming, sorry

617
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,480
Suddenly something happened to me

618
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,559
Otherwise, let's cancel today

619
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,519
What's the matter

620
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:24,759
I'm going to the park

621
00:33:24,759 --> 00:33:26,359
Submit an application to start a company

622
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,680
You haven't given up

623
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,720
What about your business plan

624
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:36,720
The situation has changed a bit

625
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,640
I think

626
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,599
You come right now

627
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:41,799
Let's order the wedding photos first

628
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,160
Yiming

629
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,839
Can we take it off today

630
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:51,960
Can't

631
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:55,759
I really can't walk away here

632
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:56,680
Siyu

633
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,880
I'm here now

634
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,839
The entrance of the bridal shop

635
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,359
I wait for you

636
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:55,199
Manager Li

637
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,239
This is our project introduction

638
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,159
Take a look

639
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,119
Now every year

640
00:34:58,119 --> 00:34:59,320
5% tax reduction

641
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,599
This is ours

642
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:04,559
Hello, this is the information you want

643
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:05,159
thanks, thanks

644
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:05,719
You're welcome

645
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,079
Manager Li

646
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:10,039
This is our preferential policy

647
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,760
Positioning of investment purposes

648
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,840
Regional Advantage Product Support

649
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,400
Thank you so much today

650
00:35:54,039 --> 00:35:54,880
You're Mr. Li

651
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,639
We should

652
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,639
Then, Mr. Li, I won't send you off

653
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:00,760
thank you

654
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,400
Goodbye

655
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,079
Goodbye

656
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:15,440
Hello

657
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,159
How can I help you

658
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,559
Mr. Chen

659
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:18,719
My boyfriend

660
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,039
Made an appointment to try in the afternoon

661
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,920
He seems to have just left

662
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,159
thank you

663
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:24,880
It's ok

664
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:08,320
Hey

665
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,400
Hello, Mr. Chen

666
00:38:10,519 --> 00:38:11,960
Miss Li's phone is always busy

667
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,119
I can only call you

668
00:38:14,199 --> 00:38:14,920
what happened

669
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,199
Your house

670
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:18,360
I took a look

671
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:19,559
What now

672
00:38:19,559 --> 00:38:21,119
Can sell for 5.2 million

673
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,159
But transaction tax suffers a bit

674
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:26,719
Who told you

675
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:27,679
We are going to sell the house

676
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:29,719
Miss Li told me

677
00:38:29,719 --> 00:38:30,679
She asked me to help her settle the accounts

678
00:39:27,159 --> 00:39:27,880
Hey

679
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,639
Where are you now

680
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,800
Project architecture and system architecture

681
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,920
Already formed

682
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:35,559
What i need now is

683
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,519
I'll call you later

684
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,920
You are going to sell the house

685
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:50,239
Yes

686
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,599
Li Siyu

687
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:58,519
Are you really crazy about you

688
00:39:59,159 --> 00:40:00,440
I'm not crazy

689
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,559
This is the argument I asked experts to do

690
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,960
The expert's conclusion is

691
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,639
This project is perfectly solved

692
00:40:09,639 --> 00:40:10,920
Pain points for battery owners

693
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:11,639
And any kind

694
00:40:11,639 --> 00:40:12,480
Business model success

695
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,039
definitely is

696
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:14,920
Efficient solution to market pain points

697
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,519
Can i now

698
00:40:16,519 --> 00:40:17,440
Don't listen to you

699
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,760
Why don't you listen

700
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,280
This is the evaluation of industry leaders

701
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,280
They all said that this project is

702
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,400
New energy and Internet

703
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,039
Joint innovation

704
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:27,159
Is leading the people to travel

705
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:27,880
Another revolution

706
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,559
enough

707
00:40:31,719 --> 00:40:32,480
Is enough

708
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:33,920
President Pan decided

709
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,000
Invest me three million

710
00:40:35,239 --> 00:40:36,639
Plus more than 1 million sold

711
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:38,159
The start-up funds are all resolved

712
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,199
Mr. Pan

713
00:40:42,679 --> 00:40:43,400
Li Siyu

714
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:44,519
I see you already

715
00:40:44,519 --> 00:40:45,760
Is he completely brainwashed?

716
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,480
three million

717
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:49,000
This is not brainwashing

718
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,159
This is called recognition

719
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:56,000
You can let go

720
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,079
I have nothing now

721
00:40:58,079 --> 00:40:59,239
I have got three million

722
00:40:59,239 --> 00:41:00,400
What reason do i have to let go

723
00:41:00,679 --> 00:41:01,320
Because of you now

724
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,239
Has lost his mind

725
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:03,239
Lost judgment

726
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:04,880
Chen Yiming

727
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,599
Everyone said

728
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:07,360
This is a rare occasion

729
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,199
Entrepreneurial opportunities

730
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:09,480
You said I lost my judgment

731
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,119
Everyone says this is a good time

732
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,719
You say i lose my mind

733
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:19,639
There are too many good projects

734
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,960
You have to see if it suits

735
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:25,679
Yes yes need need time

736
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,480
But you have to watch

737
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,599
Do you have the conditions

738
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,559
Conditions can be created

739
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,159
But the time waits for no one

740
00:41:31,639 --> 00:41:32,960
Then you can't do anything wrong

741
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:40,519
Then what do you think is nonsense

742
00:41:41,519 --> 00:41:43,559
For example

743
00:41:43,559 --> 00:41:44,519
Such as getting married?

744
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,639
Chen Yiming

745
00:41:50,519 --> 00:41:51,920
I'll tell you again

746
00:41:53,559 --> 00:41:55,079
I'm over 30

747
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:56,199
Still nothing

748
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,079
And you know

749
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:00,760
I just got caught

750
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,719
Defeated

751
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:02,920
I can't give up

752
00:42:05,679 --> 00:42:06,400
it is good

753
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:09,119
Then do as you said

754
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:11,960
Do you still want to marry me

755
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,960
Why don't you understand me

756
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:16,559
I want to counterattack

757
00:42:16,559 --> 00:42:17,239
I want to win back

758
00:42:17,239 --> 00:42:18,519
I want to fight for this tone

759
00:42:18,519 --> 00:42:19,400
I will ask you now

760
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,559
Do you still want to marry me

761
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:25,000
I would rather not get married

762
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,079
I want to continue

763
00:42:27,159 --> 00:42:28,000
If that is the case

764
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,159
Then we can only break up

765
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:44,480
Siyu

766
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:48,960
Siyu

767
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:50,760
That was not what I meant

768
00:42:51,039 --> 00:42:51,719
I agree

769
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:01,320
let's break up
