[Episode 5]

4
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,900
Hello, Sister Siyu.

5
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,800
Sister Siyu!

6
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,600
Thank you for taking me in.

7
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,000
But I think... it's better for me to leave.

8
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,600
- Why? 
 - I heard from Xiaojia,

9
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,600
that because of me, you were scolded by GM Pan.

10
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,460
You can leave,

11
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:22,100
but that means I got scolded for nothing then.

12
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,600
I got scolded in exchange for another chance for you.

13
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,500
GM Pan said that as long as you can sign a new client within a week,

14
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,300
you will be in the clear immediately.

15
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:35,800
A week? I can't.

16
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,600
Lin Ling, I believe in you.

17
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,800
If I say you can, then you definitely can.

18
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,700
I definitely can.

19
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:05,490
Among the customers you've met before, which one is most likely to sign?

20
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,000
Youyou Rabbit.

21
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,700
Why didn't he sign in the end?

22
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,000
Their company suddenly stopped production and switched models.

23
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,800
The new production line will be put into operation after half a year.

24
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,600
They won't need batteries until then.

25
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,600
So you just gave up?

26
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,200
I asked Sister Yuan about this. Sister Yuan said to just to keep in touch with them.

27
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,400
We will talk about it again in half a year.

28
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,300
- Let's go. 
 - Where to?

29
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,800
- To visit Youyou Rabbit. 
 - There are still five months left.

30
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,200
You have to go out there in order to know where the opportunity lies.

31
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,400
Opportunities never come to those who wait. You must fight for opportunities.

32
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,200
- Siyu. 
 - Sister Yuan.

33
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,200
I want to talk to you.

34
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,200
- Then you go back and wait for me. 
 - Okay.

35
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,700
Close the door.

36
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,200
Next time you take someone in, can you tell me in advance?

37
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,000
Don't rehire someone I fired.

38
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,700
To others, it might seem like there's a problem between us.

39
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,700
You didn't tell me in advance when you took

40
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,110
elites like Huang Bibo, Kuai Zi and A'Fu into your team.

41
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,000
Are you still upset about that?

42
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,400
I didn’t think it through well enough and didn’t tell you in advance.

43
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,800
I apologize to you.

44
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,600
No need, it's in the past already.

45
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:51,000
All right. I will treat you to dinner and you can pick the place.

46
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,400
I'll pick an expensive one then.

47
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,100
Sure.

48
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,600
Fire Lin Ling.

49
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,600
Why?

50
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,300
She's not saleperson material.

51
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,000
Why are you wasting your time on her?

52
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,700
I think she has potential doing sales.

53
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,400
Are you not going to listen to even my advice now?

54
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,000
It's not that I'm not listening.

55
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,400
I just promised to help her to sign a contract within a week so that she won't be fired.

56
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,700
- That's even worse. 
 - Why?

57
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,500
Siyu, I'll be honest.

58
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,810
I guided her for three months yet she had no breakthrough.

59
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:37,000
If you help her sign a contract within a week, aren't you giving me a slap in the face?

60
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,400
Sister Yuan, I'm not sure if Lin Ling can get a deal.

61
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,300
Even if she gets one, it's because of the foundation you helped her establish.

62
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,300
Others won't think like that.

63
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,000
As long as the two of us have no ill feelings, then what others think has nothing to do with us.

64
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,900
Saying that is easy!  But right now, the both of us are leading teams.

65
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,300
How can we not care about other people's thoughts?

66
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:12,500
Sister Yuan, Lin Ling's father is seriously ill.

67
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,700
She needs this job.

68
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:19,000
If you really want to help her, there are a ton of ways to do that.

69
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,400
Why must you use a method that would embarrass me?

70
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,600
It is better to teach people how to fish than to just give them fish.

71
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,000
She already has a foundation. It's a pity if she gives up now.

72
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,500
For a Lin Ling, you are harming our relationship.

73
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,100
Don't you feel pity?

74
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,500
Sister Yuan, aren't you overthinking?

75
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,900
Siyu,

76
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,100
don't forget.

77
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:56,500
You promised to just run alongside me.

78
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,800
A mere Lin Ling shouldn't have much impact, right?

79
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,700
Today it is Lin Ling, tomorrow and the day after, it will be some other people.

80
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,800
Sister Yuan, I already promised you.

81
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,000
But you still don't believe me and always keep a wall up towards me. Is there any point in that?

82
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,900
Li Siyu, ask your conscience.

83
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,700
Will you be where you are today without me?

84
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:26,400
Right now, I'm just asking for a small favor but you say one thing and do another. How should I think of you?

85
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,100
- When did I say one thing and do another? 
 - Then fire her now.

86
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,200
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

87
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,800
Is this Dayu Investment Company?

88
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,500
Yes.

89
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,810
Hello, I-I-it's like this,

90
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:44,100
a few days ago, I sent a job application email

91
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:47,300
but never got a reply so

92
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,400
I want you to help me check on it.

93
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,970
No reply means you are eliminated.

94
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,700
Then I want to ask, what the reason was for being eliminated?

95
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,800
I'm not quite sure about that.

96
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,600
Thank—

97
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:22,200
Hello?

98
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,100
What are you doing?

99
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,400
Meeting.

100
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,900
What's wrong?

101
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It's nothing.

102
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,690
I-I'm just talking to a customer

103
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:37,500
and it's not going that well.

104
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,600
What's the matter?

105
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,900
Nothing. I just wanted to talk.

106
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,000
Why are you all just sitting there?

107
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,100
It's been two weeks and you guys haven't gotten it done. You are basically helping me lose face.

108
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:13,500
Sales depend on legs! One phrase, go grab! 

109
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,600
 Go grab the customers for me!

110
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,000
 Here.

111
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,800
 I haven't even finished the one you gave me last time.

112
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,600
 Have it as backup. Your stomach isn't good. Pay attention to what you eat.

113
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,500
Lin Ling, come here for a second.

114
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,200
Sister Siyu.

115
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,410
Lin Ling.

116
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,300
I'm sorry.

117
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,400
Sister Siyu.

118
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Go to the Human Resources Department and complete the resignation procedures.

119
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,600
Sister Siyu, you said you'd take me under your wing.

120
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,400
I regret, okay? I'm going back on my word, okay? I don't honor promises, okay?

121
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,200
Sister Siyu.

122
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,500
Don't start with nonsense and get out!

123
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:43,400
Why would a workaholic like you show up here at this time?

124
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,600
I don't want to go to work today.

125
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,300
What happened?

126
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,200
It's just the stuff happening at the office.

127
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,400
Just watch "Empresses in the Palace" a few times and you won't have as many troubles.

128
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,700
Oh right!  If you see Chen Yiming, apologize to him for me.

129
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:08,900
His friend, Lei something, I didn't show him any respect today.

130
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:16,000
Lei Haowen, he is a bit self-righteous and loves to brag.

131
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,100
- But he is good person. 
 - Yeah, right.

132
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:22,800
I was wondering why Chen Yiming would have a friend like him.

133
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,400
Chen Yiming... has been strange lately.

134
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:40,600
He always says he's meeting with clients yet I don't see the clients.

135
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,900
 Why are you by yourself? Where's your client?

136
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,500
 The c-client just left.

137
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:52,100
Also, he always looks like he has a lot on his mind.

138
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,100
He also keeps secretly looking at his phone.

139
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,600
- Could it be that he has a mistress? 
 - That's not possible.

140
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,200
Those are the symptoms of men who cheat.

141
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,000
Chen Yiming wouldn't.

142
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,500
Why do you trust him so much?

143
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:14,600
If we do not have at least that much trust, why would he propose?

144
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,600
Let me tell you. You must not

145
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,800
let down your guard just because a guy proposes.

146
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,000
Also, didn't the proposal not go through?

147
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,900
- Isn't it because of you? 
 - Hey, don't shift the blame on me.

148
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,900
Isn't it because you're scared of marriage?

149
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,600
Afterward, he didn't mention proposing again.

150
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,400
That is also very strange.

151
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,400
You, oh, you. When he proposes, you are conflicted.

152
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,200
When he doesn't propose, you are also conflicted.

153
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,000
Why don't you just ask?

154
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,400
How do I ask?

155
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:50,400
"Chen Yiming, when are you going to propose again?"

156
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,400
You are a novice in terms of love.

157
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,600
You're saying that like you understand it very well.

158
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,000
At least I have met more players than you.

159
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,800
Let me tell you. Some men are just restless.

160
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,600
It's just whether there is a chance for it to be revealed.

161
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,100
Phone.

162
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,800
- Xiao Jia. 
 - Sis, GM Lin of Arad Company asked for a quote.

163
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,200
What do I say?

164
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,400
Give him the price for old clients.

165
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,800
Okay. That's it then, Sis.

166
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,600
Hey, that...

167
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,800
Did Lin Ling finish her paperwork?

168
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,400
Lin Ling? I think she went to Youyou Rabbit.

169
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,400
Why did she go to Youyou Rabbit?

170
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,600
I don't know about that.

171
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,600
- Are you leaving? 
 - I have something to do at work.

172
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,000
Chen Yiming, you have to be careful.

173
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,200
Showcase? Booths? Is there at least a red carpet?

174
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,600
Have you ever seen an exhibition that uses this color carpet?

175
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,600
- Come here, come here. 
 - Can you come or not? At the time we said.

176
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,000
Look at this backplane. 

177
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
The logo! Where is the Youyou Rabbit logo?

178
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,400
Let me tell you. We've informed leaders. We've informed the media.

179
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,200
Even the distributors are here yet this is what you guys gave me.

180
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,200
Do you still want to hold the exhibition next year?

181
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,700
What did you two say?

182
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,900
What did you two say? Tell me!

183
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,200
Tell me what to do!

184
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,400
- Lin Ling.
 - Sister Siyu.

185
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,600
Director Jiang, calm down.

186
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,400
- Why are you here? 
 - What happened?

187
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,800
They have a big distributors conference tomorrow. But the PR company they hired is not reliable.

188
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:44,000
They suddenly left and left this mess.

189
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
What are you doing now?

190
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,800
I was... helping out.

191
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,000
I already fired you so why did you come here?

192
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,400
Sister Siyu, I want to give it one last go.

193
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,200
There is no chance.

194
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,600
You told me that one cannot simply wait for an opportunity. You must fight for an opportunity.

195
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,500
- Do you listen to everything I say? 
 - Yes.

196
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,500
You are the only one who has told me...

197
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,500
that I can.

198
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,900
I know that I've already been fired,

199
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,200
but before I leave,

200
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,600
I want to prove to myself

201
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,800
that I can.

202
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,300
 Why did you just tell me now? 

203
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,200
 I know. I know. 

204
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,800
I told you guys to set the tables and you guys couldn't do it well.

205
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:37,200
I told you guys to arrange the chairs and you  guys couldn't do it well. There's no guest list and you don't know how to arrange the seating.

206
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,200
 What can you all do? 

207
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,800
What about the booth? I told you guys a month ago to prepare it.

208
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:45,400
- Zhizhi, s the stage from the exhibition at the beginning of the year still there? 
  - Why are you guys so useless?!

209
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:49,000
That's great. I need to use it now. Help me start the application process.

210
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,800
Thanks.

211
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,800
Xiao Jia, call everyone to come help at Youyou Rabbit.

212
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,800
All right, Sis.

213
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,000
Team 2, everyone, listen up.

214
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,800
I just got Sister Siyu's call.

215
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,950
Everyone go to Youyou Rabbit to help Lin Ling get the deal.

216
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,700
This is an exhibition.

217
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:14,200
Everyone should be clear about the situation, right? Everyone knows what they're supposed to bring, right?

218
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,200
- We'll go to it. 
 - Then let's get going.

219
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,600
- Bring the LED screen. 
 - Come in.

220
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,400
Sister Yuan, didn't you assign Youyou Rabbit to me?

221
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,200
- Why's it Lin Ling's again? 
 - No way.

222
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,600
- You guys get in my car. 
 - Okay.

223
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,000
Put stuff into the other car.

224
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,200
I sent the address of Youyou Rabbit to your phones already. Hurry up.

225
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,400
Be careful when you drive.

226
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,900
- Sister Yuan. 
 - Li Siyu.

227
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:45,400
Youyou Rabbit is Liu Jie's client. What going on with Lin Ling poking her nose into it?

228
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,400
Youyou Rabbit has always been Lin Ling's client.

229
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,800
After Lin Ling was fired, I had Liu Jie take over.

230
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,000
Lin Ling hasn't been officially fired yet, right?

231
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,260
Also, the company's record

232
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,600
shows that it is Lin Ling's.

233
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,750
Li Siyu, don't you forget

234
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,600
how I mentored you in the beginning.

235
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Sister Yuan, I didn't forget.

236
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I'm doing what you taught me.

237
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,200
What'd you say?

238
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,400
When I first got into Lubao, I had two straight months of no sales performance.

239
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,000
It was you who didn't give up on me and led me step-by-step.

240
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,600
That was how I found my confidence and breakthrough. 

241
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,900
Now, I'm mentoring Lin Ling just like how you mentored me.

242
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,500
Sister Yuan, what'd she say?

243
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,600
- Let it be. 
 - How can we just let it be?

244
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,400
If I say it's fine, it's fine!

245
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,400
Sister Yuan, someone that you fired

246
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,200
she forcibly took them in. Your clients, she forcibly steals them.

247
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,100
Isn't it obvious that she is going against you?

248
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,900
Get out.

249
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,100
- Where's Sister Siyu? 
 - She's inside.

250
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,700
You guys, hurry up! They are waiting inside.

251
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,000
Lin Ling, confirm the list and seating arrangement of the guests.

252
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,800
Xiao Jia, you're in charge of printing and placing the name tags.

253
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,400
- Xiao Tian. 
 - Here.

254
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,300
- You're in charge of the welcome banner. 
  - Got it.

255
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:33,100
- Xiao Wu, put the LED lights up. 
  - Okay.

256
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,800
You two. Go over to the audio setup and help out.

257
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,600
You three, come here.

258
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,300
- Come with me. 
 - Hey!

259
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,900
Are you guys from the PR company?

260
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,400
We're from Lubao.

261
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,800
GM Jiang, this is Manager Li.

262
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,000
Manager Li, this is GM Jiang.

263
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,570
GM Jiang, I heard from Lin Ling that your company has had some problems.

264
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:57,200
We can help out.

265
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,000
Don't worry. Even though we are not a professional PR company,

266
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,200
but I have organized all of Lubao's distributor events.

267
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,500
We guarantee that tomorrow's event will go smoothly.

268
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,800
Manager Li, is that right?

269
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:12,200
I want to tell you that for the next 6 months,

270
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,600
- our company has no plans of ordering batteries.
 -That's fine.

271
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,200
After half a year, we may not have those plans as well.

272
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,680
Director Jiang, whether you buy them or not,

273
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,000
I'll be helping you guys today for sure.

274
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,500
Let's go.

275
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,230
Even though life is hard, I still have hope.

276
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:01,720
I won't give up.

277
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:31,690
Hello, Liu Yang. When will you come back?

278
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:33,830
I still have some work to do. I'll be back soon.

279
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:36,740
Can you hurry back? I have to go out soon.

280
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:40,480
- We can't leave Yuwei at home all alone. 
 - Where are you going?

281
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,930
Didn't I tell you? I have a meeting with Miao Miao's mom and the others.

282
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:50,080
I don't understand why you insist on mingling with that crowd.

283
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,230
I'm doing all of this for Yuwei, of course.

284
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:56,980
Didn't you realize that ever since Yuwei started to hang out with those kids,

285
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:59,710
her outlook has become different?

286
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:02,500
I suddenly got urgent work to do so I need to attend to it right away.

287
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,100
I may need to do overtime and can't go home.

288
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,310
Hey, Liu Yang! Hello?

289
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,100
Little ancestor, don't jump. It's dangerous.

290
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:19,090
Sit down, baby.

291
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:39,860
Sister Siyu, I got the proposal that Yiming revised for me.

292
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:42,280
It's really good. Thank you.

293
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,100
I'm pretty busy right now.

294
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,770
I think I'll be busy until after midnight. I can't talk right now.

295
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:59,300
Aunt Mei!

296
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:02,560
- Xiaoling, can you please watch Yuwei for me? 
 - Me?!

297
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:05,100
- I'll come get her later. 
 - But...

298
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,890
I gotta go. Bye.

299
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:08,870
Hey! Zhizhi!

300
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:15,110
- Come in. 
 - Aunt Mei!

301
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:16,880
Close the door.

302
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:23,080
It's pretty good.

303
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,970
You picked quite a good picture.

304
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,410
There's a good amount of content.

305
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:37,490
Yuwei's mom's proposal

306
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,620
is actually quite professional.

307
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,260
It's quite pretty, quite pretty.

308
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:43,930
I'm flattered.

309
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:47,110
- Take a look. See what you want to drink. 
 - Our old ones were also quite high quality.

310
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:51,010
I drank too much water before leaving. I already feel full. You guys can order.

311
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:53,350
Let's eat some desserts.

312
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:56,390
I'm on a diet lately. You guys can order.

313
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:58,790
- You're so skinny yet you're dieting? 
 - I've gained weight.

314
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,930
What about this one?

315
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:26,950
Yuwei, my high heels are super expensive!

316
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,090
Fine, fine. I don't blame you.

317
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:32,810
Auntie will get you some food, okay?

318
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:38,110
I only have low-fat crackers and juice. Do you want to eat that?

319
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:44,870
Auntie, look! I was drawing your mouth!

320
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:56,450
Zhang Zhizhi, you better hurry up and take your daughter back!

321
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:03,330
She has already caused over ¥20,000 in damage!

322
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,160
When she grows up, I'm making her to repay me!

323
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,650
Ahhhhhh!

324
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:09,580
I'm about to be tortured to death!

325
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:12,090
Auntie, look!

326
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:24,650
Do you like to draw?

327
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:26,770
I'll teach you how to draw.

328
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:30,200
Tomorrow, Yuwei's mom and I will start preparing the decorations for the site.

329
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,690
You guys do what you are assigned then.

330
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:37,740
Let's end the meeting here for today.

331
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,650
Waiter, check please.

332
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:42,800
Hello. It's ¥1672.5

333
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:53,920
Yuwei's mom, we're paying the bill.

334
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,650
I paid already. Let's go.

335
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:57,690
I'm kind of tired.

336
00:27:57,690 --> 00:27:59,590
Hey, I paid already, too.

337
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:02,590
Let's go. Let's go.

338
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:33,730
Hello, Xiaoling. Are you not home?

339
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:36,580
Where are you guys?

340
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:38,660
Great. I'll go over right away.

341
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,350
Zhizhi!

342
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,660
- Where's Yuwei? 
 - Bathroom.

343
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,500
Bathroom?

344
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,680
How could you let her go to the bathroom by herself?

345
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,920
You need to let her learn how to be independent starting from a young age.

346
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,520
What if there's a human trafficker?

347
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,170
The world doesn't have that many human traffickers.

348
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:03,210
Mom!

349
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:31,110
Gu Xiaoling!

350
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:36,390
What is wrong with you? How could you put this much makeup on her?

351
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:37,770
Mom! Look!

352
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:41,300
Yuwei liked it, so I did it for her.

353
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,730
Is this poisonous?

354
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:45,770
All of these are from big named brands. Very safe. Trust me.

355
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:47,290
She's still a child!

356
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:50,460
Mom, there's also this!

357
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,820
We walked past a makeup store and got them pierced.

358
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:54,680
How could you do this to Yuwei?

359
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,340
Come here.

360
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:02,430
- Come here. 
 - But they're so pretty!

361
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:08,380
Auntie said that women must treat themselves well!

362
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:10,500
Yuwei is correct!

363
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:16,470
Gu Xiaoling, you really are something.

364
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:19,530
- Bye, Auntie! 
 - Bye, Yuwei!

365
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:22,390
Zhang Zhizhi, do you want me to watch Yuwei tomorrow as well?

366
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:24,780
Never again!

367
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:27,990
Hello? Haowen, send me an email.

368
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:32,530

00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,530
How come everyone is working overtime tonight?

377
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:24,800
If you don't leave, then it's not right for them to leave either.

378
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,830
- Why? 
 - Cause you're the team leader.

379
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:36,060
Tell everyone to hurry home. I'm about to leave as well.

380
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:38,930

381
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,640

 - See you.

- Liu Yang, you're back? 
 - Yes.

386
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:15,130
I had Xiaoling take care of Yuwei,

387
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:17,550
and the result is this.

388
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:20,710
How could you let Gu Xiaoling take care of Yuwei?

389
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:22,780
You had to work overtime and I had a meeting.

390
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:25,270
I was only able to find Xiaoling to help.

391
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:27,620
You still went?

392
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,880
Don't argue in front of her.

393
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:39,170

395
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:48,000
Do you want three meats or cabbage?

396
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,600
You decide. You won't listen to what I say anyway.

397
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:54,920
You're the head of the family though.

398
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:00,670
Is there anything else you'd like to eat? I can make it for you.

399
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:08,120
- Lin Ling, I'm going to head back in a bit. Keep an eye on things here. 
 - Got it.

In addition, the agenda has already been discussed with the host. Everything's been discussed.

407

All of the activities have already been discussed with the people in charge.

408

The plan is already in order.

409
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,310
Thank you. Thank you. I'm really grateful.

410
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:42,400
Director Jiang, don't be so polite. Thinking and worrying for the client is our duty.

411
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,990
The most important point is that our company is not your client.

412
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:48,830
Even if you're not our client, you're still a friend.

413
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:52,140
Aren't friends supposed to help each other?

415
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:58,090
- Director Jiang. 
 - Manager Wang,

416
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:00,730
Go and create a contract immediately.

417
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:04,450
Our business will order 500,000 batteries from Lubao ahead of time.

418
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:08,190
Notify the finance department to prepare the deposit.

419
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:12,280
Our production line will not be operating until half a year later.

420
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,690
Director Jiang, you don't have to do this.

421
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:19,010
Didn't you say that we are friends? I also consider you guys my friends.

422
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:22,170
Just take this as my personal thanks to you

423

 - Yes.

425
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,900
But sincerity needs to be realistic.

426
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:33,370
What? You don't trust my abilities?

427
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:35,630
Well, then... Thank you, Director Jiang.
