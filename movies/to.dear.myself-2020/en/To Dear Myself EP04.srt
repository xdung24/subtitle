00:01:26,575 --> 00:01:29,625
[To Dear Myself]

2
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:33,450
[Ep4]

3
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,040
Come in

4
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:50,439
Sister

5
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:52,079
Here's team A's list

6
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,719
Huang Bibo, Kuaizi, Afu

7
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:55,560
Zhou Zhiyu, Yang Tian

8
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,400
And Zhang Jiaqi

9
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,159
I get it

10
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,775
As I know, after we went out today

11
00:02:02,775 --> 00:02:06,450
sister Yuan talked to them in office one by one

12
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,275
And she let them sign to follow her

13
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:11,680
Really?

14
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:15,000
So now except you

15
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,400
top ten salesmen go to her team

16
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,080
Show me that

17
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,075
Sister, she did this on purpose?

18
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,520
Please come in

19
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,439
Sister Yuan

20
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,759
You can go out now

21
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,199
Close the door

22
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:50,759
Ok

23
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,240
Anything wrong?

24
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,479
You deliberately lured me away

25
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:01,525
Then you talked them into choosing you 

26
00:03:01,525 --> 00:03:02,975
rather than me one by one

27
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,159
What are you talking about?

28
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:05,520
Who am I?

29
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:06,840
Did I say anything wrong?

30
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,950
You think I need to do so?

31
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,319
How's the trip?

32
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:26,639
The contract

33
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:29,240
Siyu

34
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,960
You have said, you wouldn't compete with me, right?

35
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:34,560
Yes

36
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,840
Why do you care who select me rather than you?

37
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:42,439
How about this?

38
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,159
This commission will be yours

39
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:45,759
Ok?

40
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,199
Liu Yang

41
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,639
Time to eat

42
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,360
Time to eat, stop playing

43
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:21,560
I am running late

44
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,680
I won't eat now

45
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,319
Just put it here after eating

46
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,240
I will wash after I come back

47
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:26,959
Where are you going now?

48
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,079
I told you yesterday

49
00:04:28,775 --> 00:04:30,480
I need to attend the meeting with Miaomiao's mom

50
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:32,639
What about Yuwei after you attend meeting?

51
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:34,199
You are here

52
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:36,040
I need to work

53
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,920
I am working, too

54
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,560
Goodbye mom

55
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:40,835
Bye, baby

56
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:46,680
That's all

57
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,279
Ok

58
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:47,920
Thank you

59
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,120
You said, your boyfriend would come too

60
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:56,000
Why he is not here?

61
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,279
Maybe he is on the way

62
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:02,439
Xiaoling wanted to come, too

63
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,519
But it's her night shift

64
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:06,600
She wants me to tell you

65
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,000
She is so sorry for the trouble

66
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,360
I'm sorry, too

67
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,319
It's ok

68
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:19,399
President Wang

69
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:22,607
Sorry for the lateness

70
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:24,079
It's ok

71
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:25,120
Sorry

72
00:05:26,675 --> 00:05:28,759
I hurried but I am still late

73
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,079
Sister Ziru, thank you

74
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,240
I am so grateful for your proposal

75
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,120
It's a little case

76
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:40,920
It's our fault

77
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,250
But we can't let you pay the price for us

78
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,959
So I will pay the money

79
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,120
Yes, Ms. Wang

80
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:50,360
Thank you for your kindness

81
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,800
I hope you can accept the money

82
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,279
I can't

83
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,519
Sister Ziru

84
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,763
I can't use it even if I accept it

85
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,759
All the procedures are done

86
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:11,959
We can't change it now

87
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:15,959
Please accept it

88
00:06:16,725 --> 00:06:19,519
So we could feel better

89
00:06:24,075 --> 00:06:28,400
You can't make yourselves better by making troubles for me, right?

90
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,319
Sister Ziru

91
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:43,600
We will owe you a big debt

92
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:46,040
It's ok

93
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:49,885
Maybe in the future I need your help

94
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,319
You can pay me back then

95
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:56,120
Ok

96
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,199
Ms. Wang, thank you

97
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,720
Just tell us anytime you need help

98
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,959
Sister Ziru, thank you

99
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,480
Siyu, are you busy lately?

100
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:17,920
Very busy

101
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,040
As busy as bee

102
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,839
Great

103
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,639
So your industry is prosperous

104
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:25,920
Just because it's not prosperous

105
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:28,279
We have much pressure now

106
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:33,720
Yiming

107
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,480
What do you do?

108
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,240
Planning director

109
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,800
An interesting industry

110
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:40,439
It's ok

111
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,439
In which company?

112
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:46,160
Just a small company

113
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,439
Not small, Caijin company

114
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:49,720
Highly ranked in the industry

115
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,120
As I remember last year

116
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,680
the market value is 800 million

117
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,000
Almost

118
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:57,759
Thanks to his planning last year

119
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,279
his company's market value increased by two billion

120
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,975
No, I can't take all the credit

121
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,399
Young and promising

122
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:08,175
He is the youngest planning director in the history of his company

123
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,879
Stop it, ok?

124
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,560
It's true

125
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,439
Excuse me

126
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,160
President Pan

127
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,720
Let me ask you

128
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,360
What's going on with your team?

129
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:35,039
They made the choice

130
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,039
What are you thinking about?

131
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:41,639
I...

132
00:08:42,558 --> 00:08:43,158
Thank you

133
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,159
I think nothing

134
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,559
Li Siyu

135
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,985
You have no confidence in Lubao right?

136
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:08,919
What happened?

137
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,440
You are scolded again?

138
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:13,120
He is so tough

139
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:16,240
What's wrong?

140
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,679
This way please

141
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:21,879
Not many people today

142
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,759
Yes

143
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,000
Let me show you

144
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,279
I ordered a pink diamond

145
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,559
Not many people today

146
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:51,519
Come, hurry up

147
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,720
I don't like today's weather

148
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,240
It's cloudy

149
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,720
A good view here

150
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,240
Yes, I ordered here specially

151
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,320
Next to the window

152
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,039
Great

153
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:02,759
Yes

154
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:03,840
I booked in advance

155
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,240
Check the list out

156
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:07,679
What drinks do you want?

157
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:08,840
How about wine?

158
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,000
My driver didn't come with me today

159
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,039
I drove by myself

160
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,440
I also drove myself

161
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,759
So drink wine next time

162
00:10:15,225 --> 00:10:16,879
Give you some alcohol-free drinks 

163
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:18,000
No need

164
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:19,519
Juice is great

165
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:23,200
So who will draw up the plan this time?

166
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,120
You recommend...

167
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,320
Fruit juice

168
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,320
Fresh juice

169
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,440
Alcohol-free?

170
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,080
I can

171
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,200
You?

172
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:34,720
Really?

173
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:36,600
Ok

174
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,360
Ok

175
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:40,240
They recommend this

176
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:40,960
Ok...

177
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,200
Ok, just order that

178
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:45,080
Ok

179
00:10:45,525 --> 00:10:48,120
When I was CEO in a foreign company

180
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,350
I hated the calls at the meeting most

181
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:55,120
Yuwei's mom, what do you want to drink?

182
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,279
I want this one

183
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,120
A soda

184
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:01,960
If I compete with sister Yuan hard,

185
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:03,080
I will feel sorry for her

186
00:11:03,925 --> 00:11:07,120
Otherwise I will feel sorry for president Pan 

187
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,360
Also sorry for myself

188
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,875
I don't know what to do now

189
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:26,200
Why does it become like this in the end?

190
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:29,039
Things all changed after I came back from Ningbo

191
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:37,039
So you don't need to make a decision so soon

192
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,080
Time and tide wait for no man

193
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,320
I usually decide with coins

194
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:46,759
Do you have coins?

195
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,519
No

196
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:55,480
I have one here

197
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:00,320
Let's make a deal

198
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:03,519
If the pattern is up

199
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,475
you need to compete for the director

200
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,550
If the number is up, you will give up

201
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,120
Ok

202
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:35,720
It's the destiny

203
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,039
No, Siyu

204
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:44,320
I am not trying to tell you what to do with this game 

205
00:12:44,825 --> 00:12:47,425
I want to let you know what you really want

206
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,039
When you see the number is up

207
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:51,960
you are so disappointed

208
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:54,440
It means you don't want to give up at all

209
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:00,879
Yes

210
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:07,278
If I were you, I would follow my heart

211
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,639
Yuwei's mom

212
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,879
Can you give me your plan tomorrow?

213
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:27,840
Ok

214
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,799
We will discuss about it tomorrow night

215
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:32,879
Ok  -The same place and time, ok?

216
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:33,799
Ok

217
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:36,519
That's all for today

218
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:38,679
Waiter, settle the bill

219
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,759
Hello, 1935 yuan

220
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:47,200
Ok

221
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,080
Send it to the group, and we will tranfer the money

222
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:49,720
Ok

223
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:51,519
Ok

224
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:52,559
Ok

225
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,120
I have transferred the money

226
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,080
So cold

227
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:17,799
Yes

228
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,490
Your clothes looks pretty when the wind blows

229
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:24,639
Really? I like it

230
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:27,360
You didn't drive, Yuwei's mom?

231
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,000
I didn't drive today

232
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:31,320
I ate too much

233
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,720
I'll take a taxi after walking

234
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,159
Ok, bye

235
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:35,120
Ok, goodbye  -Bye

236
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,399
Bye...

237
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:36,960
Wait

238
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,080
Ok, bye

239
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:40,639
Bye bye

240
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:41,600
Bye

241
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,720
Bye, Yuwei's mom, see you tomorrow

242
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,279
Bye bye

243
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,120
See you tomorrow

244
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:54,759
Bye bye

245
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,919
Liu Yang, just called me

246
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:30,480
What?

247
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:41,879
Goodbye

248
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:42,639
Goodbye, president Wang

249
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,775
I think sister Ziru knows me well

250
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:03,080
So you will compete against her?

251
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:07,569
I need to think about it

252
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,639
Who?

253
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,799
No, it's a spam message

254
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,360
Spam message

255
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:27,720
Why are you laughing so happily?

256
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,120
No

257
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,120
I'm worried

258
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,320
What are you worried about?

259
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,559
I am worried about you

260
00:16:35,775 --> 00:16:37,840
I don't know what's going on between you and sister Yuan

261
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,679
No one told me

262
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,840
I said it, it's unexpected

263
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:43,720
And that afternoon I called you

264
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,879
you threw the tantrum

265
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,000
When did I throw the tantrum?

266
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:49,840
Did I?

267
00:16:50,775 --> 00:16:52,720
You should tell me before you go to Ningbo, right?

268
00:16:52,975 --> 00:16:55,664
Otherwise if friends ask me where you are

269
00:16:55,664 --> 00:16:56,919
what should I answer them?

270
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,279
If I say I don't know,

271
00:16:58,279 --> 00:17:00,000
what's our relationship?

272
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:02,320
Ok...

273
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,925
You have so many things to do and worry about every day

274
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:07,759
I don't want to disturb you

275
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:08,440
Let me tell you

276
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,960
I don't mind other things

277
00:17:14,118 --> 00:17:15,278
but you must disturb me with love

278
00:17:19,974 --> 00:17:23,679
Next time do tell me if you go far

279
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,599
How far is it?

280
00:17:29,775 --> 00:17:33,335
As long as house price within 30,000 per square meter

281
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,319
So I need to ask the house price before I go anywhere

282
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:38,599
So troublesome

283
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,880
That's exactly what I mean

284
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,160
I need to think about it

285
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:56,759
How's it?

286
00:17:57,599 --> 00:17:59,500
Anti-allergic treatment works

287
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,720
We still need observation

288
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,119
If she has no other symptoms in 1 hour,

289
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:06,240
you can go home

290
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,640
Thank you, doctor

291
00:18:07,975 --> 00:18:10,680
She is so allergic

292
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:14,440
You can buy her an EpiPen

293
00:18:14,775 --> 00:18:17,680
It can save her life in emergency

294
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,680
I will find one EpiPen for you

295
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:19,960
Ok, thank you

296
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:28,599
What happened?

297
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,880
She wanted to drink milk

298
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,519
I told her to get it herself

299
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,200
But she took chocolate

300
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,488
I prepare the chocolate for you in case you work late

301
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,319
It contains peanuts

302
00:18:43,575 --> 00:18:45,759
I hide it very inside the refrigerator deliberately

303
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:48,119
I don't know

304
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,559
Why don't you keep a good eye on her?

305
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,039
How can she open the refrigerator by herself?

306
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,240
Why didn't you keep a good eye on her?

307
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:57,839
I was engaged

308
00:18:58,359 --> 00:18:59,519
Engaged?

309
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,000
Gosh

310
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:09,240
You talk to mom

311
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:10,519
What?

312
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,400
Hello

313
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,359
Yang

314
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:17,359
Mom

315
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:19,880
I sent you another pack of medicine

316
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,720
Did you receive it?

317
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:23,200
Yes

318
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,240
Did you finish the medicine I sent last time?

319
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,519
Yeah

320
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:32,200
So go on taking the medicine

321
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,599
I get it

322
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:35,519
It can warm the uterus

323
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:39,759
The medicine is very effective for Li Sanwa's wife

324
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:41,359
They have twin sons now

325
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:43,400
Mom, Zhizhi is next to me

326
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,240
You can talk to her

327
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,240
Mom

328
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,759
How's it? Any movement?

329
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:57,799
What movement?

330
00:19:58,825 --> 00:20:01,400
You didn't boil the medicine in the right way?

331
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,440
Or, I can go to boil it for you personally?

332
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,400
No need, mom

333
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,920
We can do it ourselves

334
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:07,319
Ok

335
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,759
I will wait for your good news

336
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:24,160
Mom wants to come here?

337
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,519
Don't let her come

338
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:30,119
Otherwise we will be in trouble

339
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,100
Why does your mom urge us to have second child?

340
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,079
All the neighbors have given birth

341
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,880
And they are boys

342
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:45,519
She is jealous and eager

343
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,960
What do you think of it?

344
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,799
Second child?

345
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:51,400
I will go crazy

346
00:20:51,925 --> 00:20:55,359
It's so hard for us to support Yuwei

347
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,279
So next time if your mom talks about this again

348
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,079
you should make it clear

349
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:04,225
It's impossible for me to changer her mind

350
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,880
Flowers for you, do you like it?

351
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:08,799
Yes

352
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:34,519
May I ask, which friend sends this?

353
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,920
Sir, your coffee

354
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:53,640
Thank you

355
00:21:53,799 --> 00:21:54,400
You're welcome

356
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:06,559
As I know, you broke up with Lanke

357
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,359
Who told you?

358
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:15,000
Someone saw him go shopping with a new girlfriend

359
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:19,200
I dumped him

360
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,480
Why?

361
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,079
He is so clingy

362
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:23,119
I can't stand it

363
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:24,920
Really?

364
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,279
If you don't believe me, you can ask him

365
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,759
Who sends you flowers every day?

366
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:42,920
So mysterious

367
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:45,000
I don't know. So annoying

368
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,680
Really?

369
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:51,079
Latest policy

370
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:52,839
It will go into force on the 1st of next month

371
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,319
What policy?

372
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:02,319
The company is so damn poor

373
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,440
Gosh

374
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,839
Even sell group purchase

375
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:11,075
120 ice cream balls and two cups of coffee with 159 yuan

376
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,200
Yes

377
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,759
Now everyone can come in

378
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,279
It's a membership that costs half a million yuan

379
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:19,079
Now they can play for half a day with 159 yuan

380
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:20,880
What a fall in price

381
00:23:21,175 --> 00:23:23,119
We will fall in price as well

382
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:27,240
I should prepare myself for MBA study

383
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:30,000
What can you learn with your competency?

384
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,625
At least it can help me elevate myself

385
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,960
Hello, waitress

386
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,559
Yes

387
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:44,880
Be careful

388
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:47,839
Be careful

389
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:49,079
Ok

390
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:50,599
Go

391
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,066
A team leader, now you have so many things

392
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:55,519
Printer, paper shredder

393
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:57,279
All the tools you need

394
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,240
By the way, sister Siyu

395
00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:01,680
Yuwei's class will hold a party

396
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:03,559
The theme is I love mom

397
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,480
I drew up the planning

398
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,680
But I am not satisfied with it

399
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:08,880
Can you help me?

400
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,519
You should ask Yiming for help

401
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,880
It's his forte

402
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:14,119
I can help you transfer your plan to him

403
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,440
Ok, I'll transfer it to you right away

404
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:17,039
Sorry

405
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,720
Lin Ling

406
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:21,400
From your sales department

407
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:23,640
I know

408
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:27,039
I guess, she just finished the resignation procedure

409
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:29,319
She is so miserable

410
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,279
Her dad was found lung cancer for not long

411
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:32,640
She needs money now

412
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:33,720
How do you know?

413
00:24:34,175 --> 00:24:36,640
She asked me about the medical insurance days ago

414
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,640
Now it's difficult to find a job

415
00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:05,279
Lin Ling

416
00:25:10,039 --> 00:25:11,559
You want to join my team, right?

417
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,559
Yes, but...

418
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:17,839
Go to tell Liu Xiaojia

419
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:21,700
You are joining my team now

420
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:24,640
Sister Siyu

421
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:27,559
Sister Siyu

422
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,200
You will offend sister Yuan

423
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,039
None of her business

424
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:33,960
Yes

425
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:50,640
Hello

426
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:51,319
Hello

427
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:52,599
I am here for an interview today

428
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,559
What is your name?

429
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,440
Chen Yiming

430
00:25:54,839 --> 00:25:55,839
Chen Yiming

431
00:25:56,519 --> 00:25:57,519
Take a break here

432
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,480
Ok, thank you

433
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:04,880
Hello

434
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,039
Hello

435
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,480
What? She took Lin Ling in?

436
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,160
Yeah

437
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,960
She was going through the resignation procedures

438
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,000
But she stopped it

439
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,480
Sister Yuan

440
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,599
She hired the one you fired

441
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:22,920
What does she want?

442
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,319
We fire her, why do you keep her stay?

443
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,440
I want to help her

444
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,440
So you are doing something good

445
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:35,799
Correct

446
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:38,799
You can give her money yourself

447
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:41,240
You let the company pay her the basic salary

448
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:42,079
What is this?

449
00:26:42,925 --> 00:26:45,000
You help her at the company's expense?

450
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,720
President Pan

451
00:26:47,375 --> 00:26:49,680
I have told HR department

452
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:53,582
I will pay Lin Ling's basic salary

453
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,079
Three months

454
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,960
Her sales performance is zero

455
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:06,920
What does this mean?

456
00:27:07,275 --> 00:27:10,039
It means she is not suitable for this work

457
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,839
Not suitable for the company

458
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:12,559
Do you know?

459
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:16,000
I have read her work log

460
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,160
She worked very hard for these three months

461
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,880
She just lacks some method and luck

462
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,599
Give her another three months

463
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,200
She will make progress

464
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,200
Impossible

465
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,480
Why?

466
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,200
I am preparing for equity financing

467
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:31,680
Sales revenue in the next three months will

468
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,039
determine the company's valuation

469
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:35,496
So I don't have time for you to train her

470
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,200
I need data

471
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,799
The rising data

472
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,100
The data that brings capital confidence

473
00:27:43,319 --> 00:27:44,480
Only one month

474
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,720
Let her stay if she signs an order

475
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:49,400
Otherwise I will fire her

476
00:27:56,359 --> 00:27:58,279
I know you are very compassionate

477
00:28:00,039 --> 00:28:01,720
But the company cares only about interests

478
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,960
Compassion has no place in the company

479
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:05,519
I know

480
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:10,359
But I can't...

481
00:28:10,359 --> 00:28:11,279
Li Siyu

482
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,640
Li Siyu

483
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:20,200
Sometimes the blind kindness is very irresponsible

484
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,725
for others, for ourselves

485
00:28:22,725 --> 00:28:26,876
for the company and for the overall situation

486
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:32,160
I get it, president Pan

487
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:34,400
Chen Yiming

488
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:53,640
Sister Siyu

489
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,000
Sister Siyu

490
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:05,960
This is the party's plan

491
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,680
When do you need it?

492
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:08,839
Tonight

493
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,519
Moms group will discuss about it

494
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:13,039
Then we will split up according to the plan

495
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:15,319
I'll contact Yiming right away

496
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,440
You are born in 1980s?

497
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,599
Yes

498
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:34,720
Don't underestimate me just because of my age

499
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:36,880
Actually I have 10-year experience

500
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,480
No...

501
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,665
Our company products are for post-90s

502
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:42,599
You are a bit old for us

503
00:29:45,125 --> 00:29:47,640
So you think thirties are old?

504
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:51,775
If you are mentally young, we can consider

505
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,059
You have good Wemedia's resources

506
00:29:58,075 --> 00:30:02,925
Yes, I am one of those who recognize the power of Wemedia

507
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:05,759
Wemedia is outdated

508
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:08,279
Now it's convergence media's world

509
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:12,480
You are right

510
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,599
The number you have dialed is busy now

511
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:17,319
No one answered?

512
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:20,799
What should I do?

513
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:22,519
I promised Miaomiao's mom

514
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:24,000
I would give her the plan today

515
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,884
Miaomiao's mom values time

516
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:28,400
A woman of principles

517
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,119
If I can't give her a plan, she will be angry

518
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,559
Don't worry, I will go to see him

519
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:45,575
You designed Caijin's Qingyun plan?

520
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:48,160
Yes, it's me

521
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:52,473
Last year our company analyzed Qingyun plan

522
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:53,759
Really?

523
00:30:54,375 --> 00:31:02,325
I think if I have another chance, I can do it better now

524
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:05,720
Yes, the foundation is very good

525
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,200
But the planning is not good enough

526
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:11,160
If the planning team can do it,

527
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:14,875
Caijin company can increase market value by 500 million

528
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:20,680
Thank you

529
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,119
Zhang Shengyun

530
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:00,200
I called you but you didn't answer

531
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,079
You also didn't reply my message

532
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:02,880
I need to see you, it's urgent

533
00:32:03,079 --> 00:32:04,240
I am on the way to your company now

534
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:07,359
I need to see you, it's urgent

535
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:11,675
I am on the way to your company now

536
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:45,319
Hello, Yiming

537
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,759
Siyu, where are you now?

538
00:32:48,039 --> 00:32:50,275
I am parking downstairs in your company

539
00:32:50,839 --> 00:32:51,960
Don't go up

540
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,599
I am not in the company now

541
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:54,759
Where are you?

542
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,839
I am talking with the client

543
00:32:57,839 --> 00:32:59,440
Ok, I'll go to meet you there

544
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:16,799
Waiter

545
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:17,759
Wait a moment

546
00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:43,200
Siyu, here

547
00:33:48,839 --> 00:33:49,759
Why are you alone?

548
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,119
Where is the client?

549
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:52,799
He just left

550
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:54,200
Waitress

551
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,119
Clean it up

552
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:04,559
Come

553
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:13,960
What's the matter?

554
00:34:15,225 --> 00:34:17,159
Help Zhizhi with the plan

555
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,719
Finish it before you get off work

556
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:20,000
So anxious?

557
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,225
Yes, so I came here

558
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,480
No

559
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,719
I have two meetings in the afternoon

560
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:34,760
I also have an appointment with a client

561
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,479
Finish this first

562
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,960
It's about Yuwei's status in the kindergarten

563
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,159
It's about Yuwei's social circle

564
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:42,239
It's about Yuwei's future

565
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:45,000
You have exaggerated

566
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,480
Zhizhi told me so

567
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,760
Ok...

568
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,239
Ok, I will do this first

569
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,880
What to drink?

570
00:35:01,239 --> 00:35:02,000
No

571
00:35:14,039 --> 00:35:15,960
What's wrong?  A bad mood?

572
00:35:21,239 --> 00:35:22,480
I was impulsive today

573
00:35:23,575 --> 00:35:26,159
I kept an intern that company fired

574
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,519
Why?

575
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,440
Her dad has lung cancer

576
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:33,119
My mom died of lung cancer

577
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,559
I can understand

578
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:39,360
But everyone

579
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:41,039
including president Pan

580
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,679
They think I am wrong

581
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,000
Because the company only cares about the interests

582
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:45,800
It doesn't care about compassion

583
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,880
Am I wrong?

584
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,880
We are human beings, we have feelings

585
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:51,559
But the company only cares about interests

586
00:35:59,159 --> 00:35:59,880
Siyu

587
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:06,125
Do you know where you attracts me most?

588
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,760
My beauty is unparalleled

589
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,920
It's your kindness

590
00:36:18,519 --> 00:36:21,785
I think your kindness conquers all the interests

591
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:29,880
Thank you Yiming

592
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,039
I know what to do

593
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,960
If she can't work in Lubao

594
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,850
can you find a job for her in your company?

595
00:36:45,239 --> 00:36:46,239
Well, I...

596
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:47,840
I am afraid I can't

597
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,719
You always complain that you are understaffed, right?

598
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,440
You may not know what's going on

599
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,925
Our company is downsizing greatly this year

600
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:00,575
Your company developed so well last year, right?

601
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,719
It's last year

602
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:04,880
It's changed now

603
00:37:09,159 --> 00:37:10,079
I get it

604
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:15,599
Siyu

605
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:21,880
If I am fired...

606
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:22,920
Impossible

607
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:24,880
No matter how difficult the market is

608
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,159
neither of us will be laid off

609
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,400
So weird

610
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,159
Who? Me?

611
00:37:38,025 --> 00:37:39,480
No, I think you are so weird

612
00:37:58,325 --> 00:38:00,159
How long will this class take?

613
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:01,920
It starts tomorrow afternoon

614
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,840
Hello

615
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,679
Are you interested in this major?

616
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:18,625
What's your requirement of the art appreciation

617
00:38:18,625 --> 00:38:21,345
and art institution management?

618
00:38:21,719 --> 00:38:22,840
Do you have a drawing basic?

619
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,199
Yes

620
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:26,039
Did you bring the works?

621
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,360
Look at my face

622
00:38:29,239 --> 00:38:30,119
I painted it myself

623
00:38:34,039 --> 00:38:35,320
How is your foreign language?

624
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:37,239
French and Italian

625
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,000
Louis Vuitton, Chanel

626
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:40,599
Hermes, Prada

627
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:41,400
Enough...

628
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:16,760
Xiaoling

629
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:18,559
Hello

630
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:20,519
Where are you going? Let me give you a ride

631
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:22,239
No thanks

632
00:39:22,559 --> 00:39:23,920
This is downtown

633
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:25,559
It's hard to grab a taxi

634
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,199
It's windy, get in

635
00:39:40,199 --> 00:39:41,360
After you left last time

636
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,440
actually I tried a lot of opportunities 

637
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,320
to make an appointment with you

638
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,159
I asked Yiming for many times

639
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,575
My brother is so unreliable

640
00:39:51,239 --> 00:39:53,239
He doesn't help me at all

641
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:03,625
I didn't expect I would see you again 

642
00:40:03,625 --> 00:40:06,006
in the vast crowd on the street

643
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,320
What a serendipity

644
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,800
I have to cherish it

645
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,920
Let's play a game

646
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,000
Ok

647
00:40:14,875 --> 00:40:16,800
The game is Who Talks First Loses

648
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,030
From now on, we will keep mouth shut

649
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:20,159
Who speaks first will lose

650
00:40:21,039 --> 00:40:21,840
The loser will invite the winner to dinner

651
00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:22,920
Let's start

652
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:27,599
Xiaoling

653
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,360
You are more beautiful than last time

654
00:40:33,559 --> 00:40:34,920
I lost...

655
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,800
Punish me...

656
00:40:37,159 --> 00:40:39,475
Tomorrow, the day after tomorrow

657
00:40:39,475 --> 00:40:40,559
You can choose the place

658
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:44,360
The named called Lei is Chen Yiming's good friend?

659
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,960
Actually I have no opportunity 

660
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:46,599
Yes

661
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:47,920
to introduce myself formally

662
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,039
I will help him

663
00:40:49,039 --> 00:40:50,159
My name is Lei Haowen

664
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,079
L-E-I

665
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,079
H-A-O

666
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,880
W-E-I

667
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:00,880
You had a little misunderstanding about me last time

668
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:04,320
What?

669
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:07,000
The sports car belonged to you last time?

670
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,960
Not mine

671
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:11,760
It belongs to my nanny

672
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,599
What about this one?

673
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,880
Don't underestimate this car

674
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:20,400
The price is only 300, 000

675
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:25,199
I earned it in my college with my part-time wages

676
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:29,277
So I drive it often

677
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,800
For the reminiscence of my youth

678
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,280
I am a rich son

679
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,575
But I have no vices

680
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:43,880
I can see it

681
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,039
Really?

682
00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:49,760
You know, what's the biggest vice of a rich son?

683
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:51,880
It's his richness

684
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,920
And you don't have

685
00:41:56,575 --> 00:41:59,199
If you want to judge a man by richness

686
00:41:59,199 --> 00:42:01,880
the behavior is so superficial

687
00:42:03,519 --> 00:42:04,840
You mean I am so superficial

688
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,079
No...

689
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:07,239
I didn't mean that

690
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,199
You are right

691
00:42:08,199 --> 00:42:09,480
I'm superficial

692
00:42:09,559 --> 00:42:11,400
People all have shortcomings

693
00:42:11,559 --> 00:42:12,760
I don't think it's a shortcoming

694
00:42:15,175 --> 00:42:19,575
If a girl is vain and mammonish

695
00:42:19,575 --> 00:42:22,280
she will lose a lot of precious things

696
00:42:23,079 --> 00:42:23,880
For example

697
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:31,709
She will lose a potential, attractive and powerful man

698
00:42:32,519 --> 00:42:36,119
I think with my vulgarity and vanity

699
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:40,239
I don't deserve an attractive, potential and powerful man

700
00:42:40,239 --> 00:42:40,719
No

701
00:42:41,039 --> 00:42:42,159
You deserve one

702
00:42:44,719 --> 00:42:45,320
Gosh

703
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:45,920
What's wrong?

704
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,400
Pull over, I have arrived

705
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:48,679
You want to go to the subway entrance, right?

706
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:51,599
I can't take it anymore

707
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:52,760
I feel sick

708
00:42:59,000 --> 00:42:59,840
Carsick?

709
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:01,679
Sick of you

710
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,559
What are you talking about?

711
00:43:07,159 --> 00:43:07,840
Gu Xiaoling

712
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,639
What do you mean?

713
00:43:09,639 --> 00:43:13,025
I beg you don't say hello to me when you see me next time

714
00:43:13,425 --> 00:43:16,119
You can't hurt my feelings just because you are beautiful

715
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,199
It's my legitimate defense

716
00:43:18,199 --> 00:43:19,559
Serve you right

717
00:43:19,559 --> 00:43:23,250
Who says hello to you will be doomed to be a bachelor forever
