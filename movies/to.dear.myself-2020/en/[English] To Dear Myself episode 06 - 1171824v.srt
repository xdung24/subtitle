[Episode 6]

4
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:22,730
Last night, I worked overtime until about 4:00 a.m. again.

5
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,620
 Group Two members! Hurry! We have to gather together!

6
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,030
 Everyone got a ¥20,000 reward!

7
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,980
 I'm sorry. I woke up too late this morning. When I saw your text,

8
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,260
I was so busy thinking about the company and I have been busy ever since.

9
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,760
Sister Siyu! Sister Siyu! The company gave us all prize money!

10
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,170
Calm down, calm down.

11
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:11,260
"Group leader Li Siyu gets a 20% raise,

12
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,700
as well as prize money of ¥20,000.

13
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:17,500
Lin Ling gets ¥10,000 as a prize, and everyone else in group two gets ¥20,000.

14
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,960
¥20,000!

15
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,250
What? Let me see.

16
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:26,470
"In recognition of the hard work and pursuit of perfection by group two,

17
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:29,470
the company has decided to give awards."

18
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:41,880
Did you see? A raise of 20% and a reward of 20,000!

19
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,950
- The cake! The cake. Sister, we're leaving now. 
 - Bye!

20
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:01,970
The company gives a bonus of ¥50,000 for a ¥500,000 order. Does the company still have rules?

21
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,960
Our company does have rules,

22
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,950
but they don't apply to Pan Zhiyong.

23
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:10,670
His word is law? Is this company run singlehandedly by him?

24
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:15,150
He's the major shareholder, as well as the chairman and general manager.

25
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:18,800
You're also a shareholder. You're even the vice president of this company!

26
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:21,580
Yes, I am the vice president, but

27
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:24,500
I have no control over the Finance Department or personnel.

28
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,690
I'm in charge of the security guards, customer service, and sales.

29
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:30,190
Only one core department, the Sales Department.

30
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:33,460
And because of my care, it has threatened you. My management even threatened your position.

31
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,660
Senior Brother, I don't blame you.

32
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,610
Sit.

33
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:57,980
To be honest, according to seniority and skill,

34
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:01,090
you are the best candidate for the sales director.

35
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:04,130
But Pang Zhiyong ignored my words at the conference.

36
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:07,470
He insisted in selecting the sales director in this way.

37
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,720
The most obvious reason

38
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,420
is that you will be led by me instead of him.

39
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,860
My leader has always been you. Of course, I'd listen to you.

40
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:21,220
So, in his eyes,

41
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,530
you're not his employee at all.

42
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:26,100
He won't give you this position.

43
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:28,640
Then...

44
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,910
Li Siyu's his?

45
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:37,810
In the past, maybe not, but after notice,

46
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:40,330
he sure seems to think so.

47
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,140
Siyu promised me before that she wouldn't fight me.

48
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,660
Then why did she, for a ¥500,000 order,

49
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:52,350
make all of her employees work until dawn?

50
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,520
She's already started to battle you.

51
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,870
You're still denying it?

52
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:03,740
Siyu isn't the type. She takes friendships seriously.

53
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:07,960
People change. Especially when it benefits them.

54
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:12,400
The Li Siyu now is not the one from before.

55
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,140
At least now you have time. Don't hesitate any longer.

56
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,850
Let me think about it.

57
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:29,420
Indecision invariably leads to trouble.

58
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,060
- Sister Yuan. 
 - Sister Yuan.

59
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,940
What's wrong?

60
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:12,400
We want to ask if there's anything else we need to do?

61
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,060
What else could there be? Go steal some orders.

62
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,650
- Cheers! 
 - Keep fighting!

63
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:35,590
Sister Siyu.

64
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,760
Thank you.

65
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,980
Why thank me? You were the one who got the order signed.

66
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:44,230
Thank yourself.

67
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:47,690
Without you, this order wouldn't exist.

68
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:51,340
Without you, it wouldn't exist either.

69
00:07:56,450 --> 00:08:00,790
Honestly, before yesterday,

70
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:02,930
regarding my father's illness,

71
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,430
I had already given up inside.

72
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:10,930
But after getting the order signed,

73
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:13,670
I have gained hope again!

74
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:19,100
As long as I don't give up, as long as I persist,

75
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:23,110
my father's illness can definitely be cured.

76
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,890
Lin Ling, we will keep fighting with you.

77
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:29,820
There will definitely be miracles! Hang in there.

78
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,710
- Yes. 
 - Keep fighting!

79
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:34,470
Close more deals following Sister Siyu!

80
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:36,690
Get more bonuses!

81
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:40,190
- We will keep getting better! 
 - Keep fighting!

82
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:42,420
They're so arrogant.

83
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:46,290
I'm announcing...

84
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:50,570
I am giving my prize money and commission all to Lin Ling.

85
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,540
Use it to pay for your father's medical bills.

86
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:58,510
Sister Siyu!

87
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:01,380
I will follow you for the rest of my life!

88
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,120
It's just a few tens of thousands.

89
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,040
You act as if you've never seen the world before.

90
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,090
Sister Siyu, rest assured.

91
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,630
For the next three months, I will work as if my life depends on it.

92
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:14,310
Both for myself, and for you.

93
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:17,390
I will bring you up to the Sales Director position!

94
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:22,090
- Yes! 
 - Sales Director!

95
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:23,650
Please don't say that.

96
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:26,680
I'm saying it! We're definitely going to beat sales group one

97
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,520
and let Sister Siyu become the Sales Director!

98
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:32,710
- We must win! 
 - Fighting!

99
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:47,190
Everyone, listen up.

100
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,460
I...

101
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,280
I...

102
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,960
My stomach feels uncomfortable.

103
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,730
Sister.

104
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:19,650
I'm not going to say anything else. Let's take a picture together as a memento and get back to work.

105
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:22,360
Great!

106
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,620
Here.

107
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,560
Closer!  Closer!

108
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:35,700
1, 2, 3. Yeah!

109
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:40,630
- Let's cut the cake! 
 - Yes!

110
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,890
It looks good.

111
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,710
I'm in a meeting.

112
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:19,040
Eat this!

113
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:24,440
Hey, you're here again today?

114
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:30,380
A radish is ¥1.50.

115
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:32,560
It's fresh today.

116
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,760
- Edamame? 
 - Yeah.

117
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,620
- Please weigh some edamame out for me.
 - All right. How much?

118
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:39,420
- Like... 500 grams.
 - All right

119
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,350
Here, that's ¥10.

120
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:50,170
- How much is it? 
 - ¥10.

121
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:52,660
I remember that yesterday you sold it for ¥12. Why's it ¥10 today?

122
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:55,130
Is it wrong if I reduced the price?

123
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,540
This is the same stuff as yesterday, the same quality as yesterday,

124
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,380
how could you just say you're going to reduce the price?

125
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:03,520
I can't sell them. You won't let me reduce the price?

126
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,640
I don't want it.

127
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,570
You're crazy.

128
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:20,270
There is nothing in life that can't be solved with a delicious meal.

129
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,890
If there is, then eat two meals. 

130
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:26,090
So that's saying that good cooking skills is the root of happiness in life.

131
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:32,510
Cook the oil on medium-high heat. Then quickly pour it over the pepper rings.

132
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:37,510
Cut the red peppers, 

133
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:39,260
onions, and leeks into strips.

134
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:43,630
Put the well-marinated chicken into a pot with pieces of garlic, ginger, and sauces. 

135
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,570
Cook until tender.

136
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:51,690
Immediately immerse it into ice water.

137
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:54,200
Soak the dry peppers in hot water.

138
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,550
Start taking the meat off the well-marinated chicken.

139
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:01,100
- Why're you here? 
 - You're home?

140
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,120
Use this type of pepper oil that can be found in the city.

141
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,450
You need to add more pepper oil.

142
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:08,090
Then add the chicken soup.

143
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,430
After mixing it well, let it sit to let the flavor sink in.

144
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:13,080
After it's done, sprinkle on some white sesame seeds. 

145
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,430
Weren't you in a meeting?

146
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:23,780
Did I come at the wrong time?

147
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,310
Xiaoling was right.

148
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:32,080
Some men just want drama.

149
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:34,410
What?

150
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:39,750
Chen Yiming, tell me the truth.

151
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,990
Who did you make these dishes for?

152
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,370
Myself.

153
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:49,710
You're still trying to lie to me?

154
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,700
I'm not lying to you.

155
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:57,050
I knew early on that something was wrong.

156
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:59,130
I just didn't say anything.

157
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,330
There's nothing wrong.

158
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:04,670
Do you dare to give me your phone?

159
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:15,680
Siyu.

160
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:19,250
Siyu!

161
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:22,380
Siyu! Siyu.

162
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,910
Don't touch me! Don't.

163
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:27,330
No, wait, no. It's not what you think.

164
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:30,090
- Why don't you come back and I'll explain?
 - Let go.

165
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:31,650
Siyu.

166
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:37,250
Let go. Let go right now.

167
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,630
Don't make me fight you.

168
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,570
I don't have a job.

169
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,140
I lost my job.

170
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,840
What?

171
00:14:56,810 --> 00:15:01,220
I-It w-was two weeks ago.

172
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,320
I got fired.

173
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,060
How's that possible?

174
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:16,240
Yeah, I thought it was impossible as well.

175
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,670
B-But it happened.

176
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:31,420
S-So every day, I have nothing to do.

177
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:34,510
So I make food to pass the time.

178
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:44,840
That's great.

179
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,830
That's great!

180
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,950
That's great.

181
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:53,780
Are you okay?

182
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,870
What's so great about this?

183
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:58,730
Turns out that you lost your job.

184
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:01,940
I thought that you had a change of heart.

185
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:17,010
Dad!

186
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:22,990
- Where's Mom? 
 - She went out.

187
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:28,050
- When did she leave? 
 - She left after eating.

188
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:32,250
Your mom left you alone here? She's so irresponsible!

189
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,600
Son,

190
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,380
- you're home? 
 - Mom.

191
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:39,920
Have you eaten yet? I'll make something for you.

192
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,000
- I brought back your favorite— 
 - Wait, Mom!  When did you come back?

193
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,720
- I came in the afternoon. 
 - In the afternoon?

194
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,650
Zhizhi said that you work late and that you're busy, so I didn't call you.

195
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:54,300
- Yuwei. Mom. I'm home. 
 - You're home?

196
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,220
You're home, too?

197
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:01,840
Why didn't you tell me as soon as possible?

198
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:05,170
I was planning on telling you after I found a new job.

199
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:07,040
Then are you looking?

200
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,760
Yeah. The first day I came home, I started looking.

201
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:13,730
But I  haven't found one yet.

202
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:19,420
That's fine. You just lost your job.

203
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:22,870
It's not like you lost yourself. It's not that bad.

204
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:26,300
A company like Caijin, that's greedy and lacks insight,

205
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,860
staying there is just wasting your life.

206
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:32,760
Them firing you is one of the luckiest things that has happened to you.

207
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,920
There must be a company that is better and more powerful than Caijin waiting for you.

208
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,780
I also thought that.

209
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:43,770
These past few weeks I've sent out almost 50 emails applying to different jobs.

210
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:46,230
But I've been getting almost no responses.

211
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:49,190
That's because you haven't met your fate yet.

212
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:51,210
Finding a job is like finding love.

213
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:54,230
It depends on the right time, right place, and right people.

214
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,880
Then maybe I have to re-evaluate my own abilities.

215
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:03,340
You don't need to. You are the best.

216
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,750
What am I good at?

217
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:09,650
You are able to not believe in yourself but you can't not believe in my judgment.

218
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:12,950
The men I like definitely aren't lacking.

219
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:21,160
Siyu...

220
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,160
thank you.

221
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:39,410
Go take a look.

222
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,470
- A new job is knocking on the door. 
 - I'm not looking.

223
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:47,510
- Go. Just go. 
 - No.

224
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:49,240
Come on, just go.

225
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,830
Just go take a look.

226
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,860
What is it?

227
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:18,260
I got rejected again.

228
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,960
I already lowered my desired salary.

229
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,500
But still no one wants to employ me.

230
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:16,470
[You're here]

231
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:21,690
[I'm here]

232
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:27,630
[This is Shanghai]

233
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:32,500
[We're working towards our dreams]

234
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:36,540
This is all what you liked to eat when you were little.

235
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,920
Zhizhi called me

236
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,860
and said that Yuwei missed me. And I missed her, too.

237
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:44,740
So I just got moving.

238
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:49,320
Mom, you should've still told us. Then we could've gone to the train station to pick you up.

239
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,810
Isn't all of that heavy?

240
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:52,910
It's not heavy. This is nothing.

241
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:54,750
I've already come so many times.

242
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:58,040
After getting off the train, go straight to 34th Street,

243
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,520
then go eight stations. Once I get off, I'm home.

244
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:03,420
Mom, now that you're here, just stay a few more days.

245
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:06,820
Didn't you say your heart hurt? Let's go to the hospital for a checkup.

246
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,410
No need. I'm fine.

247
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:10,950
Oh yeah. Zhizhi will go make an appointment for you tomorrow.

248
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:13,820
No need. I know my own body.

249
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,600
Moreover, I brought medicine.

250
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,420
Look, there's medicine for the heart, for leg pains...

251
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,010
and stomach medicine.

252
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:24,280
These days there are big fluctuations in the weather. If you guys are feeling unwell, you guys can have some, too.

253
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,220
You don't need to go through so much trouble.

254
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:29,610
Mom, don't just take medicine. It's better to go to the hospital.

255
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:31,500
All right, I got it.

256
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,720
Grandma, Grandma, play with me!

257
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,740
I'm coming. I'm going to play with

258
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,560
- my baby granddaughter.
 - Mom,

259
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,430
we still have to go to the hospital.

260
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:44,530
If something's wrong then we can treat it. If nothing's wrong then we'll stop worrying.

261
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:48,180
All right, I got it. I got it.

262
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:59,210
Why didn't you discuss it with me before telling my mom to come?

263
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:02,180
What are you saying? This is your mom.

264
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:05,040
Also, I didn't tell her to come.

265
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,620
Mom said that her heart doesn't feel right.

266
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,730
I naturally had to respond.

267
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:12,700
So I said, well then come and get it checked out.

268
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:15,020
What did I do wrong?

269
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:20,610
Don't think I don't know what you're thinking.

270
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:22,570
You just want Mom to take care of Yuwei,

271
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:27,080
so you can hang out with those so-called privileged mothers.

272
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,180
I did this for Yuwei.

273
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,760
I didn't do anything wrong.

274
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:35,830
Let's sit down here.

275
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:38,020
- These type of people. 
 - That's right.

276
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:41,430
You guys... how do you feel about this

277
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,400
I'm saying this...

278
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,800
Just give up!

279
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,000
I have been selling cloth all these years, can't you see?

280
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,820
This is about my family.

281
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,400
How can you be like this.

282
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,800
Second Uncle. Fourth Uncle. Stop bickering.

283
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:17,300
These three pieces of cloth are all from Shanxi.

284
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,300
- No way! 
 - Yeah, it's impossible!

285
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:23,200
I cut these off of the weaver.

286
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,000
I don't think so.

287
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,800
This is not it.

288
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,600
- Hello? 
 - Hi. Are you Mr. Chen Yiming?

289
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,200
Yes, I am.

290
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,060
We received your resume,

291
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:49,700
and it really suits our company's needs. 

292
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,200
Do you have any time this afternoon?

293
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,400
Our chairman wants to interview you.

294
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,800
Yes. I have time. When and where?

295
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:05,400
I will text you the specific address and time later.

296
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:09,400
Great. Also, what's your company's name?

297
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,000
When you meet our chairman, you will know.

298
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,800
West Nanjing Road at 3:00 p.m.

299
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,300
3:00 p.m.

300
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,600
3:00 p.m.

301
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,600
Xiaochen?

302
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,200
I'm here.

303
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,300
Siyu.

304
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,100
How come you're here?

305
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:05,100
I have an interview here at 3:00. They're almost here.

306
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:08,600
Mr. Chen. I'm the one who is conducting the interview.

307
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,700
Please don't joke about this.

308
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:14,400
Mr. Chen. Please introduce yourself briefly.

309
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,200
I don't have time to fool around with you. I really have an interview at 3:00.

310
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,600
Fine. Your introduction is on your resume already. I don't need it.

311
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,500
Right. What are your strengths?

312
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,200
Are you actually the person who brought me here?

313
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,800
How are your driving skills?

314
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,500
Nonsense.

315
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,900
I have an offer for you.

316
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,300
How about you take a look?

317
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:05,100
The annual income of this position is ¥0,

318
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,400
but you can get a promotion.

319
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:11,200
You can be promoted into a father,

320
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,800
grandfather,

321
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,140
and if you live long enough,

322
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:18,200
you could also be promoted to a great-grandfather.

323
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,400
It's not impossible.

324
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:34,700
I know. Recently, you kept getting rejected,

325
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:38,800
but it's not because you're not skilled. It's because it's not the right time.

326
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,800
Take a look. Our company saw your strengths,

327
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,000
and immediately made a move.

328
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,530
Don't be depressed and don't

329
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:51,400
look down on yourself.

330
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:56,100
Also, our company has also prepared a welcoming gift.

331
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,200
What is this?

332
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,700
Take a look.

333
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,000
[The Best]

334
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,000
Siyu.

335
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,000
Thank you.

336
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:49,800
Mr. Chen, if you are interested in this position,

337
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:53,000
please bring a diamond ring to work.

338
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,610
I trust that you will be a very

339
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:58,400
perfect husband.

340
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,900
Siyu,

341
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,200
I'll keep the offer.

342
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,470
The present,

343
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:19,400
I will also keep.

344
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,280
I will definitely take the job,

345
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,100
but not right now.

346
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:30,460
Why?

347
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,800
I think...

348
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:39,300
I don't meet your needs.

349
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,600
Please...

350
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
give me a little more time.

351
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,470
I will bring you a real offer

352
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:51,200
to start the job you offered.

353
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,800
Thank you.

354
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,800
Thank you.

355
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:28,400
This is our company's new product introduction and brochure. How many copies do you want?

356
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,400
Please ask Sister Liu.

357
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,000
Okay. This is our company's new product introduction and brochure.

358
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,400
Ask Sister Liu.

359
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Hi. This is our company's new product introduction and brochure. How many copies do you want?

360
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,600
Group one doesn't want them. Let the administration department store them for us.

361
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,500
Okay.

362
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,200
The marriage proposal failed.

363
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,000
How is that possible?

364
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,800
No way!

365
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,200
Why?

366
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,200
- Miss Gu. 
 - Coming!

367
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,500
You deserved it.

368
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,600
Have some more.

369
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,200
Take this.

370
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,600
I can do it myself.

371
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,800
Yuwei usually doesn't eat extra after coming back from preschool.

372
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,600
Today, she ate such a big bowl of rice.

373
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:30,200
Grandma's lion head tastes so good!

374
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,000
Good.

375
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,800
- Hurry and thank her. 
 - Thanks, grandma!

376
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:39,200
Don't thank me. If you like it, I'll make you nice things every day.

377
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,000
- Mom, you've worked hard. 
 - No.

378
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:47,200
Does Liu Yang always come home so late?

379
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,340
Yes. Recently, the company has been kind of busy.

380
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:51,600
He's been working overtime a lot.

381
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,500
I'm finished. I need to go.

382
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:01,000
Please take care of Yuwei for me.

383
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,600
Sure. Go work.

384
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,800
She can't eat peanuts or watch too much TV.

385
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:11,200
I get it. I'll take care of her, rest assured.

386
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,400
Listen to grandma, okay. I'm leaving.

387
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,600
Go, go, go.

388
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,900
- You're back? 
 - It smells so nice.

389
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:26,100
You're back? Hurry and wash your hands.

390
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,800
I made you a lot of food you like.

391
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,000
You're leaving again?

392
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Mom is here. It won't hurt you.

393
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,200
Hurry.

394
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:53,000
- Where is your mom going? 
 - She's preparing for a party with Miao Miao's mom.

395
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,300
- What does that mean? 
 - "I Love Mom."

396
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,400
What are you saying? I don't understand.

397
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,000
Mom, don't ask.

398
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Let her do whatever.

399
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,600
Hurry. The food is going to get cold.

400
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,000
I'm washing my hands.

401
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:18,320
These things can all be found online, and they're half as expensive.

402
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,360
Things online don't have texture.

403
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:25,790
Linda's mom made an estimate.

404
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:29,450
Everyone who goes to the party has to pay 1.5 thousand.

405
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:31,460
Do you think that's too low?

406
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:34,560
1.5 thousand is low?

407
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,560
Well, if they gave three thousand,

408
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,650
then we could invite children's drama clubs from abroad over to perform.

409
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:41,340
If it's 1.5 thousand,

410
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:43,400
we can only invite one from in the country.

411
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,780
Well, they're all putting on makeup and masks.

412
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:48,710
I don't think you can tell the difference between foreign and from here, right?

413
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:51,730
The difference is gigantic! Even if it was all from abroad,

414
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:54,750
London and New York are such different places.

415
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:57,890
- They're completely different things. 
 - Really?

416
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:02,010
Right, Yuwei's mom.

417
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:04,100
Did Yuwei ever come home and tell you

418
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,870
that Doudou likes to hit people?

419
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:08,820
No.

420
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:11,680
Miao Miao has cried about it multiple times.

421
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,770
She says that Doudou always pulls her hair

422
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:16,660
and kicks her all the time.

423
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,140
Did you tell the teacher?

424
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:22,780
Of course. There's no use.

425
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:25,970
Today, Doudou still stole her toys.

426
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:27,790
Really?

427
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:32,730
Who do you think her parents are?

428
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:34,910
How come they don't discipline her at all?

[Job Hunting Network]

431
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:24,570
What did you eat for dinner today?

432
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:28,020
Have you finished your homework?

433
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:32,380
Did you memorize your text?

434
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:35,580
What about vocabulary?

435
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:42,100
Good. Leave it there.

436
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,260
When I come home, I'll sign it.

437
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:52,060
- Continue. 
 - Sister Yuan,

438
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:54,340
Group 2 is acting like a bunch of crazy people.

439
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:57,560
Yeah, Sister Yuan. Lin Ling works overtime until 12:00 a.m. every day.

440
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,420
The interns in group two act like they're high on drugs.

441
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:02,050
Xia Xiaotian is the worst of them all.

442
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:04,480
She's already starting to bug my clients.

443
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,770
This is exactly the effect they want.

444
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:09,410
But I heard that Xia Xiaotian's performance these days

445
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:11,760
already surpassed our Huang Bibo.

446
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,580
- Really? 
 - I also heard that

447
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:17,320
Jia Shu from Degao Batteries wants to come to our company

448
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:20,310
and specifically said that he wanted to be in Li Siyu's group.

449
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:23,750
If it actually happens, I fear that we won't even be worthy opponents.

450
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:25,680
You look down on Sister Yuan.

451
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,710
But Li Siyu's group has so much momentum.

452
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:33,840
Sister Yuan, I also think we cannot let our guard down.

453
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:41,090
The current Li Siyu is not the same one as before.

454
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:44,010
You still have some time. Don't hesitate.

455
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:46,450
 Fighting!

456
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:56,650
My target today is 5 effective visits.

457
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:59,320
Then I'll continue to communicate with the A Lai De company.

458
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,890
Then I'll continue talking with the new clients.

459
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:03,250
Come in.

460
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:06,690
Sister Siyu, Director Fang wants you to go to the conference room.

461
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:09,940
Okay. Wait for me.

462
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,240
We have hope for this one.

463
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:19,910
This is from last month.

464
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:23,180
Director Fang.

465
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:29,500
- Director Zhou. 
- Please sit, Siyu. Director Zhou has some things to discuss with you.

466
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:36,090
This is the invoice you gave the Finance Department last month.

467
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:40,930
- Yes. 
 - Please explain what this ¥500 is doing here.

468
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:44,950
What you claimed is the PR fee on the 25th.

469
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:48,690
But the invoice was from the 4th of last month.

470
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:50,490
This ¥500 was overtime money.

471
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:53,200
Overtime money has its own application process.

472
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,890
It's because the application process for claiming it was too confusing,

473
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:57,650
So I used the restaurant invoice as replacement.

474
00:39:57,650 --> 00:40:00,950
Sister Yuan knows about this. She signed here.

475
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:04,550
You think just because Yuan Hui signed this, you can be let off so easily?

476
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:07,230
General Manager, what are you trying to say?

477
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:10,420
It's clear that you misreported the PR fees.

478
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:14,670
I can sell 100,000 kilowatt-hours in one year. Do I need to make a false report about this ¥500?

479
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:17,360
On the one hand, you earn hundreds of thousands in commissions;

480
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,780
but on the other, you find ways to take smaller bits of money from the company.

481
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:22,810
- I've dealt with so many people like you. 
 - How dare you say that?

482
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:26,360
- There's evidence. 
 - Go conduct an investigation of the Sales Department before drawing conclusions!

483
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:30,000
Li Siyu, just because you became a group leader doesn't mean that

484
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,850
the company isn't afraid of punishing you.

485
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:36,160
Punish me however you want. I didn't misreport the fees.

486
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,850
He Zhou, you guys should leave.

487
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:41,040
I'll talk to Li Siyu alone.

488
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:56,650
Li Siyu. Sit.

489
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:10,680
Li Siyu,

490
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:14,850
the Corporate Finance Department has already investigated the invoices you made these past few years thoroughly.

491
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:17,520
There is a total of ¥7,000 that was misreported.

492
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,160
All of that money was what I earned from overtime.

493
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,820
Strictly speaking,

494
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:25,250
you have committed acts of fraud and embezzlement.

495
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:28,140
Then that means everyone in the Sales Department is also committing crimes.

496
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,960
But they didn't report others' issues.

497
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:33,000
They only reported yours.

498
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:41,120
These files are in our office.

499
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:44,250
The Finance Department advises us to report you.

500
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,630
I talked to some lawyers.

501
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:50,180
According to the law, if you misreport over ¥5,000, the shortest sentence is 3 years in prison.

502
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:52,250
What?

503
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:54,040
If this really happens,

504
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,240
then your life is ruined.

505
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:01,630
Telling you the truth,

506
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:05,840
these years, you really did a lot for our company.

507
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,950
The company doesn't want to go through extreme measures.

508
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:10,090
We decided to let you make the decision.

509
00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:12,640
As long as you resign and leave Lubao,

510
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:16,320
the company will turn a blind eye to your actions.

511
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:20,700
I won't resign.

512
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:24,980
- Why? 
 - Because I didn't misreport even one RMB.

513
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:27,040
There's already so much evidence. You still won't admit it?

514
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,480
If I didn't do anything, why should I admit it?

515
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:32,550
- Then the company will be forced to report you. 
 - Go ahead!

516
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:37,310
Did you know that even if we reported you, you would still have to leave?

517
00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:40,430
When it causes a big scandal and the whole company is influenced,

518
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:42,720
do you still want to stay in the industry?

519
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,950
- I trust that the police will find me innocent. 
 - Do you actually think you'd be able to get through the investigation?

520
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:48,280
If I can't, then nobody here will be able to get through it!

521
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,670
You want to bring everyone in the Sales Department down with you?

522
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:53,810
I'm telling you. It's impossible.

523
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:56,110
There's only one way to solve this.

524
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:58,120
Resign!

525
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:01,250
I will not resign over this accusation.

Li Siyu, the company has already given you a chance.

528
00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:16,110
If you really insist on taking this road,

529
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:18,350
don't blame the company for being indifferent.

 [Dear Myself (亲爱的自己) by Zhu Yi Long (朱一龙), Keyso (寿君超)] 

531
00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:28,080
♫  How are you?  ♫

532
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:31,810
♫  Listen to me about the latest news  ♫

533
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:36,260
♫  Some sweet and some hopeless  ♫

534
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:41,230
♫  There are also some that were never said  ♫

535
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:44,810
♫  It's been so long, I've already learned to let go  ♫

536
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:49,330
♫  Let go of obsessions, of the present, and of greed  ♫

537
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:54,430
♫  Yet I've never thought of letting you go  ♫

538
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:57,820
♫  Yeah…  ♫

539
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:01,010
♫  Oh…  ♫

540
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:02,540
♫  En…  ♫

541
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:04,120
♫  Letting go…  ♫

542
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:07,680
♫  Dear Myself  ♫

543
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,580
♫  Listen to the voice inside  ♫

544
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:14,700
♫  In this lonely world, be cautious ♫

545
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:16,970
 After we're hurt, we learn to cherish  ♫

546
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:20,360
♫  Dear Myself  ♫

547
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:23,640
♫  Use all your strength  ♫

548
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:27,840
♫  Missing the simple you from the past  ♫

549
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:30,150
♫  Turn difficulties into courage  ♫

550
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:34,280
♫  Don't back down from the crowd  ♫

551
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:37,440
♫  Growth is inevitably accompanied by setbacks  ♫

552
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,120
♫  The best way to overcome difficulties is to smile  ♫

553
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:42,180
♫  All the punishment given by fate, are you afraid?  ♫

554
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:44,340
♫  Let everything go, all those concerns, real or fake  ♫

555
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:47,490
♫  Cannot erase the scar, but it's just a scar  ♫

556
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:49,130
♫  We are so small yet so determined  ♫

557
00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:51,020
♫  Occasionally fussy and occasionally firm  ♫

558
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:53,340
♫  If growth leaves a trace, then the trace is left be tears  ♫

559
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:56,990
♫  Your back that I've always been chasing  ♫

560
00:44:56,990 --> 00:44:59,180
♫  Finally turned around to hug me tightly  ♫

561
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:02,850
♫  It's still that familiar you  ♫

562
00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:06,240
♫  Yeah..  ♫

563
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:10,150
♫  Oh..  ♫

564
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:15,770
♫  Dear Myself  ♫

565
00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:18,990
♫  Dear Myself  ♫

566
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:23,010
♫  I'll give you the warm that the wind took  ♫

567
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:25,430
♫  Hugging you, hugging me  ♫

568
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:28,770
♫   Dear Myself  ♫

569
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:32,800
♫  The sky has finally cleared  ♫

570
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:36,050
♫  We've never been so clear-headed  ♫

571
00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:38,170
♫  Looking for the past me who  ♫

572
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:41,720
♫  Ran forward without evading anything  ♫

573
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:44,950
♫  Ran forward without evading anything  ♫

574
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:48,150
♫  Listen to the voice inside  ♫

575
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:52,660
♫  The sky has finally cleared  ♫
