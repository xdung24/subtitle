[Episode 32]

4
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:36,090
Chen Xiyi!

5
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:39,740
#1 in sales this month. Congrats!

6
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,220
Treat us to dinner!

7
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,340
Liu Jie...

8
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:52,170
Your performance declined the most. Old rule, you should be fined.

9
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:55,410
Director Yuan, I admit it.

10
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,030
Cai Yihui,

11
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:02,390
congratulations!

12
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:05,210
This month you're not last.

13
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:09,070
There's someone worse than her?

14
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:13,240
Cai Yihui, ¥520,000.

15
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,450
Zhang Zhizhi,

16
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,180
zero. Zhang Zhizhi,

17
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:27,220
didn't I give you a client? Where's the order?

18
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,160
The client kicked me out.

19
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,890
And then?

20
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:38,420
And then you never contacted the client again.

21
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:46,010
You're so arrogant.

22
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:50,030
Not contacting the client again after being rejected by him.

23
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:52,510
A person that arrogant should become a CEO.

24
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:55,240
What kind of sales persons are you?

25
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:00,210
Zhang Zhizhi,

26
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:03,290
I demand that you must get this client's order this month.

27
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:05,720
If you can't, then you can leave.

28
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:10,030
Cai Yihui, you must not want her to leave the most. Right?

29
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:13,430
As long as she's here, you won't be last.

30
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,450
Give some mercy to her.

31
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:18,870
Oh, you're nice now.

32
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:23,450
All right, one more piece of good news. This month

33
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:26,760
our sales group received a team award. Congratulations!

34
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,750
Thank you for your hard work. Let's keep on!

35
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,410
Good luck.

36
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,080
Zhizhi. Zhizhi,

37
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,010
are you all right?

38
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:32,370
We got paid.

39
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:35,610
Don't we always get paid today every month?

40
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,630
Basic salary plus all kinds of subsidy,

41
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,640
plus the bonus of the outstanding group.

42
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:53,690
The salary is 30% more than the salary of the admin department.

43
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:58,810
But you're leaving next month.

44
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,720
I have to stay here.

45
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,460
This company cheats!

46
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,810
This company cheats!

47
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:15,000
This company cheats!

48
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,830
Hey, bro! Bro!

49
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,750
Why don't we talk? Why don't we talk?

50
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,570
Come out!

51
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:24,190
- Where's your boss? 
 - I'm her.

52
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:27,030
Your people beat my husband and they didn't compensate any money!

53
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,800
What?

54
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,150
Move away!

55
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:34,160
Guan Xiaotang, are you okay?

56
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,740
They hurt people!

57
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,370
Let me go!

58
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:40,710
Can you stand up?

59
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:43,060
Go downstairs!

60
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,240
- It's okay! 
 - Are you okay?

61
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,590
My husband is their customer.

62
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:54,030
Her husband

63
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:59,800
rented a new battery but returned the old battery at our Laidianle service point. He was caught by our staff and they started to fight.

64
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,720
My husband was beaten seriously.

65
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,630
The medical expenses are thousands of yuan per day. They didn't compensate us at all.

66
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:07,590
The staff who beat him have already been detained by the local police.

67
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:11,370
That staff is in a contractual relationship with the franchisee.

68
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:14,400
The franchisee should bear the joint liability.

69
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,920
Our Laidianle and the franchisee are independent civil subjects.

70
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,330
So we shouldn't bear the liability, should we?

71
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:22,950
Are they reasonable?

72
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:25,570
My husband was beaten like that! They don't want to give any money!

73
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:27,700
Is it reasonable? Is there any law to punish them?

74
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,330
Let's listen to the police, okay?

75
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:32,420
Enough! This is the police station.

76
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,580
Police officer,

77
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:57,650
my husband is in an ICU unit right now. We need money to save his life!

78
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:00,790
We don't have any choice.

79
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:04,830
If you want compensation, you should go to the franchisee.

80
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:09,280
But now, you went to beat Laidianle's staff and smash things in their office.

81
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,800
You've already committed a crime!

82
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:17,990
Do you accept  mediation?

83
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:24,240
Mediation is okay. But I have conditions.

84
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:29,050
First, apologize to us. Second, compensate for all the losses we had.

85
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:31,440
What? You want us to pay a debt to you?

86
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,870
Older Brother.

87
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:41,520
This is the list of losses including the expenses of the renovation, furniture, and labor. This is the estimated price.

88
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:51,840
¥20,000!

89
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,160
It can't be less than that by a penny.

90
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:59,280
Sister, can you lower this a bit?

91
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,290
When you smashed things in my company, why didn't you think to hammer less things?

92
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:08,050
No, little sister, my older brother didn't mean to do it. He was just agitated at the time.

93
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:11,380
I apologize to you on his behalf. I'm sorry!

94
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,320
I'm begging you.

95
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,890
Fine, fine. I won't make you guys pay the debt.

96
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:21,820
But you need to write a written guarantee that you don't harass my company anymore!

97
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:26,280
You can't come to cause us trouble because you fought with our franchisee!

98
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,740
This...

99
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:32,780
All right. Think about it and decide quickly.

100
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,740
I will write it.

101
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:59,870
Police

102
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:03,830
Director Li.

103
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:08,480
I was worried before that our brand would be affected by the fighting issue.

104
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,070
I didn't expect that after you said those words,

105
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:14,340
our company would be extricated completely.

106
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:16,070
Wasn't I too cold-blooded?

107
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:19,060
Yes. Cold-blooded and cool.

108
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,910
Go to contact the franchisee there.

109
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:28,310
Let them pay the medical expenses first.

110
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:32,760
I asked them. They said they will compensate according to the court.

111
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,490
But now the court hasn't sentenced, so they won't pay anything.

112
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:42,400
Xiao Lu, what do you want to say?

113
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:48,630
Director Li, at some service points, some staff started without completing training before it became active online.

114
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:51,060
This one is one of those?

115
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:57,400
You think this incident is because they didn't get enough training?

116
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:02,340
How come? They used scrapped batteries to replace new batteries. If I were him, I would also beat them as well!

117
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:06,110
I don't know. I just realized this.

118
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,430
Only we three know this. Don't spread this.

119
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:14,390
Other points with untrained staff will stop service today.

120
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:17,240
Until all the staff are qualified.

121
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,670
Okay.

122
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,150
You really don't need to go to the hospital?

123
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,680
No.

124
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,030
Does it still hurt?

125
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,420
I'm used to it.

126
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,050
Do you get hit often?

127
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:39,680
Yes. I... was hit in the butt last time.

128
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:41,990
You should also be to blame.

129
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:46,660
You didn't know how to avoid the hammer? Luckily, it just hit your back! What if it hit your head?

130
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:51,830
I didn't think too much either. When I saw that they were going to hurt you, I was unhappy, so I just ran in.

131
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:53,300
You're just dumb.

132
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,830
It's not called being dumb,

133
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,740
it's called love.

134
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,480
What did you say?

135
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,070
I announce,

136
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:07,660
Guan Xiaotang has been in love with Li Siyu for 33 days and...

137
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:10,070
48 minutes 7 seconds!

138
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,880
You're a kid, what do you know about love?

139
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,730
I've been an adult for a while now!

140
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:17,330
I would already have a ton of wives, concubines, and kids if I were in feudal society!

141
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:20,240
You know I'm your boss, right?

142
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,120
Why can't I fancy my boss?

143
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,240
No!

144
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,560
Yes, I can! Let me tell you...

145
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,810
You hit my butt. You harassed me. If you harass me, then you have to take responsibility!

146
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:29,770
Are you sick?

147
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:33,140
If I was sick... then you're the medicine!

148
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:37,320
Who are you showing me off to?

149
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,300
Hey!

150
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,340
Hey! Li Siyu! Let me tell you!

151
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:45,000
You must face this!

152
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,400
[Noodle restaurant]

153
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,200
What's wrong with you?

154
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,400
Why didn't you hit me?

155
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,700
Seriously what's wrong with you?

156
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,000
It hurts.

157
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,200
Where?

158
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Come... Let's go to the hospital.

159
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,600
Wait, wait, wait!  Slowly!

160
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,400
Doctor, is it serious?

161
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,200
Two rib fractures, thankfully they didn't shift.

162
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,400
Are you stupid?

163
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,400
Two broken ribs and you had no idea!

164
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,800
I...

165
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,000
Many cases of fractures have mild painat the beginning. Plus, different people have different senses.

166
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
so not knowing is pretty normal.

167
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,600
Does he need to stay overnight?

168
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,800
No need. Wear a rib brace and don't exercise too much.

169
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,800
You must rest quietly. Come back to have it regularly checked.

170
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,200
In two weeks, you should be back to normal.

171
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,900
Thank you.

172
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,000
Bring this with you.

173
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,400
During this period, don't come to the office. Stay home and rest.

174
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,800
You're suddenly so nice to me now.

175
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,700
Over there.

176
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,800
Let's... well... Let's go and see what they're whispering about.

177
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,700
No, what if what they're saying is not beneficial to our company?

178
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,600
Let's look.

179
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Brother, think of another plan!

180
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,400
The hospital has urged many times. If we still don't pay the money,

181
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,600
what do we do?

182
00:13:55,400 --> 00:14:00,400
Sister-in-Law, listen to me, this is the only way now.

183
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,600
Brother, the doctor said that he's getting better now.

184
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,200
Maybe he will get out of danger in a few days.

185
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:10,200
I already borrowed what I could and even borrowed what I couldn't.

186
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,800
Right now, I just really can't think of any ways to get more money.

187
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,800
If I had any other solution, I wouldn't have thought of this idea!

188
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,800
If you don't think for yourself,

189
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,600
then can't you think of the two children at home,

190
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,800
or the four elderly?

191
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,800
Let's go.

192
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:34,210
Go.

193
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,200
A  detestable person must be pathetic as well.

194
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,470
Are you okay?

195
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,600
It's all my fault.

196
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:54,390
Sister, this has nothing to do with you.

197
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,400
I was too anxious for success.

198
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,220
No!

199
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:09,400
If they had been trained, they wouldn't have fought.

200
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:14,800
Sister, don't think about that. This has nothing to do with us.

201
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,400
If I wasn't looking for fast results...

202
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:24,700
If I could finish all the staff training....

203
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:27,600
Then this wouldn't have happened.

204
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,200
Director Su, I'll come and visit you again soon.

205
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,800
Mom's home.

206
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,700
You're home!

207
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,200
You made this?

208
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:51,500
I learned from watching videos by chefs online.

209
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,800
You never went into the kitchen in the past.

210
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,800
You work hard every day. I'm a jobless person at home.

211
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,600
I need to do some things to help you carry the burden.

212
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,600
Yuwei, come and eat dinner!

213
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:15,000
Sit down. The dishes are getting cold.

214
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,600
You don't have to do that.

215
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,600
After I went to the market I got to know

216
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,800
vegetables are so expensive now.

217
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:43,220
Our living expenses were so little,

218
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,600
but the quality of food we ate was not bad. How did you manage?

219
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,000
It's pretty simple.

220
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,600
Some vegetables are cheaper in the morning.

221
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,800
Some vegetables are 20% off after 8 P.M.

222
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,800
There are also some that can be snatched online in a certain window of time.

223
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,000
I will need to learn this.

224
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,000
Here, try this.

225
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,800
Dad, give me the fridge!

226
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,800
Which one's the fridge?

227
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,000
This one.

228
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,400
Let me take care of it.

229
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,400
You go and get some rest.

230
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,600
Yuwei, where are the clothes you wore this morning?

231
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,700
I washed them, along with your underwear. I washed them all together.

232
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,800
Daddy!

233
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,400
Tell me another story about a scientist!

234
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,300
Another scientist's story?

235
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,400
Let me read it to you.

236
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,400
No, I want Dad to read it to me.

237
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,600
He knows more scientists than you.

238
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,000
You've only been with your dad for a few days, you're already looking down on me?

239
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,500
No, I just want Dad to read it to me.

240
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:34,000
Okay, okay.  Daddy will wash the dishes first and then read to Yuwei, okay?

241
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,500
Okay!

242
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,800
Yuwei!

243
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:45,200
You can't eat this, because it has peanuts or you'll get sick.

244
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,000
Understand?

245
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Why did you buy it for her if you knew there were peanuts in there?

246
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,200
I bought this for you.

247
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,700
Later, after I wash the dishes, I'll go over to find you.

248
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,000
There's not only peanuts in here,

249
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,400
but dates, to help increase your health.

250
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,000
Is she asleep?

251
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,600
Yes.

252
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
My junior fellow at school wanted to go back to his hometown.

253
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
He wanted me to replace his position.

254
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,400
Will your body be fine?

255
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,600
I can do lab work.

256
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,250
I looked around.

257
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,600
Because the lab hasn't made any achievements all this time,

258
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:24,800
so the wage is somewhat low. It's only half of the old wage.

259
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:32,010
However, you cannot carry our family all by yourself.

260
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,600
First of all, you will collapse under the weight.

261
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:40,600
Second of all, I will not allow it.

262
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,300
Zhizhi,

263
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:51,500
through this, I've learned my lesson.

264
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,800
Rest assured.

265
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:58,200
When I get a job, I will pay you back.

266
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:03,200
I believe our family will one day be the same as before.

267
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,000
What do you think?

268
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Sister Fan.

269
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Director Li.

270
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,200
I'm going to the hospital.

271
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,400
To help that person pay their medical fees.

272
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,500
We don't have enough money to do so.

273
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,500
But if we don't pay the bill,

274
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,900
I won't be able to rest.

275
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,300
All right.

276
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:46,500
This is really cool.

277
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,600
Guan Xiaotang!

278
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,700
Your hand!

279
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,800
Come to my office.

280
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:05,200
Go! Go! Go quickly!

281
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,800
Go! Come on, Bro!

282
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,900
Good luck!

283
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,900
I won't be surnamed with Li if I don't break your ribs.

284
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:17,800
If you want to hit me, hit my butt.

285
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,800
Do you want to flirt with me like this?

286
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,900
Don't you think that we match very well?

287
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,200
Suitable, my ass!

288
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,800
I'm being sincere.

289
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:34,800
If our website didn't need you, I would fire you now!

290
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,200
I have the power of love?

291
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,300
Who you like doesn't have anything to do with me!

292
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:42,000
If you hack my computer and photoshop my photos, fuck off immediately!

293
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,700
- If you don't like it, next time I'll change... 
 - Changing it doesn't matter!

294
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,200
- I don't like you! 
 - Whether you like or hate me, it's not my problem.

295
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,200
It's enough that I like you.

296
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,100
Leave!

297
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,400
- I'm not done! 
 - Leave!

298
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,400
Come in.

299
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:48,600
Director Chen, I just received the notice. We have a meeting at 10:00.

300
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,100
It's in Director Wang's office.

301
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,700
- In Director Wang's office? 
 - Yes.

302
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:59,400
- I'll leave first. 
 - Hold on.

303
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,200
Manager Zhou also participated in the Yunling project, so ask him to go.

304
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,800
I got it.

305
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,200
Nevermind. I'll go by myself.

306
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,600
It's fine, you can leave.

307
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,000
Yes, Sir.

308
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,800
Director Chen.

309
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:46,200
- Director Wang. 
 - Director Chen.

310
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,600
You're here, Director Chen.

311
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,100
Let's start.

312
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,600
Where's Director Wang?

313
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,500
For today's meeting, Director Wang will not be taking part.

314
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:02,500
I invited you to have a meeting here is because our project has made new progress.

315
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,000
Looking at our internal affairs,

316
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,600
the "blue cloud" project pattern is in our hands.

317
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,600
Let's look at this analysis report.

318
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,500
Let's all look at page three.

319
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:20,400
This is the result of the research. It's very important.

320
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,800
It's the analysis of the customer groups.

321
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,800
We still need discussions around this project.

322
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,600
Director Chen,

323
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,500
we have to take a closer look at this.

324
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:36,400
- The analysis done is very good. 
 - Okay.

325
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,000
- Then I'm leaving first. 
 - Okay.

326
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,600
Ani,

327
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,800
- is Director Wang here today? 
 - Yes.

328
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,600
Are you looking for her?

329
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,200
No.

330
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,600
Ani,

331
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,800
I also want to know when Director Wang has time in the evening this week.

332
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,500
She's available on Wednesday and the days after.

333
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:11,400
I understand. Thank you.

334
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,400
Sister Ziru, do you have time on Thursday evening?

335
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,000
I would like to treat you to dinner.

336
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,700
Okay. But why?

337
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,700
I need you to help me figure out something.

338
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,400
Let's meet at 7:00 p.m. at the old place. That barbecue place.

339
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,000
Okay.

340
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,200
Xiaoling,

341
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:56,700
congratulations for finding a handsome and rich boyfriend.

342
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,500
What's with you again?

343
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,800
This relationship is great.

344
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,900
It's so dull.

345
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,600
Maybe you required too much?

346
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,200
I also tried to convince myself in this way.

347
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:22,600
I'm already 32 years old. I'm afraid that I can't find a person like this later.

348
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,800
I will bear this first.

349
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:29,700
By the way, I transferred my job to the sales department.

350
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,400
Sales?

351
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,600
You're working with Sister Yuan?

352
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:39,000
I was thinking about what you told me before.

353
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,400
You told me that a woman must be independent and be able to take care of herself.

354
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:50,300
Zhizhi, I have been busy with Laidianle. I haven't had time to see you.

355
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,000
Do you need my help?

356
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,800
- If you need money, I can help you. 
 - I also have some.

357
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:01,000
You've helped me a lot. I really appreciate you both.

358
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,400
I can't use your money anymore.

359
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,400
Or come to work at my company.

360
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:16,400
I have relied on you or Liu Yang all this time.

361
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:20,400
I've gone through so much.

362
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:24,200
I can't rely on someone else. I must rely on myself.

363
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:29,900
So I must start supporting myself this time.

364
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:36,000
This is not an easy way.

365
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,100
Which way is easier?

366
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:44,000
Look at you. You're a CEO now and you still have to give a good fight.

367
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:50,400
Xiaoling, you are so pretty but your boyfriend

368
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,600
won't be perfect.

369
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:58,200
If you have figured out everything, then I have 2 words for you.

370
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:01,100
- You can do it! 
 - You can do it!

371
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:04,700
No worries. I won't be defeated this time.

372
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,400
For Yuwei.

373
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,800
Here.

374
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,100
I will open the door.

375
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:26,200
Hi, Li Siyu's parcel.

376
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,800
- Mine? 
 - Such a big box.

377
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,400
What did you buy?

378
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,200
Sister Siyu, such a big box. What's this?

379
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,200
- Let me open it. 
 - What's this?

380
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,000
- What? 
 - What did you buy?

381
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,600
I didn't buy anything.

382
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,500
A box of money?

383
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,500
Did you send it to me?

384
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,100
What's this?

385
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,400
Be careful.

386
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,200
What's this?

387
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,300
There is a card.

388
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:07,300
Li Siyu, accept me!

389
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:12,100
Explain. What's going on?

390
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:15,000
Now people are so straightforward?

391
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,400
Sis, did you receive the present? Do you like it?

392
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:33,600
Guan Xiaotang, if you continue to harass me, fuck off immediately.

393
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,600
Throw it away.

394
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,400
You don't want it?

395
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:47,000
If you don't want it, I will send something else.

396
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,100
Why do you still keep it?

397
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:55,800
If you don't want it, I will take it. This is very expensive.

398
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,900
Who is this?

399
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
How young?

400
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,400
Born in 1998.

401
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,000
So young!

402
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,800
Actually, he is not that young. Did he fall for you?

403
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,600
I think he is crazy.

404
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,800
When you want to make a move, you make a big move!

405
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,600
Don't think too much. We don't have any relation.

406
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,200
Right. You should look for a reliable one.

407
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,500
Otherwise, it's a waste of time.

408
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:27,000
You should look for a man who is older than you and can take care of you.

409
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:32,900
You can also try. You are available anyway.

410
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:39,400
You want me to date a boy who can call me "aunt?"

411
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:43,200
The boy can't be married but he can warm you up.

412
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,800
You just take him as a shot of hyaluronic acid.

413
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,200
I have no words.

414
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:54,500
This means that we don't belong to the same category.

415
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:59,800
Even if we are not the same, but we can still encourage each other.

416
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,600
All right.

417
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,400
Xiaoling, come on.

418
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,800
I wish you to have hyaluronic acid forever.

419
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,800
Sister Siyu, I wish you to have a successful career.

420
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:17,000
Zhizhi, I wish you to get stronger and stronger.

421
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,700
Excuse me, I made you wait long.

422
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:26,800
Here is your beer.

423
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,700
Thank you.

424
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,200
Enjoy your food.

425
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,600
Thank you.

426
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,600
Xiao Liu, after cleaning this table, clean that table, please.

427
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,000
Waiter, where is my food?

428
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,400
Wait a sec.

429
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,800
Sister Ziru, I'm here already.

430
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,600
Don't rush. Take your time.

431
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,400
[Chen Yiming]

432
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:04,800
Don't rush. Take your time.

433
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:14,400
[Chen Yiming]

434
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,300
[Chen Yiming]

435
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,200
Hello? Ani.

436
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:04,600
This is Chen Yiming speaking. May I ask where President Wang is tonight?

437
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,800
I don't know. She doesn't have any plans tonight.

438
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:12,500
Okay. Thank you.

439
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,000
[Chen Yiming]

440
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:37,800
President Wang, Director Chen is looking for you. May I ask where you are right now?

441
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,400
Hello? Driver Wang,

442
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,600
you are at home.

443
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:06,900
Okay. Okay.

444
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,400
I get it.

445
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,400
All right. Thank you.

446
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:07,800
- Hello? 
 - Sister Ziru, are you okay?

447
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,300
I'm all right. What's up?

448
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:14,800
If you continued not answering your phone, I was going to call the police.

449
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,400
Yiming, I'm sorry.

450
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:22,000
I forgot that we had an appointment today. I'm in a meeting right now.

451
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,100
No worries. It's good to know you are all right.

452
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:32,400
There is a client waiting in my office. I probably can't make it today.

453
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,200
Shall we reschedule for another day?

454
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,400
Okay. I'm okay. Let's reschedule.

455
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,200
Okay. Let's do that. See you.

456
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:08,700
If you want talk to someone, I'm always here.

457
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,000
President Wang.

458
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,800
You just finished your work?

459
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,100
Yes, just finished.

460
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,800
I'm sorry for that day.

461
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:38,600
It's nothing.

462
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,200
How about I make it up for you today?

463
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
No need, President Wang.

464
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,600
Didn't you want me to help you with something?

465
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:59,000
It's already solved.

466
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,200
But I need you to help me today.
