00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:31,300
[To Dear Myself]

2
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,300
[Ep22]

3
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,000
That intern?

4
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:14,840
We have told you to break up with her, right?

5
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,360
I have broken up with her

6
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:19,960
Good to know

7
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,975
I have sacrificed my love and Wei

8
00:02:24,975 --> 00:02:26,319
I am back home now

9
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,080
Look at Zhang Zhizhi

10
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,560
She still makes a fuss

11
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,960
You can't just blame Zhizhi, right?

12
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,159
All blame me?

13
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:41,919
I think both of you are responsible

14
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:45,319
Liu Yang is a candide 

15
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:46,890
I didn't see this coming

16
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:50,439
I remember what you said

17
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:53,840
Every man has an asshole in his heart

18
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:57,680
I do not know

19
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,800
I do not know anything

20
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:09,225
For this family, I get up early and go to bed late

21
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,360
I don't know where I am wrong

22
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,159
I don't know where I am wrong

23
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,240
It's ok, don't cry

24
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,175
According to my experience, it's no use crying

25
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:30,280
Crying could help her relax

26
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,120
Liu Yang

27
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,991
Now it's only two of us

28
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,039
Tell me

29
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:41,759
What's your relationship with her?

30
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:43,120
I have told you

31
00:03:43,775 --> 00:03:45,599
We are clean

32
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,319
Then why did Zhizhi become like this?

33
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,159
We gave each other little gifts

34
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:11,960
So she moved your heart?

35
00:04:14,975 --> 00:04:17,839
Liu Yang is timid and conservative

36
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:19,639
Combined with his performance today

37
00:04:20,425 --> 00:04:23,650
And the cup, and scarf you mentioned

38
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,600
I think even if they fall into love with each other,

39
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,720
now it's just the beginning

40
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:28,319
No

41
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:29,600
We can't wait

42
00:04:30,575 --> 00:04:33,079
I am experienced relatively

43
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:34,800
I think, everyone should calm down

44
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:38,199
You need to figure out what to do in the future

45
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:40,240
Instead of being angry here

46
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:42,040
What's your take?

47
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:53,399
She is very simple and kind

48
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,319
Also very hard-working

49
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,360
We both come from the countryside

50
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,839
So no matter what I say

51
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:02,920
she knows everything

52
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,160
I feel relaxed when I am with her

53
00:05:09,975 --> 00:05:13,680
It's like I am back to the carefree times in college

54
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,680
But no matter how good she is

55
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,879
you are married, right?

56
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,600
As a married man, I think I did nothing wrong to my family

57
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,839
Besides house and car loans,

58
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:31,240
I need to support daughter and wife

59
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,680
I get up early and go to bed late

60
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,680
I have to please others in work

61
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,225
After going home, I need to tolerate my wife's complaints

62
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:52,502
I have to tolerate in work and at home

63
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,632
My only fault is I am not a robot

64
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,040
I'm tired, bored

65
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:08,800
Yes, it's not easy for you

66
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,525
Suddenly one day someone appeared

67
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,000
I can smile in front of her

68
00:06:27,225 --> 00:06:30,240
I can forget office politics

69
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:33,399
I can forget the boredom of the family

70
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:37,759
Yiming

71
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,519
If you were me, you wouldn't be touched?

72
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:47,680
What are you going to do?

73
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:49,519
Zhizhi

74
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:52,439
You have sacrificed yourself for so many years

75
00:06:53,675 --> 00:06:56,079
Liu Yang is going to be the director

76
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,125
If you divorce now, they will take the advantage of it

77
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,600
Zhizhi, no matter what you choose

78
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,879
we will support you

79
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,675
I won't be with Wie

80
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,850
But Zhizhi makes such a big trouble today

81
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,575
I really don't want to live with her

82
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,120
You won't divorce, right?

83
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:33,480
Zhizhi

84
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,879
Think it over

85
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,040
What kind of result you want?

86
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,600
Do you want to divorce?

87
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:01,735
If we really divorce, what about Yuwei?

88
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,525
So I and Zhizhi won't divorce

89
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:17,720
I won't divorce

90
00:08:38,174 --> 00:08:42,199
If only all of you pick me up from class every day

91
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:00,440
Goodbye, Yuwei

92
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,039
Bye bye

93
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:01,759
Bye bye

94
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:10,559
Zhizhi

95
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,039
Call me if you need help

96
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,639
Liu Yang

97
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,919
After going home, be nice to Zhizhi

98
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:24,120
Make confession or something

99
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,080
Be a good girl

100
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:00,720
Come, baby

101
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,759
Go in and play by yourself

102
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,879
Are you ok?

103
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:23,759
Fine

104
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,960
Every time Xiaoling or Zhizhi gets in trouble,

105
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,159
you will lose your mind, why?

106
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:37,679
So horrible

107
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,799
What are you afraid of?

108
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,320
I didn't do that to you

109
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,240
I'm not afraid

110
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,125
I just think we need to calm down

111
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:49,559
Especially their family affairs

112
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:52,190
If we are too radical, they will have no leeway

113
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:56,279
I'm so angry

114
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:58,600
He slapped his wife

115
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:00,000
He even betrayed her

116
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,039
It's wrong that he slapped his wife

117
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:07,655
But we don't know what's going on

118
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:11,175
I think there must be some reason

119
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:16,240
You know him so well?

120
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:19,240
No

121
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,525
I think, we have various problems as long as we are human beings

122
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:25,919
Just solve the problems

123
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,399
All will be over

124
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,559
We won't have this problem, right? 

125
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:38,720
What are you thinking about?

126
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,919
Our problem now is...

127
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,440
When will you resign?

128
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:44,919
You need to take care of your body

129
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:50,600
I need to think about it

130
00:13:58,725 --> 00:14:00,960
Now you still have the mood to surf online?

131
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,759
Well, what do you want?

132
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,360
It can't be over so easily

133
00:14:08,725 --> 00:14:10,080
I have apologized

134
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:10,960
What do you want?

135
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:13,759
You need to break up with her

136
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,720
We did

137
00:14:15,975 --> 00:14:18,240
I need you to break up with her in my presence

138
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:33,919
What are you doing?

139
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,200
Call her

140
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:36,919
No

141
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,279
I will

142
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,960
What's wrong with you?

143
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,720
Give me

144
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,879
What are you doing, Zhang Zhizhi?

145
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:45,679
Give me

146
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:47,279
No, give me the phone

147
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:50,279
Zhang Zhizhi

148
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,480
Zhang Zhizhi, open the door

149
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,080
No

150
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:56,080
Open the door

151
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:56,679
No

152
00:14:57,159 --> 00:14:57,759
Zhizhi

153
00:14:57,759 --> 00:14:59,850
Zhizhi, can we have a good talk?

154
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:00,799
Open the door

155
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:01,639
No

156
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:03,320
I am going to break in now

157
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,240
Hello, brother Yang

158
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:07,700
Are you ok?

159
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:09,279
Stop harassing Liu Yang

160
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,759
Leave him alone

161
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,519
Are you crazy?

162
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:25,159
I can tell you

163
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,320
You can't call my mom

164
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:29,879
I will go to your office

165
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:33,480
I will let them know she is a bitch

166
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,960
She can't work there anymore

167
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,919
If you go there, we will divorce, I can guarantee you

168
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:40,559
You threaten me

169
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:42,720
You dare to threaten me

170
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,039
This is my bottom line

171
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,639
You have a bottom line?

172
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:49,399
What do you want?

173
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,840
Put it down

174
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,120
Are you crazy?

175
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,679
You bastard

176
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,399
You bastard

177
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,399
Bastard

178
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,519
Bastard

179
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:52,559
Stop crying

180
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:54,000
It's ok...

181
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:01,799
Hello, mom

182
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:03,279
Hello, Zhizhi

183
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:06,559
You called me just now?

184
00:17:06,974 --> 00:17:08,934
No, I called the wrong number

185
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:12,440
Are you ok?

186
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:15,359
I'm fine, mom

187
00:17:16,358 --> 00:17:17,598
How are you doing?

188
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,680
I'm fine

189
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,650
After coming back, the fresh water 

190
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:25,079
and clean air are good for my health

191
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:27,799
Ok, that's all

192
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:28,920
I'm going to dance now

193
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,839
Brother Yang, are you there?

194
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,279
Sister-in-law called and scolded me

195
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:00,240
It's ok

196
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:01,759
For you I don't care

197
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:04,250
I am not afraid even if the whole world scolds me

198
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:07,160
I haven't finished the medicine you bought for me

199
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:10,160
Your words are still lingering in my ear

200
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,850
I can still feel your kiss 

201
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,640
Brother Yang

202
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:19,039
Even if we can't be together

203
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,039
I will never forget the love you give me

204
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,279
She keeps jumping

205
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,119
Just like the witch said

206
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,075
Every step she jumps is like 

207
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:29,920
walking on the tip of a knife

208
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,119
Mom

209
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:33,480
Isn't the little mermaid afraid of pain?

210
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,279
Everyone is afraid of pain

211
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,759
But if you love someone

212
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:41,319
you will not be afraid of pain

213
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:44,880
you will feel more painful

214
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,880
Dad is back

215
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:20,799
It's our neighbor

216
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:33,575
But she is willing to endure pain

217
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,279
She wants to stay by prince's side even if she walks like a bubble

218
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,181
You want to chase me away?

219
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,880
I don't want to see you again

220
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:37,400
I move out

221
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:28,000
Dad

222
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Dad

223
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:40,599
Aunts

224
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:41,799
Good girl

225
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,559
Yuwei is so great

226
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:45,599
Yuwei

227
00:24:47,375 --> 00:24:49,519
Let me see, you are more beautiful now

228
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,680
So lovely

229
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,200
Look, what I have brought you

230
00:24:55,759 --> 00:24:56,519
Like it?

231
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:58,759
And nuts

232
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,359
You will get smarter after you eat them

233
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:01,519
No peanuts

234
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,160
And your favorite

235
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,480
What is it?

236
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:08,519
Like it?

237
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:09,279
Yes

238
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,720
Take it

239
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:13,079
Here, can you take it all?

240
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,759
Yes

241
00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:16,279
Go to play

242
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:24,680
What happened?

243
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:28,200
He refused to apologize to me

244
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,960
Refused to break up with her

245
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,519
And they are still in contact

246
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,000
Asshole

247
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,319
But you kicked him out

248
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:39,400
So stupid you are

249
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:43,175
Why?

250
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:48,675
If that woman really steps in, it's too late to regret

251
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:51,440
Mom

252
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,079
Yeah

253
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:01,799
What?

254
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,160
Why do you pull me?

255
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,079
My new clothes

256
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:05,880
It's very expensive

257
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:09,359
Why do you always persuade her to make up?

258
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,880
She can't decide for herself?

259
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,160
Li Siyu

260
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,000
Can you stop thinking in your perspective?

261
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,839
Zhizhi is not you

262
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:17,680
Not me, either

263
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,759
This family is her life

264
00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:20,119
She can't live without it

265
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:21,720
Zhizhi was very independent in childhood

266
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,150
She becomes like this after she marries Liu Yang

267
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,640
So you can get her back to her childhood?

268
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,440
She doesn't need to rely on him

269
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:29,039
Maybe it's a good option to divorce him

270
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:30,319
What about the kid?

271
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,720
I can help her

272
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,119
Don't be whimsical

273
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:34,359
You think you can?

274
00:26:34,675 --> 00:26:36,759
You let Yuwei have box lunch or order takeaway with you?

275
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:19,200
Zhizhi, do you want to divorce Liu Yang?

276
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,119
I don't know

277
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,650
If you don't want to divorce, you should call him back

278
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,375
Siyu slapped him for you

279
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,050
I believe he won't hurt you anymore

280
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:46,225
Yiming tells me, before you find this out, they have broken up

281
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:51,725
I saw that woman wechat him again

282
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,839
Stop thinking about this now

283
00:27:54,175 --> 00:27:56,680
Just ask yourself if you want to live with Liu Yang

284
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,079
To tell the truth

285
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:04,200
You have never seen the world

286
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:07,700
Liu Yang is just a rookie

287
00:28:08,475 --> 00:28:10,950
If you want to live with Liu Yang

288
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,350
you should stop now and it's a lesson for him

289
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,125
If you really don't want to live with him, 

290
00:28:19,125 --> 00:28:21,125
you should make your decision

291
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:30,559
Sister Siyu

292
00:28:31,975 --> 00:28:35,119
Should I forgive him?

293
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:47,119
You have Yuwei

294
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:59,900
You need to think over what kind of life you want

295
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:04,250
If you want a happy family

296
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:08,960
you should let bygones be bygones

297
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:21,240
We have persuaded them

298
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:22,559
Why did they live apart?

299
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:24,559
You should ask Liu Yang

300
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,325
Actually Liu Yang is not a bad guy

301
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:33,225
He is just too tired

302
00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:35,799
You think he is not bad after this?

303
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:37,720
To be fair

304
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:41,160
Zhizhi didn't save face for Liu Yang

305
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,880
So in your view, what Zhizhi should do?

306
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:46,839
She should understand him?

307
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,200
Forgive his affair?

308
00:29:48,759 --> 00:29:50,160
Even she needs to reflect herself?

309
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:55,839
Forget it

310
00:29:56,519 --> 00:29:57,359
You are a patient

311
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,440
We are done talking

312
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,700
Liu Yang bullies Zhizhi so

313
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:20,039
Zhizhi still doesn't get a divorce, why?

314
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:21,079
Why?

315
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:23,079
Because the family can't do without Liu Yang 

316
00:30:23,079 --> 00:30:24,800
Zhizhi and Yuwei can't live without Liu Yang

317
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,079
What do you want to say on earth?

318
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,711
I want to say 

319
00:30:29,825 --> 00:30:32,720
You want me to resign

320
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,400
Did I say like that?

321
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:40,279
Did I mention resign?

322
00:30:40,725 --> 00:30:42,920
You mean it, I just know it

323
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,480
Chen Yiming, let me tell you

324
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:48,350
I am afraid one day I will encounter the same thing like Zhizhi

325
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:49,759
I am not Liu Yang

326
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,160
But you are also a man

327
00:30:52,039 --> 00:30:54,350
You can't think I am like him just because I am a man

328
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:56,240
No one can guarantee this

329
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,480
Yes, it cannot be guaranteed

330
00:30:58,599 --> 00:30:59,839
But that is the future

331
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:00,920
I'm talking about the present

332
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,279
The present is the beginning of the future

333
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:05,640
I must have my own business

334
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,675
I want to be independent

335
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:31,559
I know

336
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,839
You wish me good

337
00:31:36,175 --> 00:31:40,599
But if you really consider for me

338
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:42,920
stop talking about it

339
00:31:49,025 --> 00:31:52,559
I won't want to talk about marriage before Lubao's equity financing 

340
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:02,000
Bye

341
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,239
Waiter

342
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,079
More beer

343
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:11,920
Ok

344
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:13,480
Right away

345
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,119
President Wang

346
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:31,920
I saw you over there

347
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:32,880
It's really you

348
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,079
Why are you here?

349
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,039
Sit...

350
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:36,079
President Wang, sit down

351
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,518
Why are you here alone?

352
00:34:40,518 --> 00:34:41,198
Where is Siyu?

353
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:44,039
Siyu, she works overtime

354
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,440
Overtime again?

355
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:45,920
Correct

356
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,679
Pan Zhiyong

357
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,320
Siyu is such a good employee

358
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,119
President Wang, have some skewers

359
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,519
Ok

360
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:57,880
I didn't eat lunch and dinner, yet

361
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,679
Really?

362
00:35:01,825 --> 00:35:02,861
Your beer  -Ok, thank you

363
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:03,679
It's great

364
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:04,679
Really?

365
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:05,920
Dude

366
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,000
Help me heat this up

367
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,480
And I need more skewers

368
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:09,480
Ok, no problem

369
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:10,239
Thank you

370
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:11,159
Wait a moment, you're welcome

371
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,559
It's cold?

372
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:13,280
Don't eat it

373
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:13,760
Ok

374
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:15,360
Eat the hot skewers

375
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,559
Want some beer?

376
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:24,280
Ok

377
00:35:26,519 --> 00:35:27,800
I have good wine in my car

378
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,400
It's better with skewers

379
00:35:29,719 --> 00:35:30,440
Great

380
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:33,960
Waiter

381
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,320
Two more cups

382
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,119
Ok

383
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:45,679
Wang

384
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,079
Bring a bottle of wine here

385
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,119
From the car

386
00:35:49,239 --> 00:35:49,800
Your cup

387
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,400
Open it

388
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,039
I don't need cups

389
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:54,800
Ok

390
00:35:57,079 --> 00:35:57,760
Thank you  -Have a good appetite

391
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,400
You're welcome

392
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:02,440
Smells good

393
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:05,440
Just give it to me

394
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,079
Thank you

395
00:36:09,719 --> 00:36:10,519
Wait a moment

396
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:22,119
Tell me if it's enough

397
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,519
Enough...

398
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:24,760
Thank you

399
00:36:35,425 --> 00:36:38,559
To coincidence

400
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:39,719
To coincidence

401
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,199
Do you like the wine?

402
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:47,800
Yeah

403
00:36:48,875 --> 00:36:51,679
It has a different flavor

404
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:55,760
What kind of wine is this?

405
00:36:58,079 --> 00:36:59,360
Not important

406
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:00,920
The important thing is

407
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,559
The mood

408
00:37:04,025 --> 00:37:06,159
You have a good mood today

409
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,320
Outside the company

410
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,119
Just call me sister Ziru

411
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,119
Sister Ziru

412
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:22,925
Why are you drinking here alone?

413
00:37:24,519 --> 00:37:25,000
Yeah

414
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,519
Quarreled with Siyu again?

415
00:37:31,639 --> 00:37:32,559
No

416
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:39,400
We just have different views

417
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,440
So serious?

418
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:44,679
What's the matter?

419
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,159
Two days ago

420
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:53,119
She fainted suddenly

421
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,559
I sent her to the hospital

422
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,360
Then she went to do the checkup in the hospital

423
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:00,440
According to the medical report, 

424
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,760
her body indicators are higher than the standards

425
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:03,639
I persuaded her to have some rest

426
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:09,075
But she thinks I am trying to force her to resign

427
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,239
Actually, I didn't mean that

428
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,760
But she antagonizes me

429
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:16,159
Resignation is a big deal

430
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:18,725
Yes, but I

431
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:21,079
I didn't mean to force her to resign

432
00:38:21,639 --> 00:38:23,639
I think she should take some rest first

433
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,519
After recuperating

434
00:38:26,519 --> 00:38:27,920
she can go back to work

435
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:28,679
Right?

436
00:38:28,679 --> 00:38:30,800
But she just can't understand me

437
00:38:33,159 --> 00:38:35,039
Sister Ziru, I really...

438
00:38:36,925 --> 00:38:39,519
I really don't understand

439
00:38:40,675 --> 00:38:44,475
I find, the longer we stay together, 

440
00:38:44,475 --> 00:38:46,701
the less we understand each other

441
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,280
According to my experience

442
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,159
It's easy to accept someone

443
00:38:56,519 --> 00:38:58,440
But mutual understanding is difficult

444
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:02,719
Let alone the new lovers,

445
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:10,425
It's hard to imagine that the couple can understand each other

446
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:15,280
Sister Ziru

447
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:21,550
You mean, I should let it go

448
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:28,675
I mean you still need to have more understandings

449
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,559
Understanding?

450
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:32,239
Yes

451
00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:34,400
Of course

452
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,320
Understanding is the hardest

453
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,920
Sister Ziru, I...

454
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,920
With all due respect

455
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,880
I just want to ask

456
00:39:48,425 --> 00:39:54,280
Why women are so competitive?

457
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,360
Not necessarily

458
00:39:57,559 --> 00:39:58,719
It depends

459
00:39:59,079 --> 00:40:00,079
Yes...

460
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:09,575
Previously, I thought she was generous, resilient and responsible 

461
00:40:10,675 --> 00:40:12,639
She is very independent

462
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,159
She is so good in every way

463
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:21,300
But now I feel she can't be so emulative in every way

464
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,519
Especially in life

465
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:25,719
She can't have only career, right?

466
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:37,480
I am the woman who has only career

467
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,159
No, sister Ziru, I...

468
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,039
Yiming

469
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:45,840
You are right

470
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,559
We can't just have a career

471
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,320
Just like the way I came just now

472
00:40:58,719 --> 00:41:00,119
Actually I am lonely

473
00:41:03,825 --> 00:41:08,064
I feel everything is boring

474
00:41:13,159 --> 00:41:15,725
I feel suffocated, surrounded by loneliness

475
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,320
I feel so desperate

476
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:29,760
Actually I saw your Moment

477
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:32,400
I know you are alone

478
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,719
So I came

479
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,280
Because I'm afraid

480
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,679
I'm afraid I'm alone tonight again

481
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:46,840
See a movie alone

482
00:41:49,719 --> 00:41:54,950
In their stories, cry and smile

483
00:41:57,559 --> 00:41:58,920
And then go home alone

484
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,519
It's a long night again

485
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,559
Sister Ziru

486
00:42:16,125 --> 00:42:21,050
If you need someome to talk to in the future

487
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,679
you can tell me

488
00:42:25,719 --> 00:42:26,519
I will be there

489
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:34,679
Hello

490
00:43:36,719 --> 00:43:37,440
Where are you now?

491
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:03,719
Siyu

492
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:09,800
If you don't want to resign

493
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:11,679
So be it

494
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,639
But I only have one request

495
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,760
Just don't be too tired, don't push yourself so hard

496
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,159
Don't ruin your health

497
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,519
If you don't want to get married now

498
00:44:30,679 --> 00:44:31,440
It's up to you

499
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,079
But I still only have one request

500
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:48,375
If you want to get married, I must be your groom

501
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:01,679
Yiming

502
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:10,800
Siyu

503
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:18,325
I will try my best to think from your perspective

504
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:22,639
I will try my best to understand you

505
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:25,880
I will work hard

506
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:27,880
I will work harder

507
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:34,300
Until you have no concerns about the future
