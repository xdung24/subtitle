Excuse me. Let me pass.

 - Hurry.

Kneel... and then give the flowers.

23
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:50,270
Yes, I will.

24
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:53,490
What are you doing? Where's the ring? When will I give it to Siyu?

25
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:56,290
In a bit, I'll put the ring in the drone. The drone will bring it to you.

26
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:59,330
- Then drone will bring it to me? 
 - Yes, yes take a look.

27
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:03,040
Everyone! Rest for a bit where you are now.

28
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,190
I have already looked at all the material about Zhang Yanzhou.

29
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,820
He values credibility and loyalty

30
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,820
but likes money as well, so I think we still have a chance.

31
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,290
You must get the ¥5,000,000 order back.

32
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:14,210
I'll try my best.

00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:16,660
 [Yiming] 

34
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:21,600
Sister Yuan, who do you think leaked the price to Qiji?

35
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,440
I'm looking into it, too. I am not sure right now.

36
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,300
Find out who it was.

37
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,780
I'll definitely beat him up until he regrets living.

38
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,680
Don't worry. I'm more ruthless than you.

39
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,790
Just close the deal with Qiji and I'll treat you to a spa day when you get back.

40
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:38,210
Sister, they won't let us in because we don't have an appointment.

41
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,140
Sister, Feiyu's people just went in.

42
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,660
Sorry, you cannot enter without an appointment.

43
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:47,100
Hello, I'm from Beijing Feiyu Batteries. I have a meeting with Director Zhang of Qiji Group at 2:00 p.m.

44
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:50,450
- What should we do? 
 - We still have 15 minutes.

45
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:52,480
Give me all the materials.

46
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,680
[Yiming] 

47
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:00,490
 Hello, the number you called is currently busy. 

48
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:05,950
Hello, I'm from Beijing Feiyu Batteries. I have a meeting with Director Zhang at 2:00 p.m.

49
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,860
I believe two of my colleagues have already arrived.

50
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,290
- Yes, that's right. Please come in. 
 - Thank you.

51
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:16,870
-  Can you help us just this one time? Please.  
  -  Sorry, I really can't. 

52
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,840
- Learn Piano! 
 - Okay.

53
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,520
 The subscriber you dialed cannot be connected right now. 

54
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,540
Sorry, the subscriber you dialed cannot be connected. 

55

 [Yiming] 

56
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,840
- Can I help you? 
 - I'm looking for Director Zhang.

57
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,940
- You are...? 
 - I'm from Feiyu.

58
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:06,030
Didn't we ask you to wait in the reception room?

59
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:09,080
Director Zhang went to the bathroom. He will be back soon.

60
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,660
- Thank you. 
 - Please wait a moment.

61
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,530
 I think this is pretty good.

62
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:27,240
Brother Yiming, where is Sister Siyu?

63
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,360
- I don't know. 
 - You don't know?

64
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,690
She went to the office around noon saying she had work and hasn't been answering my phone calls since then.

65
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:36,210
Such an important day, why didn't you have her take the day off?

66
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:38,220
I wanted to give her a surprise, right?

67
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,480
So I didn't give her any hints.

68
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,490
 [Gu Xiaoling: I'm on the subway.]  
 Haowen.

69
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:50,130
- What's up? 
 - Siyu's younger sister is at the subway station. Go help me pick her up.

70
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:53,790
Send her WeChat to me. I'm the best at picking up pretty women.

71
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:55,890
What else?

72
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:57,800
Don't mess around.

73
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,270
Well that depends on whether she's pretty or not.

74
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:02,080
Don't worry.

75
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:19,410
Thank you.

76
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:02,280
Hey, did you go to the wrong place?

77
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,730
No, I didn't. I'm looking for you. Hello, Director Zhang.

78
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,900
You are?

79
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:11,640
I'm Li Siyu, the sales manager of Lubao Batteries.

80
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,590
Qiji and Lubao have already ended their contract.

81
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:21,980
If you have any questions, you can contact the Legal Department.

82
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,410
Please give me 15 minutes, Director Zhang.

83
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,440
Thank you.

84
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:32,950
I can. Go make an appointment with my secretary.

85
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:37,220
If I was able to get an appointment, then I wouldn't be here blocking you.

86
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,870
Get out of my way.

87
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:53,650
Director Zhang, with Qiji electric vehicle's rate of sales and profit margin,

88
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:55,740
you can probably earn around ¥2,000 a minute.

89
00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:00,070
But if you give me 15 minutes, I promise I'll help you make ¥50,000,00 more.

90
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:06,210
Listen here.

91
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:09,330
I won't do any more business with Lubao.

92
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:13,040
Maybe you'll change your mind in 15 minutes.

93
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,940
I'm calling security.

94
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,310
Once security gets the call, they'll have to come up from the first floor,

95
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:30,560
break this door open, and drag me out. It'll take at least 10 minutes.

96
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,390
That's fine, too.

97
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:35,240
Director Zhang, let's get straight to the point.

98
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,290
I never discuss business in the bathroom.

99
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,920
Then let's go to your office and talk.

100
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:58,500
Baby, what are you up to?

101
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,900
Remember to eat on time.

102
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,560
Baby, do you miss me?

103
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,540
Don't be angry. You'll get wrinkles.

104
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:10,390
Let me tell you. I discovered a really good restaurant.

105
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:12,380
Goddess...

106
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,900
Of course, I love you the most.

107
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:20,390
I'm in a meeting right now. I'll go look for you later.

108
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:24,860
Be good. I'm hanging up now. Bye-bye.

109
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:35,700
Yiming, I have no words to describe your sister-in-law's looks.

110
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,930
She doesn't look like Li Siyu at all.

111
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,930
Their parents remarried, they have a different mother and father.

112
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:43,880
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

113
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,230
I thought Li Siyu's little sister

114
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:48,630
would be a 7 out of 10 in terms of looks.

115
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:50,460
Whatever, whatever.

116
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:53,320
I rented a sports car for nothing.

117
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,280
Don't even think about hitting on her.

118
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,850
Otherwise, I wouldn't know how to explain it to Li Siyu.

119
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:01,860
Don't worry, I wouldn't want it even if it were free.

120
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,610
Oh! Warning.

121
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,520
I'll talk to you later. Your bro might experience something

122
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,980
with a goddess.

123
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,500
You...

124
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,400
- Hello? 
 - Hello—

125
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,300
Xiaoling?

126
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:05,100
You have 15 minutes. The countdown starts now.

127
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,000
Director Zhang, Yunhai's contract price was higher than yours by 1%.

128
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,900
The final execution price is 5% lower than ours.

129
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,200
This is our sales team's tradition.

130
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,000
For first-time customers, we give them all the sales commission as a thank you.

131
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,200
- We also did that when we signed the contract with Qili back then. 
  - I don't care.

132
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,600
Giving my competitor a lower price means being on bad terms with me.

133
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,650
This shipment of batteries has only 200,000 in total.

134
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:32,000
When it comes to both parties' cost and pricing,

135
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
there's basically no impact.

136
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,200
But this has hurt my trust in you guys!

137
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,400
This is our negligence. Before we signed with Yunhai, we should've

138
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,200
- notified you first. 
 - Enough, enough. Stop talking.

139
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,600
It's already too late to apologize.

140
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,160
Director Zhang, if we move up the delivery time,

141
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,800
can that make up for it?

142
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,900
I don't accept it.

143
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:00,100
Director Zhang, what if I listed you as a priority client for this product?

144
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,700
Sit back. My car is powerful. It can accelerate to 100 kph in 3.2 seconds.

145
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:13,800
It's been a long time since I drove this car. I always keep it at the club.

146
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,600
Actually, it's not like I can't keep it at home since it's a villa in the city.

147
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,800
You should know... The garage is small though, it can only fit three cars.

148
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,200
So I just switch off between those three cars.

149
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,600
[If you keep ignoring me, aren't you afraid that I'll run away with someone else?]

150

Turn on the air conditioning.

151
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,700
I really don't use this car very often.

[Brand New Product - Lubao 3rd Generation]

153
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,100
Lubao 3.0?

154
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,200
Lubao 3.0 not only can be produced ahead of schedule

155
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:25,100
but also outperforms all other batteries on the market.

156
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,400
Did you guys finally succeed in your research?

157
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,200
If you are the first to install Lubao 3.0

158
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,400
then the output value of Qiji's whole product line could increase by at least ¥50,000,000 next year.

159
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,300
- Price? 
 - We will definitely offer you the lowest price.

160
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,100
What about Yunhai Group?

161

Lubao 3.0's product line is newly developed.

162
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,000
The first three months' production capacity is only ¥10,000,000.

163
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,300
If Director Zhang places a ¥10,000,000 order,

164
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,600
then we won't be able to supply Lubao 3.0 to any other companies.

165
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,000
You not only want to get back that ¥5,000,000 order

166
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,400
- but also want me to place a ¥10,000,000 order? 
 - Yes.

167
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,200
Time's up. You can leave now.

168
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,000
Director Zhang...

169
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,200
Thank you, Director Zhang.

170
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,800
Sister Siyu, how did it go?

171
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,600
I didn't get the deal.

172
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:28,200
- Are you okay? 
 - Sister, hurry and sit.

173
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,800
I'm fine, just let me relax for 30 seconds.

174
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,200
- Xiao Tian, book me a ticket for the earliest flight to Guangzhou. 
 - Got it.

175
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,050
Xiao Jia, contact Yunhai Group's Purchasing Department.

176
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:48,000
Tell them that I need to see them as soon as possible.

177
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,700
Manager Li.

178
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,500
Director Zhang wants you to stay behind to discuss a few things.

179
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,400
 Li Siyu's wedding ring. 

180
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,800
 This is way too small. 

181
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,600
Xiaoling.

182
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,600
Rest for a bit. I'll go take a look.

183
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,200
- What's going on? 
 - I don't know!

184
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,000
What happened?

185
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,300
- What's the problem? 
 - I'm not sure.

186
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,800
Hubby, go take a look.

187
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,200
Hello, can you help me hold this for a bit?

188
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,600
Come on.

189
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,500
How long will it take you to fix it?

190
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,200
I'm also not too sure about that. Let me take a look.

191
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,800
How come you don't know anything? Can you fix it or not?

192
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,800
He's proposing today. It's his whole life's happiness on the line!

193
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,300
This is also my first time encountering this problem.

194
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,500
Quickly take a look!

195
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,000
Have you tested the endurance system?

196
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,600
No.

197
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,200
Check the endurance first, and if there are no issues with that then check the operating system of the platform.

198
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,800
If the platform is fine then there must be an error in the interactive system.

199
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,000
There's indeed an error in the interactive system.

200
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,400
Can you fix it in 30 minutes?

201
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,660
- I'll need at least 3 hours. 
 - Three hours?!

202
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,700
The sky will be dark!

203
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,800
Do you know why I'm against Yunhai?

204
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,600
Because Yunhai's two largest shareholders used to work for you.

205
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,400
When they left, they used unethical methods

206
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,200
to steal your core technologies at that time.

207
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,600
I have a batch of defective batteries.

208
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,500
Not many, just 100,000.

209
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:38,400
I hope that Lubao Group can help me transfer it to them.

210
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:43,000
If you get it done, then I'll personally give you ¥1,000,000 as a reward.

211
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,600
Director Zhang...

212
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:51,990
I'll give you one minute to think about it.

213
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,400
Director Zhang.

214
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,600
I've always admired you.

215
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,100
But it's not because Qiji Group's performances repeatedly hit new high records,

216
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:14,600
nor is it because of your place on the list of wealthy people.

217
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,460
It's because you've said before

218
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:19,400
that you want to create conscientious electric cars.

219
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,000
And I've always used that as motivation.

220
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,800
I want to be a conscientious salesperson

221
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,780
Well said.

222
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:34,200
A conscientious salesperson.

223
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,200
Have Director Liu meet with Feiyu's people.

224
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,200
Also, tell the heads of each department to come to my office.

225
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,400
Also, ask Manager Liu from the contract department to come.

226
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,200
No problem.

227
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:52,400
I'll continue with the ¥5,000,000 order from before.

228
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,000
In addition, I'll place another ¥10,000,000 order.

229
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:05,000
Brother Yiming, she's in Wuxi right now.

230
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,100
Wuxi?

231
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,420
Our company had a client suddenly cancel an order.

232
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,900
The company sent her to fix it.

233
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,400
Then will she be back in time?

234
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,200
According to what I know,

235
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,100
they will arrive at Hongqiao airport at 4:44 p.m.

236
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,000
Manager Li, why don't you eat before heading back?

237
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,600
Thanks, but my boyfriend is waiting for me.

238
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,000
Okay, then I won't keep you any longer.

239
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:44,100
But there's one thing I'm very curious about.

240
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,600
If I had rejected you just now, then what would you have done next?

241
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,900
Before your secretary came out,

242
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,200
I was booking a ticket to Guangzhou.

243
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,400
- To go to Yunhai Group? 
 - Yes.

244
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,900
- To sell the batteries that I canceled on to them? 
 - Yes.

245
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,200
But according to what I know, their purchasing plan for this year is already done.

246
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,000
I had to try, right?

247
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,800
After all, Lubao's quality is well-known.

248
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:11,000
In addition, we have your 10% cancellation fee.

249
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,200
If I offer that to them,

250
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,000
I feel that they would be interested.

251
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:22,200
Manager Li, have you considered changing your environment?

252
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,200
What you mean is...?

253
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,800
Come to Qiji.

254
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,200
Both the position and salary will definitely make you satisfied.

255
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,200
Do you want to switch to sell electric cars?

256
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,400
Yes. You're a very talented, outstanding salesperson.

257
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,600
Thank you for the praise, Director Zhang.

258
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,200
But... you're too greedy!

259
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,200
You just bought ¥15,000,000 of our batteries.

260
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,600
Do you want to poach the sales manager as well?

261
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,800
How about it? Think about it.

262
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,200
How about this? Once you've bought ¥200,000,000,

263
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,300
we can then talk about my indenture contract.

264
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,000
Okay, it's a deal!

265
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,800
It's a deal!

266
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:16,000
Oh no, something big happened.

267
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:22,800
I'm sorry, I was discussing some things with a client just now.

268
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:26,700
- Are you done? 
 - I'm done. Did you need something?

269
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:30,120
Yes, something very important.

270
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,200
But it's all been delayed.

271
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,810
Where are you? I'll go find you.

272
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,400
We'll talk later.

273
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,400
- Does your stomach hurt again? Do you want to take some medicine? 
 - Yes.

274
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,800
Sister, are you okay?

275
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,800
I'm fine.

276
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,900
Sister Siyu, I really admire you!

277
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,300
You really turned the tables!

278
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:07,990
Honestly, in our sales department,

279
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,600
whether it's talent, character, or work ethic,

280
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,460
if you were placed second,

281
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,800
then no one would dare to place first.

282
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,470
Where did you just place Sister Yuan?

283
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:21,270
Don't say nonsense.

284
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,700
I didn't think.

285
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,700
But Sister Yuan has been in charge of the sales department for more than half a year,

286
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:33,000
yet hasn't been officially appointed.

287
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
What's the situation?

288
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
You guys, stop thinking so much.

289
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,200
Sister Yuan becoming director will happen sooner or later.

290
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,000
That's right.

291
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:30,170
- Sister Siyu, we'll leave first. 
 - Sister Siyu, see you tomorrow.

292
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,460
Sorry, I wasn't purposefully ignoring your calls.

293
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,430
My phone was muted.

294
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:52,600
You know that there can't be an interruption in the mood when discussing business with a client.

295
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,860
As soon as I was finished, I gave you a call back.

296
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:17,060
Wow, all of my favorites.

297
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,770
Yiming,

298
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:22,180
how are you this caring?

299
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:36,720
- You are using a Ubuntu 15.04? 
 - That's right.

300
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,240
Delete the upgraded system and reinstall it. It'll only take forty minutes.

301
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,920
- Will that work? 
 - Try it.

302
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:47,820
Fine. If there's any other problem, don't blame me.

303
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,180
All right, you seem to know a thing or two.

304
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:02,770
It's just basic UAV knowledge.

305
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:04,660
What "AV"?

306
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:07,740
UAV.

307
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:11,780
"UAV."

308
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:22,810
 Everything is ready, just waiting on the female lead. 
 OK. 

309
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,390
Since you treat me so well, how do I repay you?

310
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:39,500
- Tell me, I'll agree to anything. 
 - Hey, hey.

311
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:42,050
I'm driving. Sit properly.

312
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:46,560
Let's go. Let's go home right now.

313
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,230
We can't. I've already prepared everything.

314
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:52,230
What did you prepare?

315
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:54,030
To go see a movie.

316
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:58,220
"To go see a movie"? A movie with a 5:00 p.m. showtime?

317
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:03,520
This movie has a limited showtime.

318
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,960
It'd be a shame if you miss it.

319
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,960
Okay!

320
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,560
Are you in a better mood now?

321
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:27,300
No. You played with my feelings.

322
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,860
Your phone was not muted.

323
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:34,900
It was busy the first time I called, and then you didn't pick up any of my other calls.

324
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,760
I was on the phone with Sister Yuan.

325
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:40,330
Even if you were on the phone with Sister Yuan, shouldn't you at least pause for a moment to tell me?

326
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:42,540
I was almost done talking to her.

327
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,970
You didn't call me back after you finished talking to her.

328
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:48,990
Didn't I tell you? I only had 15 minutes to talk with my client.

329
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:52,360
Oh, it was that intense? I thought you were clearing mines or something.

330
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,180
Believe whatever you want.

331
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,290
It's not that I don't believe you.

332
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:00,750
It just made me feel uncomfortable.

333
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:03,230
One moment the call went through,

334
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:05,150
the next moment you ended it.

335
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:08,450
When I called again, you ended it. There was even a busy signal once.

336
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,360
What are you trying to say?

337
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,330
I'm not trying to say anything.

338
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:17,790
It was just weird to me, and I was worried.

339
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,700
Was it weird or were you worried?

340
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,650
Worried.

341
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:26,990
I've told you many times,

342
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:30,850
I'm not a little kid. If I really ran into a bad guy, I'd know how to handle it.

343
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:33,130
What's there to be worried about?

344
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:37,610
Let's not be angry anymore. I was wrong, okay?

345
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:40,790
I should have given you a reply on WeChat.

346
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:44,170
Don't worry about me anymore.

347
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:46,710
I'll remember to reply to your WeChat messages from now on.

348
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:54,310
Let me tell you, I wasn't just worried.

349
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:57,910
I thought it was strange, too. What was going on?

350
00:27:57,910 --> 00:28:01,970
I had prepared everything already. Then, without a word, you went on a business trip.

351
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:05,760
You even went to Wuxi! Not only did you not pick up my calls, but you even hung up on me.

352
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,610
Yiming, are you done yet?

353
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:12,340
What do you mean by "are you done yet"?

354
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:23,420
You always work overtime endlessly to accompany customers.

355
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:25,260
Your body can't stand it, either.

356
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,670
Aren't you just saying that you want me to quit?

357
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:32,010
Don't excite me. It's possible. My income right now is enough to take care of you.

358
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:34,450
I can take care of myself. Why do I have to depend on you?

359
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:37,030
Then you can at least get a less strenuous job, can't you?

360
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:39,520
- That's enough. 
 - Did I say anything wrong?

361
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:43,190
There's no wrong or right here. It isn't that you're worried about me, it's that you don't believe in me.

362
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:48,110
Are you just putting words in my mouth right now? From beginning to end, have I said anything about not believing in you?

363
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:52,370
Stop the car. Stop the car! I'm telling you to stop the car.

364
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:01,270
Siyu. Siyu! Siyu!

365
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,910
What's wrong with you?

366
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:27,080
- Why are you throwing a tantrum? 
 - I'm tired.

367
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,220
I want to go home and rest.

368
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:34,460
The— We haven't watched the movie yet.

369
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:36,400
I'm not in the mood today.

370
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:44,580
Sister Siyu, Xiaoling got into a fight with someone.

371
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:49,600
-  Stop fighting. Stop fighting. 
 - Xiaoling!

372
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:56,160
Stop fighting! 
  - Xiaoling! Xiaoling!

373
00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:02,320
- You dare lie to me! 
 - Are you crazy!?

374
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,380
What are you doing?!

375
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:11,300
Xiaoling was bored waiting

376
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:15,930
so she asked the operator to teach her how to use the drone. The result is

377
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:18,600
that she saw this.

378
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:22,840
I can't tell if there if he lost control or if it was deliberate,

379
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:27,170
but the drone smashed Lan Ke's car.

380
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:31,180
Then Lan Ke's car hit the elder sister's car.

381
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:37,010
Xiaoling, Lisa, and Lan Ke started fighting.

382
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,070
Let me answer this call.

383
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:45,720
Hello?

384
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:52,390
This was supposed to be Brother Yiming's surprise proposal for you.

385
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:54,560
It was so romantic.

386
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:00,660
Zhizhi.

387
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:08,860
If you have other things to do, you can leave first.

388
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:12,530
It's fine. I'll wait here so that there's someone to take care of them.

389
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:16,360
Liu Yang, you guys head out first. I'll go find you later.

390
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:19,210
Okay.

391
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:35,360
Okay, I understand. Thanks.

392
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,770
Siyu.

393
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:46,100
Lawyer Liu called me back. It's best if we settle this in private.

394
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:48,550
But Lan Ke hit Xiaoling and pushed Zhizhi.

395
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:51,960
Didn’t Xiaoling throw the first punch?

396
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:55,850
How is it? Have you all thought about it? Will you accept mediation?

397
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:04,830
We're willing.

398
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:08,400
I got beaten up like this for no reason. I don't accept!

399
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:11,680
- If you didn't get involved, would I have hit you? 
 - Xiaoling!

400
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,660
We are at the police station and she's still so ferocious.

401
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:18,090
- I will sue you! 
 - Calm down!

402
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:19,290
Don't pull me!

403
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:20,830
That's enough.

404
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:23,030
Why are you getting all worked up?

405
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:28,390
- Xiaoling is Siyu's sister and you are my brother. We are a family. How can I not be worked up? 
 - Can you not cause more trouble?

406
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:31,600
- I want to go home! I want to go home! 
 - What's wrong baby?

407
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:35,270
- How about this? You take Liu Yang home. 
 - Then, what about Gu Xiaoling?

408
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:39,350
How could we let the child be at this sort of place?

409
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:41,790
- All right. 
 - Come on.

410
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:43,390
Why are you pulling on me?!

411
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:44,960
Do you feel like you have made a big enough scene out of the situation?

412
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,390
Don't they just want to sue? Do it then!

413
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:52,810
Do you want to have a record?  What about your job? How would you find a boyfriend in the future? How would your future in-laws look at you?

414
00:32:56,780 --> 00:33:00,650
- Listen to me. Compensation is the best plan. 
 - I won't.

415
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:02,930
Are you going to listen to me or not?

416
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:08,320
Compensate how?

417
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:11,060
Are you going to listen to me?

418
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:25,080
Lan Ke, I used to wonder why Xiaoling liked you so much.

419
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,330
I finally know today.

420
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:30,220
I've seen your photo on Xiaoling's phone.

421
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:32,000
I thought you were pretty handsome.

422
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,640
But after seeing you in person today, I realized, hey,

423
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,110
you are better looking in person.

424
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:44,850
Come, sit and take your time to talk.

425
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:49,830
Lan Ke, since you and Xiaoling used to date,

426
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:52,260
let's forget about today.

427
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:56,290
Lan Ke, think about it.

428
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:59,700
If your father hears about today, what would he think?

429
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:03,060
He is a well-known entrepreneur. He probably especially hates your scandals, right?

430
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:06,030
Lan Ke was beaten in public to look like this,

431
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:08,440
where is our "face"? 
 (T/N: face is equivalent to dignity/respect/reputation)

432
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:15,170
Lisa, since today's events took place, Xiaoling and Lan Ke's relationship is completely over.

433
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:17,170
Who do you think will be Lan ke's next girlfriend?

434
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:18,900
What are you trying to say?

435
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:21,040
It was wrong for Xiaoling to hit you.

436
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,730
But it's a fact that you got in between their relationship.

437
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:27,250
Lan Ke and I are just friends.

438
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:29,550
The drone took the photo.

439
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:35,680
Lisa, as I remember, you are a live broadcaster. Right?

440
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:39,830
If someone uploads today's photo online, I wonder what your fans will say.

441
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:42,950
- Don't threaten me! 
 - I am not threatening you.

442
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:44,770
I'm being considerate of you.

443
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:48,290
If today's event gets blown up, then you, an internet celebrity, will be yelled at online.

444
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:51,050
That... would be a huge problem.

445
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:53,960
Lan Ke, I will listen to you.

446
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,630
I will do whatever you say to do.

447
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:00,830
All right, I won't pursue the assault,

448
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:04,980
but you guys are responsible for repairing our cars.

449
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,620
Sure.

450
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:17,360
 Are you still at the police station? 

451
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:20,800
 Wait for me. I will go pick you up soon. 

452
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,280
 Want to relax?  I'll keep you company tonight. 

453
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,250
Lisa! Thank you for getting rid of the garbage.

454
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,180
Let's go, Xiaoling. I will take you back.

455
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,740
Let's go.

456
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,450
If you knew this would be the result, then why did you do what you did?

457
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:08,510
- I don't need you to bother me. 
 - I just helped you take care of such a big mess.

458
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:11,070
Did I ask you to butt into my business?

459
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,870
- Let's go. Let me take you back. 
 - I don't want you to take me back.

460
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:27,480
Driver, be careful.

461
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:37,410
Zhizhi, let's go. We will take you back.

462
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:39,330
It's okay, I will take a taxi myself.

463
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:41,860
It's really nothing. We'll take you home on the way.

464
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:44,010
There's really no need.

465
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:54,840
Yiming, how's it go? Where is Xiaoling?

466
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,580
She went home.

467
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:59,880
How could you let her go home alone? She needs someone to keep her company right now.

468
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,320
Don't worry. She is strong.

469
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,680
By the way, Brother Haowen, are they home?

470
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,540
They are. Don't worry.

471
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:09,590
Is there an event? How come they are at home right now?

472
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:14,330
Yuwei was tired and fussing about going home so Liu Yang told me to take them home.

473
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:15,840
Damn it! That's not good.

474
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,610
- I have hurry and head back. 
 - What's wrong?

475
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,950
Today, we have a parent group meeting.

476
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:24,420
They said it's to discuss something very important.

477
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:26,920
It wasn't easy to finally get Yuwei in kindergarten.

478
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,280
We can't let others look down upon her.

479
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:35,450
Understood.

480
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:37,840
- I'm leaving. Bye-bye. 
 - Bye-bye.

481
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:51,920
Thank you for today.

482
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,760
You're not angry at me anymore?

483
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:04,530
I've always been weak. I can only be angry for two hours.

484
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:08,880
It's my fault. I didn't do well today.

485
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,330
I didn't control my emotions well.

486
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:15,660
I'm also at fault. I did not expect

487
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:18,850
that you would prepare

488
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:20,910
a limited-edition movie.

489
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:23,740
That's right, I—

490
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:26,700
I wanted to give you a surprise.

491
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:29,070
Turns out, not only was it spoiled

492
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:33,470
but I also turned a romantic movie into an action movie.

493
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,930
Siyu...

494
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:40,990
Yiming...

495
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:44,900
You don't want to continue showing the movie

496
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:47,800
at a midnight showtime, right?

497
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,990
I— Siyu, actually, I—

498
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:53,010
Do you really think we are ready for that?

499
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:59,020
You forgot to take this.

500
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,060
Thank you.

501
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:04,720
Can I call you "sister"?

502
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,010
Sister, I am really sorry.

503
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:10,010
Your car was hit, and we took up so much of your time.

504
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:12,560
- You can solve problems quite well. 
 - No,

505
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,310
I was just reasoning with them. Sister, how about we add each other's WeChat?

506
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:19,610
There's no need, right? I have your number. I'll call you if necessary.

507
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:22,680
That works. Once the 4S store determine the damage costs, 
 (T/N: 4S store means authorize car dealership that does sales, spare parts, service, and surveys)

508
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:25,560
- I'll pay what I need to pay. 
 - All right.

509
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,910
- Goodbye. 
 - Goodbye.

510
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:41,350
Actually, you are not ready, right?

511
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:44,080
What I mean is that...

512
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,030
It's the middle of the night...

513
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:49,300
and we're at the entrance of the police station. We just took care of the fighting situation.

514
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:52,030
Isn't it a bit inappropriate?

515
00:39:53,010 --> 00:39:57,410
Besides, I hope that when I remember it in the future that it would be especially beautiful.

516
00:39:57,410 --> 00:40:00,550
There wouldn't be so much mess like this.

517
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:07,700
All right. Then...

518
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:11,750
I will... pick another time.

519
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:14,040
But don't worry.

520
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:18,530
I will definitely give you the most beautiful moment.

521
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:32,820
Yiming, thank you.

522
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,000
-  Is she asleep? 
 - Yes.

523
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,930
Why didn't you go to the parents' group meeting?

524
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:26,910
Yuwei was so tired. If we went then she would have been fussing too much.

525
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:30,690
You should have still gone. It wasn't easy to get into kindergarten.

526
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:33,770
How could we just not go?

527
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:35,940
I have to submit an important report tomorrow.

528
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:39,730
If something goes wrong, a mere parents' meeting wouldn't make up for it.

529
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:43,670
Okay, okay. Report, report.

530
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:49,790
Is Gu Xiaoling's matter resolved?

531
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:51,820
With Sister Siyu and Yiming,

532
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:54,530
there's nothing that can't be solved.

533
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:59,050
Did Chen Yiming propose at the end?

534
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:01,800
- I don't know. I left first. 
 - Oh.

535
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:10,900
Back then, there were no roses

536
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:13,180
nor a diamond ring,

537
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:16,460
yet I stupidly got married to you.

538
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:18,740
You don't like those things anyway.

539
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:21,560
What kind of woman doesn't like those things?

540
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:27,960
Now all those are not important.

541
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,820
The most important now is our Yuwei.

542
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:34,140
Yuwei's education. Yuwei's kindergarten.

543
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:38,030
We cannot be absent from the parents' group meeting from now on.

544
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:40,560
Why are you at it again?

545
00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:44,640
All right, all right.

546
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:52,450
[This is Shanghai.]

547
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:54,560
[Work hard for your dream]

♫  Let go of obsessions, of the present, and of greed  ♫

556

♫  Turn difficulties into courage  ♫

569
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:46,030
♫  Don't back down from the crowd  ♫

570
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:49,300
♫  Growth is inevitably accompanied by setbacks  ♫

571
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:52,150

572
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:54,210
♫  All the punishment given by fate, are you afraid?  ♫

573
00:44:54,210 --> 00:44:56,390
♫  Let everything go, all those concerns, real or fake  ♫

574
00:44:56,390 --> 00:44:59,520
♫  Cannot erase the scar, but it's just a scar  ♫

575
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,010
♫  We are so small yet so determined  ♫

576
00:45:01,010 --> 00:45:02,840
♫  Occasionally fussy and occasionally firm  ♫

577
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:05,370
♫  If growth leaves a trace, then the trace is left be tears.  ♫

578
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:08,990
♫  Your back that I've always been chasing  ♫

579
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:11,210
♫  Finally turned around to hug me tightly  ♫

580
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:14,830
♫  It's still that familiar you  ♫

581
00:45:14,830 --> 00:45:18,940
♫  Yeah..  ♫

582
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:27,600
♫  Dear Myself  ♫

583
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:30,940
♫  Listen to the voice inside  ♫

584
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:35,080
♫  I'll give you the warm that the wind took  ♫

585
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:37,410
♫  Hugging you, hugging me  ♫

♫   Dear Myself  ♫

587
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:44,660
♫  The sky has finally cleared  ♫

588
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:48,050
