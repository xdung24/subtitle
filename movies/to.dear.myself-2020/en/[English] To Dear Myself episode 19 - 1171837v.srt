[Episode 19]

4
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,610
- Sister Siyu. 
 - Hey.

5
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:46,100
Zhizhi, where are you going?

6
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,950
Sister Siyu, I'm here to ask for a leave. I have some things to take care of.

7
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,730
What things?

8
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,180
Heart bypass?

9
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:05,190
The results of the radiography say that coronary artery disease is very serious.

10
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:08,720
A big part of the artery is obstructed and needs surgery immediately.

11
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,190
How much would that cost?

12
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:14,360
The amount that I have to pay... isn't a small number.

13
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,400
Why is that?

14
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,730
Hey, Liu Yang.

15
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,490
What?!

16
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:31,420
All right, I'll be right there.

17
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,710
What happened?

18
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:35,650
Liu Yang's mom ran away from the hospital. I need to go find her.

19
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:39,430
Wait, wait, wait! I'll go with you. Let me go get my keys.

20
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,570
I was just going to give her an IV. She kept complaining she wanted to go home. She didn't want to do the surgery anymore.

21
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:47,360
I was just starting to persuade her. I turned around and she was gone.

22
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,700
What's going on with you family members? Why don't you guys accompany the patient?

23
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,700
Hey, hey!

24
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,860
Hey!

25
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,340
Mom!

26
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,270
Mom!

27
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:43,040
She's not at the hospital. She's also not at home.

28
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,380
All right, you go to the train station and I'll go to the bus station.

29
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,300
Hello. Chengdudong, Sichuan.

30
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,190
Hello. Two tickets, please.

31
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,290
Sister Siyu!

32
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,030
[Train: G2193 To: Chengdudong]

33
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,760
Excuse me, I need to get through.

34
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,500
Thank you.

35
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,740
Mom! Mom!

36
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,470
Sorry.

37
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:15,050
Mom.

38
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,400
Where are you going?

39
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,790
I'm going home.

40
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:25,590
Do you know that you must still stay in the hospital?

41
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:27,760
I'm fine. I'm fine now.

42
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,820
What do you mean you are fine? You must get surgery immediately.

43
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,580
Come back with me.

44
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:37,450
Those doctors don't know anything. Don't listen to them scare people.

45
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:41,270
Mom, are you worried about the money?

46
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:44,220
Don't worry. I have enough money.

47
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:51,670
Yang, I overheard your phone calls.

48
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:57,100
I don't want to make it that difficult for you. I don't want to become your burden.

49
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,800
Mom, I have my ways.

50
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,470
What kind of ways do you have?

51
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:06,120
I'm really fine. I'm fine now. My body is strong.

52
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,520
Look, I'm completely fine. I can even jump. Look at me.

53
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,650
Why are you jumping? Mom, mom, mom!

54
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:13,190
Mom!

55
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:18,900
Mom, careful. Where's your medicine?

56
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,870
In my bag.

57
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:45,880
Do you feel a bit better?

58
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,270
Yeah.

59
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:52,840
Mom's fine. I'm fine.

60
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,760
Mom.

61
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:59,140
If something happens to you, what should I do?

62
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:07,030
Yang,

63
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:13,520
Mom knows of your hardships.

64
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:18,280
Mom doesn't want to become your burden.

65
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,950
Okay?

66
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,490
Mom,

67
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,300
I'm useless.

68
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:36,140
Stupid child.

69
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,340
You're great.

70
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:41,900
You're fine. Come on, let's get up. Send me off.

71
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,340
Mom.

72
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,870
Mom, don't worry.

73
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:08,300
Even if I go bankrupt, I will get your diseased cured.

74
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:27,280
Mom, don't cry. Let's go home.

75
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,050
Let's go home.

76
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:38,210
Okay.

77
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:42,580
Did he find her?

78
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,230
Yeah, Liu Yang is bringing his mom back to the hospital right now.

79
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:50,200
It's good that he found her.

80
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,630
Then I'll take you to the hospital.

81
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:04,000
Why do you think Liu Yang's mom suddenly ran away from the hospital?

82
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,750
It's because of the surgery costs.

83
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,470
Have you guys still not gotten enough?

84
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:11,960
We've borrowed from here and there, but we still don't have enough.

85
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,920
Zhizhi, why didn't you ask me?

86
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:21,740
Liu Yang said... that right now is not the right time to ask you.

87
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,910
Why?

88
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:26,300
He said that you are bidding.

89
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:31,400
Let's go.

90
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:46,100
I can go up there myself. You should go back to the company.

91
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,220
Then if you need anything, remember to contact me.

92
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,170
Okay, be careful on your way.

93
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,210
Is Mom okay?

94
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:27,370
She's temporarily stable.

95
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:37,620
Zhizhi, come out for a second.

96
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,160
Our house, can we get a mortgage loan?

97
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,440
The bank definitely won't give us a loan.

98
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,680
We can only ask outside companies, but...

99
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:02,930
the interest is too high.

100
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:08,960
I can't care too much about that. We need to get enough money for Mom's surgery.

101
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,160
Okay.

102
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:17,890
Hey, family of bed 34's patient, your surgery is scheduled for next Wednesday.

103
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,090
But we haven't paid for the surgery costs.

104
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:23,430
You guys paid. How else could we schedule the surgery?

105
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:24,660
Who paid?

106
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,660
I don't know about that.

107
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:35,720
Look, Li Siyu.

108
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:47,210
Such a big favor, how can we pay her back?

109
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:02,540
Mr. Liu, I put the report on your desk.

110
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,340
Brother Yang, why are you here?

111
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,120
I'm worried about work.

112
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,300
If there is no urgent work, just stay at the hospital with Aunt.

113
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,500
- I will call you if there is something. 
 - Okay.

114
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,500
How is Aunt?

115
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,150
She is good today.

116
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:23,520
But we can't delay the surgery anymore.

117
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,120
Oh, right.

118
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:41,730
What's this for?

119
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:44,840
Brother Yang, sorry, I don't have much money.

120
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,330
I only have ¥2,000. Just take it.

121
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,850
You are just an intern.

122
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:52,760
How much can you earn monthly? How can I take your money?

123
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,340
Even though it's not much,

124
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,590
you must take it.

125
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:57,880
This is my regard to Aunt.

126
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,800
I accept your kind regard but keep the money.

127
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,300
- Take it! 
 - No worries!

128
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,540
I collected enough money.

129
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,640
- Really? 
 - Yeah.

130
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,940
Zhizhi's cousin paid a part for us.

131
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:31,880
Welcome back home.

132
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:08,750
We have a bath tub!

133
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:21,150
The bedroom is pretty big.

134
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,590
Take a look at the living room.

136
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:58,650
We finally have a home now.

137
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:14,070
Let's celebrate.

138
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:21,920
We don't need to be afraid of the rent increasing anymore.

139
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,300
We also don't need to worry that the landlord selling the house anymore.

140
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,720
From now on, we will be mortgage slaves.

141
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,190
We have finally become mortgage slaves.

142
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:01,120
The city is really quite magical.

143
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:05,970
It can instantly

144
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,960
make you proud and self-satisfied.

145
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,730
It can also, instantly,

146
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,540
make you feel like you are nothing.

147
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,230
In the one moment,

148
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:23,060
you thought the future was already at your fingertips.

149
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:25,420
In the next moment,

150
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,650
you may lose everything.

151
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,430
Why do you feel like that?

152
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:45,190
In these three months,

153
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:47,560
I felt like I was on a roller coaster.

154
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,660
Overnight,

155
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:54,500
an elite young man

156
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,700
becomes an unemployed person.

157
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:01,380
I was struck down

158
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,310
and rejected constantly.

159
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:09,960
When I lost all my confidence,

160
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,760
I got everything back suddenly.

161
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,130
Right now, I really feel

162
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:25,630
like everything's unreal.

163
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:31,250
I don't know which one is the real me.

164
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,750
I also don't know

165
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,150
if i can grasp onto

166
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:40,430
what I have now forever.

167
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,390
What?

168
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,460
- What are you doing? 
 - Come here.

169
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:08,460

♫  It's the beautiful scenery that I want to go to  ♫

182
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:05,840
♫  It's all hidden in your eyes  ♫

183
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,770
♫  I want to give all of me to you  ♫

184
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:13,800
♫  Even my bad temper  ♫

185
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,180
♫  We're getting closer  ♫

186
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:21,200
♫ so let me fall in love ♫

187
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,560
♫  In this lifetime, I just want to tightly hold your hand  ♫

188
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:29,160
I think... 
 ♫  As we slowly walk and slowly feel  ♫

189
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,270
that when we renovate the kitchen,

190
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:34,310
we must make it feel like a game.

191
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:39,470
Then when we wash dishes, we won't feel like we are doing housework but like playing a game instead.

192
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:44,190
Makes sense.

193
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:45,980
The study room...

194
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:49,040
needs to be in a night market style. That way,

195
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,220
when we work in the study,

196
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,380
there is an illusion that we are not working,

197
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:56,990
but strolling around the night market.

198
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:59,610
That also works. It can be considered some kind of psychological comfort.

199
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:03,270
Hey, I am more concerned with the bedroom.

200
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,880
I haven't thought about it.

201
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,240
Would it be... in an evil but charming style,

202
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,640
like me; or in old-fashioned style to suit you?

203
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,740
Old-fashioned?

204
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,810
No.

205
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:27,490
The impression that I left for you in the bedroom during these 5 years is "old-fashioned?"

206
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:30,250
Then would you be evil yet charming like me?

207
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,190
I think so.

208
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:39,980
Hey,

209
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:43,130
let's use your credit card for the renovation costs.

210
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,900
Why? Did you max out your card again?

211
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,920
You probably don't know.

212
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,980
Liu Yang's mom had a heart attack. She needs to get surgery urgently.

213
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:56,620
I paid a part of the surgery fee for them.

214
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:57,910
So I don't have any credit left.

215
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:00,240
I didn't know that. You didn't tell me.

216
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,750
How much of the surgery fee did you pay?

217
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,410
More than ¥30,000.

218
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,430
I was thinking,

219
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:09,450
if they can repay it then they should repay it. But if they can't,

220
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:12,620
then we just consider it as sponsoring them. You wouldn't be against it, right?

221
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,710
I, of course, wouldn't be against it.

222
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,250
What's up?

223
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,210
I remembered that you told me

224
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:27,660
you submitted a bid in Liu Yang's project, right?

225
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:30,450
- Yes. 
 - At what stage is the project right now?

226
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:33,280
These two things are not related at all.

227
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,260
I'm waiting for the result.

228
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,310
Don't wait for the result. Take the initiative to back out.

229
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,390
Why?

230
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:51,390
If you look at these two things together, it really seems like like you are bribing him.

231
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:53,140
I absolutely don't have that intention.

232
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,750
I know you don't have that intention.

233
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:58,020
But its hard to explain clearly to others when you are in such a suspicious circumstance.

234
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:03,380
I did this purely to help Zhizhi and Liu Yang!

235
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,640
Yes, it's because you want to help them,

236
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,210
so more reason why you should take the initiative to back out.

237
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:10,590
Why?

238
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,860
How come you don't understand? Think about it.

239
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:19,380
If they find out about the situation and it gets out, what are you going to do?

240
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,690
Liu Yang will get into a lot of trouble immediately.

241
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:25,060
Won't Zhizhi also get involved?

242
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:27,740
No one will know about this.

243
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:30,720
There is "no impermeable wall in this world." 
 (T/N: nothing can be a secret forever)

244
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,770
Chen Yiming,

245
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:43,010
are you saying this because you are Tianye Group?

246
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,590
What do you mean?

247
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,430
If I back out of this bid,

248
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:51,600
then ¥28,000,000 will be gone.

249
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,260
My President Pan will be in a disadvantageous position again with your President Wang.

250
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:56,320
In front of  your President Wang,

251
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,630
you would have another contribution.

252
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:03,030
Do you really see me that way?

253
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:08,000
It's not like you didn't do something similar before.

254
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,800
I admit...

255
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:18,000
I had my own selfish desires when I did that.

256
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:22,390
I wanted to quickly prove my worth.

257
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,800
But this time it's different.

258
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,600
I am really thinking about you

259
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,600
and Liu Yang.

260
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,090
How about this?

261
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,800
I will resign from Tianye.

262
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,800
I won't work there anymore. Will you trust me now?

263
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,400
Where are you going?

264
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,000
I'm going home to write my resignation letter right now.

265
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,700
You don't have to resign.

266
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,800
I trust you.

267
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:09,300
Siyu, I really am not joking.

268
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,300
I comply with you.

269
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,000
Back out immediately? Why?

270
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,600
I don't want my friend to be suspected of taking bribes.

271
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,200
You have a clear conscience. What are you afraid of?

272
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:20,400
But this situation is really hard to explain.

273
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,000
President Pan, we will still have a chance next time.

274
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Li Siyu, we don't have another chance.

275
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,900
No way.

276
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,300
Right now, I'm negotiating with Wang Ziru.

277
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:43,400
I believe that Lubao is worth at least ¥4,000,000,000, but she doesn't think so.

278
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,800
You know about the report.

279
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:49,000
She believes that Lubao is only worth ¥3,000,000,000.

280
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,200
If you lose this government project,

281
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,800
then in her eyes, Lubao will probably only be worth ¥2,000,000,000.

282
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,400
But aren't there two other companies?

283
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,800
Two weeks ago,

284
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:04,000
both of them suddenly backed out for no reason.

285
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,400
Now, only Tianye Group is left.

286
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,700
I want to change how things are right now.

287
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,800
Lubao3 must be mass-produced,

288
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:19,000
but it needs an investment of at least ¥800,000,000.

289
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,200
Yet, the current company's shareholding structure

290
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,200
can only give up 20% of the shares at most.

291
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,600
That's why Lubao's valuation must not go down! This government project

292
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,500
must not be lost! We must win the bid. We must!

293
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:35,000
- But... 
 - Not only does this affect the future of Lubao,

294
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,200
but it also puts all of the livelihoods of Lubao's employees

295
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,000
and the dreams of the two of us on the line.

296
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,100
Brother Yang.

297
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,180
What?

298
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:02,600
Okay... I got it.

299
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:06,660
What happened?

300
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:12,800
President Pan, we won the bid.

301
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:18,200
What did I say? This is the result I wanted!

302
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,300
This is the result I wanted.

303
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:26,800
Xiao Ai, notify Tianye's President Wang immediately.

304
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:31,400
Tell her that I have time now and can meet her at any time. Any time.

305
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:37,000
Now let's see how Wang Ziru bargains with me.

306
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,400
Li Siyu, this time, I will reward you heavily.

307
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,200
I must reward you heavily.

308
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,400
President Pan, I'm still

309
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,800
- a little worried— 
 - Let me tell you, this news is worth at least ¥300,000,000.

310
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,800
It will allow me to open another lab.

311
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,600
I'll be able to start another production line!

312
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,500
Li Siyu.

313
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:59,000
We're going to make China's best power batteries!

314
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
We're going to make China's biggest new energy enterprise!

315
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,800
Just you wait. We will definitely

316
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:11,600
be able to get China's energy to drive civilization forward.

317
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,520
Definitely.

318
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,500
Doctor, these indexes are quite high. Is there a problem?

319
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,800
Doctor, these indexes of hers don't seem to be going down. Why is that?

320
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:32,300
It's mostly due to her old age. It would be more ideal if we used imported medicine,

321
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,600
but you guys requested to switch to domestically produced medicine

322
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:38,000
so the effects will happen slowly.

323
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,900
Thank you.

324
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,600
Liu Yang, what did the doctor say?

325
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,400
You have the nerve to ask.

326
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,400
Wha—

327
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,000
Mom.

328
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,200
Auntie, we came to visit you.

329
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,200
Auntie, we brought some things for you.

330
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,200
- Let me. We can put them here for now. 
 - Thank you.

331
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,000
- I'll put these here. 
 - Okay..

332
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,200
You came at the wrong time. I was about to leave.

333
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,200
So hasty?

334
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,000
It is because of your company.

335
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,400
We have a meeting today to confirm the purchase contract details.

336
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:45,000
Brother Yang, I know there are things that I can't make clear right now,

337
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,400
but trust me,

338
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:50,600
all the ways you've helped Lubao and me, I have taken them to heart.

339
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,800
Don't say that. I didn't do anything.

340
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,800
I get it.

341
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,000
Mom, rest well. I'm going to work for a meeting.

342
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,600
Go ahead.

343
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,100
I'm leaving then.

344
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,400
- Bye-bye. 
 - Bye-bye.

345
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,600
Sit down, Honey.

346
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,200
Liu Yang.

347
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,400
Liu Yang!

348
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:15,300
What's with your attitude toward me just now?

349
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,400
Let me ask you. Why did you change the medicine?

350
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,800
What medicine?

351
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:30,000
How much of a cost difference is there between Chinese and foreign medicines?

352
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,200
You can't even bear to spend that little bit of extra money? That's my mom!

353
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,200
No!

354
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,400
Then, why did the medicine get changed?

355
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,400
I didn't say to change it.

356
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,200
The nurse's office wanted me to make a deposit. I asked if I can do it in a few days,

357
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,800
and they said that we could discuss it.

358
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,200
Discuss it?

359
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,200
Was the result of the discussion was to change the medicine?

360
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:51,400
I know that you and my mom have conflicts,

361
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,500
but she's already like this!

362
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:56,300
Can't you have a conscience?

363
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,800
How do I not have one?

364
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,600
Why would you say that I don't?

365
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,000
Then, why did you agree to let them take such measures?

366
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,700
Don't we have no money?

367
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,000
I asked you to come first thing in the morning to take care of Mom.

368
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,400
You didn't come until noon to come. Why?

369
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,000
I needed to go to work.

370
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,200
You couldn't take leave?

371
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,600
I've already taken leave three times this week! How could I ask again?

372
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,000
Why would it be so hard to ask?

373
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,700
An elementary kid could do your work1

374
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,600
Yes.

375
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,200
My work is not very important.

376
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,400
But I still get a few thousand a month.

377
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:41,600
I can't just give up those few thousand yuan.

378
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:46,400
Zhang Zhizhi, in terms of relations, you are Liu Family's daughter-in-law.

379
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:50,000
In terms of logic, you were the one who angered Mom so much that she's in this condition.

380
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,200
Thus, no matter what,

381
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,500
you should be the one who pays your filial piety at her bedside.

382
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:02,400
I have to go to work as I take care of our child,

383
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:06,000
I even have to bring soup and food. What more can I do to pay my filial piety?

384
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,400
What do you mean by those words?

385
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,000
Yes.

386
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,800
Yes, I'm the one who angered her into this condition, but she has had a heart problem for the last ten years.

387
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:21,300
That should have nothing to do with me, right?

388
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,600
You're absolutely unreasonable and hopeless.

389
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,600
Xiaoling's gallery is showing an exhibit these days, so she's very busy. She said she'll come visit you in a few days.

390
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,300
Okay, okay. Thank you.

391
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:13,460
- What's wrong? 
 - Nothing.

392
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:20,000
Mom, is the height of the bed okay? Do you want me to make it higher?

393
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,800
No, it's fine this way.

394
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,650
It's fine.

395
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:30,030
It's okay. That's fine.

396
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,200
Yiming.

397
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:38,070
Yiming, wait for me!

398
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,830
Yiming!

399
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,600
Chen Yiming!

400
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,600
Yiming!

401
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,400
Are you mad about the bidding thing?

402
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,300
What do you think?

403
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,800
Didn't you promise me that you would back out of it?

404
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,400
It's not easy as you think it is.

405
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,200
It's you who made it complicated.

406
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,800
How did I make it complicated?

407
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:08,800
This doesn't just affect me. It also affects President Pan and the few hundred workers of Lubao.

408
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,600
This isn't something I can decide by myself.

409
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,800
Then what about Liu Yang? Have you thought about him?

410
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,200
I have. Liu Yang and I are clean.

411
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:19,800
I give him money because Zhizhi is my cousin. My conscience is clear.

412
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,400
This is your one side of the story.

413
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:24,800
But more people will think that this is a transfer of benefits.

414
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,600
The truth is that we don't have a transfer of benefits.

415
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,700
How are you so stubborn, Li Siyu? No one will believe your one side of the story.

416
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:34,000
How is it just one side of the story? Only you would think that!

417
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,800
Can you stop lying to yourself?

418
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,800
Let me ask you. If something really happens, what then?

419
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,100
How would others see you? They would think that you, Li Siyu,

420
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:45,800
would not care about her friends and play dirty, just for a better sales performance.

421
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,700
I would not care about my friends and play dirty?

422
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:52,600
I had many things that I could do to win, but I didn't do anything

423
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,600
because I believe in the quality of Lubao's products and the fairness of the bidding.

424
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,600
I can't just ruin Lubao's interests and Lubao's workers' livelihood

425
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,700
just because I want to prove that I'm innocent. Right?

426
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,400
Lubao won't be ruined.

427
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:07,300
As long as your President Pan isn't so eager for quick success.

428
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,800
Chen Yiming, just because someone doesn't play dirty doesn't mean he is eager for quick success.

429
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,000
Then, what about you?

430
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,900
Would you dare say that you are trying so hard to force us to back out isn't even a tiny bit for yourself?

431
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,800
I do dare.

432
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,200
What is there for you to dare say?

433
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,400
Did you forget that you just apologized for your own selfishness?

434
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,800
Importunate.

435
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:37,600
Currently, there are still some details that still need consulting.

436
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,200
If it's successful, then next week

437
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:43,800
we can officially sign the contract with the government.

438
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,200
Congratulations, President Pan.

439
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,200
After getting this government project,

440
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,000
there are a lot of friends in the financial circle

441
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,500
who have become interested in Lubao. This is very realistic. So, President Wang,

442
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:02,000
I cave easily with temptation.

443
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,600
You have to work harder.

444
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,900
Isn't that why I'm here?

445
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,400
All right, then let's just get down to business.

446
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:16,200
¥800,000,000, 20%.

447
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,900
¥500,000,000, 20%.

448
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:23,800
President Wang, if you can't even offer ¥800,000,000, then let's stop talking.

449
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:28,800
¥800,000,000 is okay, too. Then I want 30% equity.

450
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,400
Impossible.

451
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,200
Then, how much do you think is doable?

452
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:35,100
I can give you at most 21%.

453
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:42,900
President Pan, Lubao3 still has many problems that need to be resolved.

454
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,800
22%

455
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,800
President Pan,

456
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,600
compared with similar companies,

457
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,800
Lubao's estimated worth doesn't reach ¥4,000,000,000.

458
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,400
Also, Lubao isn't unique.

459
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,800
Lubao is unique.

460
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,600
22%

461
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:09,400
If you keep trying to bargain, then we don't need to discuss any further.

462
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:13,000
Only sellers with sincerity would keep bargaining.

463
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,700
29%.

464
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:26,200
President Wang, let me tell you the truth.

465
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:29,200
There are already some new funds investors who have contacted me.

466
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:33,400
My starting price was 18% for ¥800,000,000. They're very interested.

467
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,700
But a new negotiation would waste a lot of time.

468
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:39,400
So, I was willing to work with you again.

469
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,800
But if you only have this little sincerity,

470
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,600
then I don't mind starting over with new partners.

471
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,200
President Pan,

472
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:52,600
I will also tell you very responsibly that every fund negotiation is like this.

473
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,600
They all start off very sincere.

474
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:58,000
However, once you start to give up on other partners to negotiate with them,

475
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,800
they will start asking for more and more from you.

476
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,800
Then we won't negotiate.

477
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,600
Financing or not...

478
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,600
will not become the deciding factor between the life and death of Lubao anyways.

479
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,800
Worst comes to worst, I will have to work very hard for a few years.

480
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,800
28%.

481
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,000
22%!

482
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,740
22%.

483
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:24,000
This share offer will only be valid for 24 hours.

484
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,000
Otherwise, we will really end this negotiation.

485
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,500
Director Liang, I have an appointment with a client at 3:00 p.m.  It ends at 4:00 p.m. I will find you right after.

486
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,800
Okay. Then see you later.

487
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,400
Kuai Zi!

488
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:07,000
Yes! The file that was sent to us is downloading. I need three more minutes.

489
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,800
Are you still angry?

490
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,400
You haven't contacted me in a week.

491
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,700
You're courage seems to have grown.

492
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:57,900
Today, I will be off work before 10:00 p.m., let's talk?

493
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,000
Are you working overtime today?

494
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:20,070
Should we discuss this nicely?

495
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,800
President Wang.

496
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,400
Yiming.

497
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,500
What's wrong? Are you in a bad mood?

498
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,000
No.

499
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:05,090
Have you met Lubao's Pan Zhiyong before?

500
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,600
Yes.

501
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:11,500
According to your observation, what kind of person is he?

502
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:15,600
He is quite capable.

503
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:18,100
He has insight, courage, and is resolute.

504
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:22,000
However, he is also a little bit headstrong.

505
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:29,200
Then, do you think a person like that

506
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:33,300
would risk bluffing?

507
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,600
Well, that's hard to say.

508
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,300
He is quite unpredictable.

509
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,000
Later, I've asked a few people to come and discuss

510
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,300
the deadlock we have reached with Lubao.

511
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:55,000
Will you come?

512
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,800
Me?

513
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,000
It's not a formal meeting.

514
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,600
Then... Then in that case, I think it's best if I don't participate.

515
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,000
Okay.

516
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,800
Pan Zhiyong already told me that there are other financing companies that have contacted him.

517
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,300
This is very disadvantageous to us.

518
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:20,300
I found that one of Lubao's bank loans is about to expire.

519
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:23,700
This should help us a lot in our next negotiation with them.

520
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,600
That doesn't necessarily mean that they are in need of money though.

521
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:30,200
Could it be that Pan Zhiyong is bluffing?

522
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:35,600
Pan Zhiyong has the personality of a typical leader.

523
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:38,200
He might be a little bit headstrong,

524
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:41,100
but he definitely would not bluff.

525
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,400
I think that getting Pan Zhiyong to agree to raise from 20% to 22%

526
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,200
is already a huge breakthrough.

527
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:53,200
But our goal is to have at least 23%.

528
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,600
Should we reply with 25%?

529
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,800
Would that anger Pan Zhiyong enough to stop discussing with us entirely?

530
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:04,600
People with a leader type personality do not anger easily. They just fear being looked down upon.

531
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:07,200
Then we should insist on 23%.

532
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:11,600
But should we give them a little more valuation?

533
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:15,000
But I think that 22% is already their limit.

534
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,500
Otherwise, why would they give us a 24-hour limit?

535
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:24,600
President Wang, must we give a response within 24 hours?

536
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:25,800
Yes.

537
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,600
We only have 14 hours left.

538
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:36,600
You all can go back. I'll think about it.

541
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,000
♫  How are you?  ♫

542
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,600
♫  Listen to me about the latest news  ♫

543
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:05,100
♫  Some sweet and some hopeless  ♫

544
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:10,100
♫  There are also some that were never said  ♫

545
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:13,600
♫  It's been so long, I've already learned to let go  ♫

546
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:18,200
♫  Let go of obsessions, of the present, and of greed  ♫

547
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:23,200
♫  Yet I've never thought of letting you go  ♫

548
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,600
♫  Yeah…  ♫

549
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:30,000
♫  Oh…  ♫

550
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,200
♫  En…  ♫

551
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,000
♫  Letting go…  ♫

552
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,400
♫  Dear Myself  ♫

553
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,400
♫  Listen to the voice inside  ♫

554
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:43,600
♫  In this lonely world, be cautious ♫

555
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:45,800
 After we're hurt, we learn to cherish  ♫

556
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:49,200
♫  Dear Myself  ♫

557
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,600
♫  Use all your strength  ♫

558
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:56,600
♫  Missing the simple you from the past  ♫

559
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,800
♫  Turn difficulties into courage  ♫

560
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:03,800
♫  Don't back down from the crowd  ♫

561
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,900
♫  Growth is inevitably accompanied by setbacks  ♫

562
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:09,000
♫  The best way to overcome difficulties is to smile  ♫

563
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
♫  All the punishment given by fate, are you afraid?  ♫

564
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,200
♫  Let everything go, all those concerns, real or fake  ♫

565
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,400
♫  Cannot erase the scar, but it's just a scar  ♫

566
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,000
♫  We are so small yet so determined  ♫

567
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,600
♫  Occasionally fussy and occasionally firm  ♫

568
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:22,200
♫  If growth leaves a trace, then the trace is left be tears  ♫

569
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:25,800
♫  Your back that I've always been chasing  ♫

570
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,000
♫  Finally turned around to hug me tightly  ♫

571
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,900
♫  It's still that familiar you  ♫

572
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:35,000
♫  Yeah..  ♫

573
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,900
♫  Oh..  ♫

574
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,600
♫  Dear Myself  ♫

575
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:48,000
♫  Listen to the voice inside  ♫

576
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,800
♫  I'll give you the warm that the wind took  ♫

577
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,200
♫  Hugging you, hugging me  ♫

578
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:57,600
♫   Dear Myself  ♫

579
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:01,600
♫  The sky has finally cleared  ♫

580
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:04,800
♫  We've never been so clear-headed  ♫

581
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,000
♫  Looking for the past me who  ♫

582
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,600
♫  Ran forward without evading anything  ♫

583
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:13,800
♫  Ran forward without evading anything  ♫

584
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:17,200
♫  Listen to the voice inside  ♫

585
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:21,100
♫  The sky has finally cleared  ♫
