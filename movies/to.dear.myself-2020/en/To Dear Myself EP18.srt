00:01:24,075 --> 00:01:26,325
[To Dear Myself]

2
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,200
[Ep18]

3
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:37,719
Do you get used to it?

4
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:39,680
It's ok

5
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,480
What do you mean?

6
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:43,159
I know, you are excellent

7
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,319
So what have you been up to?

8
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,599
I have researched Lubao's market

9
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:54,000
Research?

10
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,879
About what?

11
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:57,799
You shouldn't ask this

12
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,200
I can't tell you even if you ask me

13
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,560
Why?

14
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,359
Because now president Pan and president Wang

15
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,840
are opponents in the negotiation

16
00:02:07,025 --> 00:02:09,240
We are in different companies

17
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:10,960
It's all about work

18
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:17,319
Why do I feel we are estranged?

19
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,520
No

20
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,840
It has nothing to do with the two of us

21
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,000
It's work

22
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,000
What if I think it has something to do with us?

23
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,175
If you think so

24
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:37,039
We need to know this

25
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,479
I can't inqure about your work

26
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:43,650
And you can't ask me about my work

27
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:50,319
Ok

28
00:02:50,825 --> 00:02:53,639
Well. Let's change the topic

29
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:00,360
Are you satisfied with this house?

30
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,879
Of course I am satisfied

31
00:03:03,525 --> 00:03:04,525
I am satisfied

32
00:03:04,525 --> 00:03:06,269
as long as the house belongs to you and me

33
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,039
Sorry, kept you waiting

34
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,639
So...

35
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:14,625
We want to buy that house

36
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,199
The house on Jiangyang Road?

37
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,479
Correct

38
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:19,919
Mr. Chen called me yesterday

39
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:20,439
I remembered it wrong

40
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:21,599
I mistook it to another one

41
00:03:22,175 --> 00:03:23,639
We have sold it the day before yesterday

42
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:27,759
Or, you can see other houses?

43
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:33,520
Here, good bye

44
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:34,319
Ok

45
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:41,400
Brother

46
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:42,960
Get me one

47
00:03:43,475 --> 00:03:45,000
You bought one that day, right?

48
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,080
I want to buy another one

49
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:03,919
For you

50
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,000
For me?

51
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,439
You have stomach problem, right?

52
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,000
Take it, you need to drink warm water

53
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:11,680
Brother Yang, I know this brand

54
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,120
It's so expensive

55
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,240
It's just a thermal mug

56
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,279
Thank you

57
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,399
Look at you

58
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,920
Why are you teary?

59
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,160
You are so kind to me

60
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:45,079
Silly girl

61
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,160
You said, it's an art exhibition

62
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,040
Yes

63
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,560
All the designers here will attend Florence Biennale

64
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,000
It's top art

65
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,920
So beautiful

66
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,120
Actually

67
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:55,560
When it comes jewelry design, it has classicism

68
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,079
orientalism, abstractionism and the influence of abstractionism

69
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:00,199
Like Picasso's daughter

70
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:01,879
She is the representative of surrealism

71
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:04,360
Tiffany represents modernist style

72
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,800
What style do you like?

73
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:13,199
Me?

74
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,399
I like Tiffany's Flower Rhyme series

75
00:06:17,675 --> 00:06:22,200
She integrates the modernism with rigidness and softness

76
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:24,199
It's romantic and harmonious

77
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:26,519
I get it. Wait for me

78
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,240
Thank you

79
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,600
Xiaoling, I know you will like it

80
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:27,720
You are right

81
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:32,439
Designers are so particular about lights, 

82
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:33,759
shadows, colors and lines

83
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,950
Every design is the works of art

84
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,920
Yeah

85
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,639
If you think he loves me

86
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,475
He has the expensive watch, car and villa

87
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:49,240
But he just gives me this?

88
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:53,759
But if you think he doesn't love me, 

89
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:54,839
he invites me to dinner every day and contacts me actively

90
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:57,160
I can feel his true affectionateness

91
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,160
It's not love, or romance

92
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,720
He is stingy

93
00:08:03,825 --> 00:08:05,959
If a man really loves a woman

94
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,225
he will spend money for her as long as he can afford it

95
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:10,639
Xiaoling

96
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:11,600
Just break up

97
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:12,720
No

98
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,879
Why?

99
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,079
I don't want to regret it after I get old

100
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:19,425
I don't want to give up when I have such a good man

101
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,639
But he doesn't love you

102
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:23,639
No, he loves me

103
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:25,959
He is stingy, that's all

104
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,519
It's ok

105
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:29,480
His money will be mine after we get married

106
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,319
He can be stingy as he likes

107
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,440
You think, a stingy man like him will share money with you?

108
00:08:38,558 --> 00:08:39,239
Xiaoling

109
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:40,559
Do you love him?

110
00:08:42,558 --> 00:08:44,639
I love money, he has money

111
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:45,600
So I love him

112
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:47,519
You love money, you should earn it yourself

113
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,840
Why do you rely on the man?

114
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,039
Li Siyu, you are smart, capable

115
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:53,720
a good student in a top university

116
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,840
But I am not that stuff

117
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,039
My family can't help me

118
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,480
My only advantage is my face

119
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,879
Rich people are not stupid

120
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:08,080
Even if he loves you, why he must marry you?

121
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,840
So I try to enrich myself

122
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,200
I need to be more capable

123
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,440
I go for fitness every day

124
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:14,159
I am a good golf player

125
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:16,000
I have subscribed all the official accounts

126
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,639
Can you?

127
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,840
So I am learning art appreciation

128
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,519
I resign from a real estate company

129
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,000
Then I work in a golf club

130
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,879
Then I work in the gallery

131
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:25,600
My next plan is to learn English

132
00:09:25,975 --> 00:09:28,639
I am not taking a shortcut as you think

133
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:30,039
I'm very tired

134
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:37,175
You think everything is fine after you marry a rich man?

135
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,399
What if he has an affair?

136
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:42,440
You think a poor guy won't have an affair?

137
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:46,799
Anyway, I believe Liu Yang

138
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,039
Don't listen to her

139
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,500
I believe Liu Yang and Yiming

140
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,600
Well, how's it going between you and Liu Yang?

141
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,850
He gave me an expensive vacuum cup yesterday

142
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,440
Just vacuum cup, you are so happy?

143
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,799
It's better than a picture album

144
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:15,100
Zhizhi, you are mocking me

145
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:17,120
You are good now

146
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:22,679
We have endless disputes in family

147
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,240
Zhizhi

148
00:10:27,525 --> 00:10:30,159
Why you didn't wear my clothes?

149
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,000
Why you still didn't change your bag?

150
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,500
It's too expensive to wear it

151
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:36,759
Silly girl

152
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,000
Well, Zhizhi

153
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,600
I asked you last time

154
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,045
Would you work with me in the sales department?

155
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,200
Thank you, sister Siyu

156
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:50,639
I have discussed with Liu Yang

157
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,399
Yuwei is still young

158
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:54,919
I need to take care of her

159
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,960
We should talk about it in the future

160
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,600
I told them

161
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:12,850
Liu Yang won't have an affair

162
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,425
You women can't talk about anything meaningful?

163
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,360
Meaningful?

164
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:26,840
Why you didn't throw the cup away?

165
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,159
I can still use it

166
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:29,159
Why throw it?

167
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,480
Use the new cup

168
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:32,000
It's the same

169
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,240
Both for drinking water

170
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,120
Where did you put my vacuum cup?

171
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:37,919
I returned it back

172
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,080
Returned?

173
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,480
It's so expensive

174
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,080
I asked them to return it

175
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,320
They declined me in the beginning

176
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:48,960
They said, I had no invoice

177
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:52,200
Guess what

178
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:56,775
Then I told them if I couldn't get the refund 

179
00:11:56,775 --> 00:11:59,080
I would call the police for their occupying the public area

180
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:00,759
A cup

181
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:01,759
Then they gave in

182
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:02,799
means a lifetime

183
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:03,600
Then they refunded the money

184
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,000
But the refund is a shopping voucher

185
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:08,600
It's ok

186
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,639
When will your mother go back?

187
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:31,600
I will persuade her

188
00:12:50,225 --> 00:12:55,775
So we still differ in the evaluation of Lubao

189
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,552
I think you lack the confidence in Lubao

190
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,639
Confidence comes from strength

191
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:04,679
But don't forget

192
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:06,559
I still have Lubao III

193
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:08,675
Its performance far surpasses Lubao II

194
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,120
Mr. Pan

195
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:15,399
As I know, Lubao III has flaws

196
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,159
Gao Zhengdao said it, right?

197
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:21,559
He just wants to sell his theory

198
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,399
He is so ridiculous like a mad dog

199
00:13:25,925 --> 00:13:30,246
When I have the time, I will critize him with an article

200
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:32,840
I need to teach him a lesson

201
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,080
I attended professor Gao's lecture

202
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,100
But my conclusion doesn't come from him

203
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,625
My company did a little research

204
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:24,720
Wu

205
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:26,759
I inquired a lot

206
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:29,240
I found nothing

207
00:14:30,775 --> 00:14:32,519
He is guarding against us deliberately

208
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,875
We should expose the relationship between Liu Yang and Li Siyu

209
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,440
It's a sure thing

210
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,600
But if we don't take action now

211
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:48,039
we will have no chance after 5 experts' evaluation next week

212
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:49,559
How do you know it's five experts?

213
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:52,159
The director told me to entertain them

214
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:55,475
I am in charge of round trips and meals of those experts

215
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:57,399
Do you know who they are?

216
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:58,240
Yes

217
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:05,279
Take a good look

218
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:07,000
Carefully

219
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:09,639
Why?

220
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:11,679
Why Wang Ziru has the report?

221
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:12,639
But I don't have

222
00:15:13,675 --> 00:15:16,960
Wang Ziru knows the problems better than me

223
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,159
Why?

224
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,750
President Pan, we are working on this

225
00:15:22,225 --> 00:15:24,320
We plan to give you a full report at the end of the month

226
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:26,159
They have the report in advance

227
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:27,120
It's your negligence of work

228
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:28,879
President Pan

229
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:32,825
From the test data, Lubao III has no problem

230
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:37,450
User experience is much more important than your data

231
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,360
But the problems reflected in this report are biased

232
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,125
But I am passive in the negotiation, you know?

233
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:56,919
Li Siyu

234
00:15:58,279 --> 00:15:59,639
Don't think it has nothing to do with you

235
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,320
Let me ask you, what are you doing recently?

236
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:05,600
I am working hard for the target of 500 million in three months

237
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:06,600
How much did you make?

238
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,679
More than 200 million

239
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:14,100
After the report comes out, we lose 300 million

240
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,080
As a sales director

241
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,279
you only care about performance

242
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,559
rather than the products

243
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:21,759
It's also dereliction of duty

244
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:29,399
President Pan

245
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,079
I think this report reminds us of something

246
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:35,399
Before Lubao III becomes perfect

247
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,275
it's a bit risky if it comes to the market on a large scale

248
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:41,679
Let me ask you

249
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:42,960
What's perfect?

250
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:46,159
What is perfect?

251
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,325
Product upgrade is perfection

252
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,639
Improve product performance during use

253
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:54,639
You think it's risky?

254
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,825
If it's risky, I am totally in this

255
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:04,240
Study this report carefully

256
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,039
Find out their weakness

257
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,000
I need to turn the table in the next negotiation

258
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,160
Dismiss

259
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,799
Li Siyu, you should stay

260
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,519
How is the bidding?

261
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:36,839
Almost ok

262
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,240
President Pan

263
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,175
Before printing the package, do you need to check it?

264
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,160
No need

265
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,720
You won't check the quotation?

266
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,960
You will make the decision

267
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,480
I only have one request

268
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,519
We need to win the bid

269
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:52,359
President Pan

270
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,880
No one can guarantee this

271
00:17:55,319 --> 00:17:56,799
You have to promise me

272
00:17:59,039 --> 00:17:59,960
Li Siyu

273
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,039
The situation is here

274
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,200
This report comes out

275
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:09,200
We are going to lose our last hope

276
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:11,519
So we must win the bid

277
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:13,519
Otherwise I and you

278
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,025
will be kicked out out of new energy circle

279
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:30,359
You did this, right?

280
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:37,799
Yes

281
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,119
Why do you research Lubao in secret?

282
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,480
First

283
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:46,480
I didn't research in secret

284
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,000
I did it in broad daylight 

285
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:48,960
Second

286
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,200
I mentioned it to you before

287
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:52,450
But you didn't say you would research Lubao III

288
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
How can I tell you?

289
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,079
Do you know?

290
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,700
Your report ruined my one-month work

291
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:07,720
It shows your dereliction of duty

292
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:09,680
Pan also said so

293
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:13,240
Pan scolded you?

294
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,359
A bloody scold

295
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:18,920
So president Wang taught him a lesson

296
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,480
Right?

297
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,920
You are laughing

298
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,880
My work paid off

299
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,920
Of course I should be happy

300
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,319
What the hell?

301
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,160
Look at your words

302
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,599
It's malicious slander

303
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,800
Every word in it is the fact

304
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,000
Lubao is less than four billion

305
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,920
It's a fact?

306
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,960
If Lubao III can solve my questions

307
00:19:41,225 --> 00:19:42,505
Lubao's evaluation may reach 4 billion

308
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,079
But now absolutely impossible

309
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:47,725
Why do you see Lubao III's problems rather than its strength?

310
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:49,279
This is my duty

311
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:51,640
My responsibility is to remind my boss of the possible trouble

312
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,039
Or what she should be cautious about

313
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:57,525
Have you ever thought if my boss knew you did this,

314
00:19:57,525 --> 00:19:58,839
what would he think of me?

315
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:02,279
It's two different matters

316
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:03,559
No, the same matter

317
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,034
He might even think I revealed something to you

318
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,759
Wang Ziru would think so too

319
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,359
So you sacrificed me

320
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:19,559
I didn't want to sacrifice you

321
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,480
I just do my duty

322
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,519
You don't know anything

323
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,079
The question is who will believe it?

324
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:26,440
Believe it or not

325
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:30,200
We need to do our part in our respective scope

326
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,800
The thing is you have a lot to do

327
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,599
Why do you make this report?

328
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:57,037
This is Tianyi's largest project for now

329
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:00,359
I work in Tianyi now

330
00:21:01,275 --> 00:21:03,559
I need to prove myself, right?

331
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:08,575
You prove yourself by putting me in dilemma

332
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,160
You exaggerated it

333
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,000
I have told you, it has nothing to do with us

334
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,480
It's the battle between two companies

335
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,000
Before that, we are battling now

336
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:20,319
I didn't mean that

337
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:23,119
You can deceive yourself

338
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:24,680
But don't deceive others

339
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:29,759
Siyu...

340
00:21:41,319 --> 00:21:42,599
For this report

341
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,759
Every one of you should give me a solution

342
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,119
Put it on my desk the day after tomorrow

343
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,359
Ok

344
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:03,240
Also remember to keep it secret

345
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,559
Yes

346
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:05,680
Don't tell others

347
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:07,319
Ok

348
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:08,759
Back to work

349
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:28,839
Thank you, brother Yang

350
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,800
During the bidding, your help is much appreciated

351
00:23:32,839 --> 00:23:34,119
To be honest

352
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,720
I am the team leader

353
00:23:35,975 --> 00:23:38,359
I don't have the final say

354
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,160
You need to speak with your products

355
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:41,519
I know

356
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,519
Don't worry, I won't get you in dilemma

357
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:44,640
We will follow the rules

358
00:23:44,975 --> 00:23:49,000
I just hope you can tell me the news in advance

359
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,519
I want to be better prepared

360
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,920
As long as I don't violate the principle

361
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,279
I won't be caught of practicing favouritism 

362
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:57,480
I will help you

363
00:24:24,525 --> 00:24:27,559
Next, experts will be responsible for this

364
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:28,920
We will just assist them

365
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,079
To avoid suspicion

366
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:33,000
we'd better not meet or contact each other

367
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:40,400
Are you ok?

368
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,099
You should make the decision

369
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,519
I only have one request

370
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,519
You must win the bid

371
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:04,079
President Pan, no one can guarantee this

372
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,880
You have to promise me

373
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:39,759
Director Li

374
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:42,279
Director Li

375
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,160
Director Li

376
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,839
President Pan is out

377
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,440
It's ok

378
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,720
Zhizhi

379
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,720
Liu Yang just called

380
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,440
He needs to work overtime

381
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:16,279
He won't come back for dinner

382
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:19,000
Mom, I'm hungry

383
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,680
You just finished the diner, you are hungry now?

384
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:24,400
Come, go...

385
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,400
What are you eating?

386
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,240
Potato chips

387
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:44,359
Who gave it to you?

388
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,279
Me

389
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:49,160
Mom

390
00:27:49,975 --> 00:27:52,440
It's expired potato chips, I threw it away

391
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,920
Why did you pick it up again?

392
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,279
You even give it to Yuwei

393
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:57,200
It just expired a few days

394
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,480
It's food

395
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:01,160
I have tasted it, it's ok

396
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,960
No

397
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:04,279
You can't let Yuwei eat it

398
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:05,519
It's expired

399
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,480
Why?

400
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,799
Why she can't eat it?

401
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:12,675
So picky

402
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:14,599
Mom

403
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,400
Yuwei is my daughter

404
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,200
She is not picked up or adopted

405
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,519
It's my blood

406
00:28:19,975 --> 00:28:22,359
I want to give her the best things in the whole world

407
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,750
I can't allow her to eat expired potato chips

408
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,359
Whatever

409
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,359
You should take credit for having a daughter, right?

410
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,119
Ridiculous

411
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:33,240
Mom

412
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,440
What?

413
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,000
You have said so many times

414
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,279
I have had enough now

415
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:41,160
Let me tell you

416
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,925
If you say so to me and Yuwei again,

417
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,440
you should leave

418
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,599
You'd better go home

419
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:48,680
Why?

420
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:50,480
It's my son's home

421
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,400
I will live here as I want

422
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,200
Want to drive me away? No way

423
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:57,880
Go

424
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,160
Grandma

425
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:01,880
What are you doing?

426
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,119
Grandma

427
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:03,960
What are you doing?

428
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,839
You don't go, I will go

429
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,319
Stop it

430
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:10,759
She doesn't like you at all

431
00:29:10,759 --> 00:29:13,960
Grandma...

432
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:17,640
Grandma

433
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,839
Mom...

434
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,079
Mom...

435
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,680
What's wrong, mom?

436
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,240
Hello

437
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:37,799
What?

438
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:41,680
Dad

439
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,000
Liu Yang

440
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:51,119
Bed No. 34's family

441
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,800
The doctor is ready to see you

442
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:01,400
Yuwei

443
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,759
Wait here

444
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:04,039
Good girl

445
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,680
You come here in time

446
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,319
The patient is safe now

447
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:18,079
Doctor

448
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:19,599
What's wrong with my mom?

449
00:30:20,075 --> 00:30:22,759
My initial diagnosis is, it's an acute myocarditis attack

450
00:30:22,759 --> 00:30:24,279
It may have arterial blockage

451
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:27,960
Is that ok?

452
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,559
We won't know until she has a coronary angiography

453
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,359
The patient needs to rest in bed recently

454
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,480
She needs a light diet

455
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:40,425
And don't irritate the patient

456
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,279
Ok

457
00:30:46,759 --> 00:30:48,119
You need to prepare for angiography now

458
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,440
Why did mom suddenly get sick?

459
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,400
We quarrelled

460
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:08,519
I knew it

461
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,279
I don't know it will be like this

462
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:16,279
If I knew it, I would...

463
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:22,519
Usually, you often contradict my mom

464
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,680
Why do you have so much resentment?

465
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:27,240
No

466
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,240
Why do you blame me indiscriminately?

467
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:43,775
It's ok that you lose your temper in front of me

468
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,759
My mom is so old with a poor health

469
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:46,759
You even contradict her

470
00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:47,920
You are so ridiculous

471
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,920
Dad

472
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,400
Come

473
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,960
Brother Yang, is aunt ok?

474
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,279
She is safe now

475
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,480
Are you ok?

476
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,680
What can I do for you?

477
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:19,160
Thank you

478
00:34:12,518 --> 00:34:16,624
Mom gave Yuwei expired potato chips I tossed in the trash can

479
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,480
So we quarrelled

480
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:24,880
I can bear whatever she says

481
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:31,350
But when she despises Yuwei, I really can't tolerate it

482
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:48,840
I am sorry for my harsh words

483
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:51,440
Sorry

484
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:11,239
You should take some rest

485
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,079
Finally you answer my call

486
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:10,960
I am busy

487
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,440
Where are you now?

488
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:14,480
The company

489
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,960
I will pick you up right now

490
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,079
Now?

491
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,320
Siyu, I want to see you

492
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,920
I want to talk to you

493
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,480
We will talk tomorrow

494
00:36:27,325 --> 00:36:29,880
I am busy today

495
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,119
No

496
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,639
I need to see you today

497
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:04,800
I know you didn't have dinner

498
00:37:06,679 --> 00:37:07,559
I made some porridge

499
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:09,320
I have no appetite

500
00:37:09,639 --> 00:37:10,760
You need to eat

501
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,039
Go

502
00:37:40,679 --> 00:37:41,639
Still angry?

503
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:44,440
No

504
00:37:51,719 --> 00:37:52,679
I have thought about it for a whole day

505
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,960
You questioned me today

506
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:57,079
I have so many things to do

507
00:37:57,639 --> 00:37:59,159
Why do I have to do this?

508
00:38:01,875 --> 00:38:03,960
I really forgot your situation

509
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:07,039
I am so impatient to prove myself in Tianye

510
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:11,679
The negotiation with Lubao is the top priority of Tianyi Group

511
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:15,679
So I take it as a breakthrough point

512
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,719
And I think

513
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,200
Researching the quality of the brand has 

514
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,740
nothing to do with the sales director, so...

515
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,000
Sorry

516
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,920
It's my fault

517
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:31,840
My apology

518
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:37,880
You're right

519
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:41,559
It's our problem

520
00:38:43,225 --> 00:38:48,800
I have told them to make up for the loss because of your report

521
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,599
Here

522
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,519
What is this?

523
00:39:00,875 --> 00:39:08,300
In my research, I inquired about your advertising and after-sales service

524
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:10,880
You should give it to president Wang

525
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,599
Why do you give it to me?

526
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:14,000
She doesn't care about it

527
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,440
But you as the sales director

528
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,039
I think you need it

529
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:22,500
The last few pages are my suggestions

530
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,880
I hope it can make up for my fault

531
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:35,679
Thank you

532
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:44,280
Siyu

533
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,659
Let's go to see the house tomorrow

534
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:49,239
Then sign the contract

535
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,639
What happened?

536
00:39:56,159 --> 00:39:57,975
Still blaming me?

537
00:39:58,960 --> 00:39:59,800
No

538
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:02,679
Thinking of something else

539
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:03,800
What's the matter?

540
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:11,840
Lin Ling has a client

541
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,366
Very important to her, to everyone and the company

542
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,280
She needs to get it

543
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:20,440
Now there is a grey channel

544
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,125
It can help her win the client

545
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,880
Do you think she should use the grey channel?

546
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,599
What's your take?

547
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,039
I don't know

548
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,559
You have said, it's grey channel

549
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,639
You have your own judgement

550
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,880
But I am also afraid to lose the client

551
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:40,559
Siyu

552
00:40:41,559 --> 00:40:42,599
We have known each other for five years

553
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:45,360
You are never afraid to lose clients

554
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,450
Because even if you lose, you can find them back soon

555
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,079
Am I?

556
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:51,800
Of course

557
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:54,750
Actually losing clients is not a big deal

558
00:40:55,600 --> 00:41:01,050
But if you lose another thing, you will never find it back

559
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:21,910
Sign the contract and buy the house tomorrow

560
00:42:12,199 --> 00:42:12,920
Liu Yang

561
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:13,719
Director

562
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:15,920
I want to ask you a favor

563
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,639
Don't be so polite

564
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:18,760
Say it

565
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,679
My mother is sick and hospitalized

566
00:42:22,679 --> 00:42:23,800
I want to borrow some money from you

567
00:42:24,775 --> 00:42:28,480
Well, wait for me

568
00:42:30,519 --> 00:42:31,199
Who?

569
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,400
It's Liu Yang

570
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,320
His mother is sick

571
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:35,440
He wants to borrow some money

572
00:42:35,559 --> 00:42:36,480
Borrow money?

573
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,079
Will he return the money?

574
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:40,400
Did your cousin return the money last week?

575
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:49,760
Mom

576
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,639
How do you feel?

577
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:56,079
I'm fine, much better

578
00:42:58,960 --> 00:42:59,840
Drink some water

579
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:02,039
No need...

580
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,599
I'm fine

581
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:17,159
Excuse me

582
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,199
Hello, Liu Yang

583
00:43:26,719 --> 00:43:27,920
My wife disagrees

584
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:29,280
I can't do anything

585
00:43:30,675 --> 00:43:34,000
I can give you my case-dough, 5000 yuan

586
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:36,039
Director, no, thanks

587
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:37,360
I will think about other ways

588
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:39,355
I'm sorry

589
00:43:39,775 --> 00:43:41,760
Thank you, anyway

590
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,039
Xing

591
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:46,920
I want to ask you a favor

592
00:43:47,239 --> 00:43:49,639
My mother is sick and hospitalized

593
00:43:49,639 --> 00:43:50,719
She needs a bypass surgery

594
00:43:52,639 --> 00:43:53,559
Just bought a house?

595
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,360
Congratulations...

596
00:43:57,039 --> 00:43:58,880
Classmate, I need to ask you a favor

597
00:43:59,719 --> 00:44:00,559
I can understand

598
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,480
Yes, it's not easy to have a startup

599
00:44:03,079 --> 00:44:03,719
It's ok

600
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,280
Thank you, anyway

601
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:07,119
Bye

602
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:19,719
Hello

603
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:22,987
Hello, sir, do you want to have a real estate?

604
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:24,159
No

605
00:44:34,599 --> 00:44:35,679
Bed No.34's family

606
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,000
Did you pay the money?

607
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:38,639
Not yet

608
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:39,599
Hurry up

609
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:41,320
Many people are waiting for surgery

610
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,079
Pay early

611
00:44:43,239 --> 00:44:44,159
You will have the surgery sooner

612
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,599
Mom, what do you want to eat?

613
00:45:06,599 --> 00:45:08,400
I will tell Zhizhi to make it for you

614
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:13,039
How much is my surgery?

615
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:14,639
Never mind it

616
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:15,800
We have the money

617
00:45:18,559 --> 00:45:19,840
I don't want it

618
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,800
Mom, you need to do the surgery

619
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:26,039
You really have the money?

620
00:45:26,039 --> 00:45:26,800
Yes

621
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:28,800
Don't worry about it
