00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:37,239
No way

3
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:41,719
Pink represents the princess

4
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,959
You connected a phone in two years

5
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:43,640
Never call

6
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,799
Now suddenly this request

7
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:45,840
Don't you think it's too much, I ask you

8
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,120
I want to be a princess

Can't go

15
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,000
You have a peanut allergy

16
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,640
You can’t eat ice powder, you know?

17
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:08,680
And you

18
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,400
Already have cavities

19
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,520
Can't eat sugar

20
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:13,840
Is this good

21
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,439
Who of you can

22
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:15,520
Make dad laugh

23
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:17,199
Anyone can eat ice cream

25
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:18,520

00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,199
Yuwei, what are you doing, Susan

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,000

00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,039
What are you doing

31
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:32,719
I asked you what

32
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,000
Yuwei, what are you doing

33
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:35,960
Making faces

34
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,159
Smiled smiled smiled

35
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:37,879
Laughed

Ice cream ice cream

38
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,599
What's wrong with the two babies? This is

39
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:46,120
They want to eat ice cream

40
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,159
Then take them to eat ice cream

41
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,199
Go eat ice cream

42
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,360

00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:53,120

44
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:04,840
Auntie, where's my dad

45
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,479
To join the elderly choir

46
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:12,080
It is said that

47
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,840
You rejected that little news

48
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:18,400
You all know

49
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:20,240
I saw Aunt Luo

50
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:23,439
Said Xiaowen took you to the wedding room

51
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:24,599
So sincere

52
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,960
Why don't you cherish it so much

53
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:28,919
I am not the same person with him

54
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,240
Are you fine or stupid

55
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:33,759
Just sniff this condition

56
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:34,400
You do not want

57
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:35,840
Many people are rushing to get it

58
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,800
Everyone thinks differently

59
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,280
I plan for you

60
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:43,680
You are so old

61
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:44,879
Don't get married again

62
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,719
In the future only

63
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:47,080
Find those divorced

64
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,439
Aunt

65
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:53,520
I know you are doing me good

66
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,319
But my own business

67
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,360
I know

68
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,560
look at you

69
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:59,199
So smart

70
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,879
Just don't understand

71
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,240
Fortunately

72
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,159
I kept one hand

73
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,719
weekend

74
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,599
You go meet that

75
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,080
Uncle Jiang's nephew

76
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,039
and also

77
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,399
Student of Chairman Tong

78
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,199
I see

79
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,839
Conditions are good

80
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,079
What do you think

81
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:36,920
Let's eat together tonight

82
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,800
I want to accompany my parents tonight

83
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:41,959
Are you with your parents every day

84
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,120
Let the beautiful family stay alone

85
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,360
Lonely, empty, cold and dangerous

86
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,839
Just shut up you

87
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:50,879
I haven't seen your parents yet

88
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:52,399
No

89
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:55,560
Liu Yang

90
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,839
You speak so grounded

91
00:04:59,079 --> 00:04:59,720
Can you

92
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,360
Let's talk something poetic

93
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,079
Ignore him

94
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:05,759
Maybe she is scared

95
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:07,279
After all, your two situations

96
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:08,120
Quite special

97
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,839
You can't make her afraid

98
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,959
Woman's courage

99
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:16,240
All given by men

100
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:21,920
As long as you give me an affirmation

101
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:26,560
My love has meaning

102
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:29,079
so

103
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,360
You should be

104
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,439
Sing more karaoke

105
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:32,839
Let's go

106
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:35,199
Go singing tonight

107
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I want to bring Yuwei

108
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,920
How to bring children every day

109
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,560
Zhizhi is busy and I am free

110
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,680
You two

111
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,279
Did you get divorced?

112
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,199
Should I take my divorce certificate

113
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,160
Show it to you

114
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:53,279
You wear a wedding ring every day

115
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,240
Staring like this

116
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,480
How do I think you treat Zhizhi

117
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,079
I'm more concerned than before

118
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,680
you are right

119
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:02,560
I am right now to Zhizhi

120
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,839
This is how it feels

121
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,720
What about her to you

122
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,040
Less and less caring

123
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:15,720
That won't work

124
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,399
You have the means

125
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:20,639
What means

126
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:23,800
What does Zhizhi like

127
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,319
There was no rose at the beginning

128
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,879
No diamond ring

129
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:33,920
I'm so confused

130
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,959
Married you

131
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,560
You don't like these

132
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,360
How can women not like these

133
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,480
Yes

134
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,199
I should make up for her

135
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,079
propose

136
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,839
I can help you plan

137
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:52,240
Yes, let Yiming go

138
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,639
Yiming's proposal is the most experienced

139
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:54,279
is not it

140
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:55,920
I said if you can't speak

141
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,879
Can you just stop talking

142
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:57,959
I serve, I serve, I serve

143
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:58,959
Don't talk if you can't speak

144
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,759
Ok

145
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:00,959
Surrender

146
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:02,399
Surrender

147
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,199
This kid coughs

148
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:12,680
Can't stop cough first

149
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,839
Should first resolve phlegm

150
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:14,920
right

151
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,680
What i said

152
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,000
Every time this Susan coughs

153
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,839
It's been a long time

154
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,439
It turned out that the medicine was not given

155
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:20,680
Look back

156
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:22,040
I use some Yuwei

157
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,639
I will send you more symptomatic medicine

158
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,920
If Susan coughs again

159
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,199
You give her a try first

160
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,399
That's great

161
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:30,240
father

162
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,000
what happened

163
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,240
Get the clothes on

Come, help her get it

170
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:55,959
good or not

171
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,519
Come, take off your clothes

172
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:06,560
Come, reach out

173
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,279
okay

174
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:11,319
Give me milk tea

175
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:14,120
Thank you

176
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,519
Here, give me ice cream

177
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:24,480
So it won't

178
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:25,240
Stained clothes

179
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:26,959
Me too me too

180
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:27,519

Come

182
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,560
Okay, thank you

183
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:31,839
Come

184
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,519
Got it wrong

185
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:46,679
Okay, thank you

186
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:52,759
Slow down

187
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,519
You have a good idea

188
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:01,720
Just have more life experience

189
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,279
Uncle, yes

190
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:08,840
Susan and I went to the door to watch the fish

191
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:09,759
sure

192
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:10,919
But can't go out

193
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,360
Oh, I see

194
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,320
Ah so good

195
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:15,600
I will take you there

196
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,080
Ok

197
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:17,120
Thank you

198
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:17,879
You're welcome

199
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,879
I just saw you answer the phone

200
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:24,759
Particularly unhappy

201
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,440
It's work

202
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:28,679
Yes

203
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:29,840
Susan's mother

204
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,080
she was

205
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,480
Getting married soon

206
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,240
Let Susan be a flower girl for her

207
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,679
I didn't agree. I quarreled a few words

208
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,759
How long have you been divorced

209
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:45,080
Three years

210
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,120
When Susan was one year old

211
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:48,799
She left with a foreigner

212
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,240
You take the kids alone

213
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,279
It's not easy

214
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:55,440
Very hard

215
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,039
I'm fine

216
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,320
But just think about it

217
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,679
A little wronged Susan

218
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,159
As long as the child does not lack love

219
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,480
Will not feel wronged

220
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,000
is it

221
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:10,840
What you say

222
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:12,480
I feel quite relieved

223
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,720
I am so relieved of myself

224
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:15,679
Thank you

225
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:17,240
how about you

226
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,399
Yes

227
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:19,600
Because of divorce

228
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,320
Nothing

229
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,039
It's okay if you don't want to answer

230
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:25,919
I shouldn't ask

231
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:29,639
nor

232
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,159
I'm not unwilling to say

233
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:36,120
On the surface

234
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:38,480
I broke up with her father

235
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:40,080
Because of the third party

236
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:43,399
But now I feel more and more

237
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:44,919
I am in marriage

238
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:46,039
There are also many problems

239
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:48,240
I think you are perfect

240
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:52,639
Me back then

241
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,879
I just want to be a good mother

242
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,480
Good wife

243
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:58,200
But i forgot

244
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,399
be the best you can be

245
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:01,960
until one day

246
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:03,279
All questions

247
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,639
You have to carry it by yourself

248
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,000
I just found

249
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,120
How powerless I am

250
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:10,519
no way

251
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,360
Everything has to start over

252
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:14,840
Then you alone

253
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:17,120
This is busy with work and with children

254
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:19,399
Actually it's not easy

255
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:20,840
Yes

256
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,600
Work pressure

257
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:25,159
Still scolded by customers

258
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,440
I'll apologize to you again

259
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:30,840
just kidding

260
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:33,480
Didn't stress you today?

261
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,960
Very happy today

262
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:35,600
Ok

263
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,240
I am also very happy

264
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,600
Li Siyu, where are you?

265
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:10,320
Sister, I miss you so much

266
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:20,759
I don't have a fish pond

267
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,879
I only have this beach

268
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:26,039
Do me on the beach

269
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,159
The only one

270
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,000
Is the sand sculpture good?

271
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,200
Sand sculpture

272
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,080
Li Siyu

273
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:48,440
Where is Li Siyu

274
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,799
do you know

275
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:51,320
I miss you so much

276
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,559
Miss you so much

277
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:56,919
I waited too anxiously

278
00:12:56,919 --> 00:12:58,000
Li Siyu

279
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:00,840
You show up soon

280
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:03,120
Neuropathy

281
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:07,840
Li Siyu

282
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:10,159
I will be your cold spirit

283
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,240
I have all the materials ready for you

284
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,240
When are you

285
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,519
Come hug me

286
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,360
Come hug me

287
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,320
scared me

288
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,240
Why are you here

289
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:56,919
Although the angel investment

290
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,200
Rarely more than 30%

291
00:13:59,320 --> 00:13:59,960
But i will

292
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,240
Give you 100% of mine

293
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:03,519
What do you mean

294
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,000
I don't care about your relationship

295
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,840
How is it defined

296
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:08,000
I want to tell you now

297
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:10,120
I was serious

298
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:12,480
I'm so serious

299
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:13,759
I'm serious enough to hope

300
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,960
Parents’ approval and blessing

301
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,080
I'm serious

302
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,200
Hope this relationship belongs

303
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:19,960
Forever

304
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:26,639
thank you

305
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:28,480
me too

306
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:30,120
Ziru

307
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,039
I stand with you

308
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,080
No matter what

309
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,039
I don't have any comparability

310
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:40,039
But one thing

311
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,440
I will never be less than you

312
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:45,039
Is my sincerity

313
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:49,679
Do not

314
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:52,600
Yes i have my problem

315
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,600
If you are worried

316
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,000
The age difference between the two of us

317
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:56,879
Worry about opinions between parents

318
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:57,919
I can now

319
00:14:57,919 --> 00:14:58,879
Tell you clearly

320
00:14:58,879 --> 00:14:59,720
I do not care

321
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,720
Even if

322
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:04,000
Is the closest person

323
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,159
Can't be shaken

324
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:07,039
My feelings for you

325
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:25,440
In a few days

326
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,799
My parents are leaving Shanghai

327
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:31,720
Before they go

328
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:33,840
I want to take them to a meal

329
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,919
Authentic Shanghai cuisine

330
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,600
I will send you the address when I arrive

331
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:44,080
It would be best if you can come

332
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:48,600
It's okay if you don't come

333
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:50,799
I respect your choice

334
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,320
it is good

335
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:01,600
let me see

336
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:09,840
Hey

337
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:11,600
You didn't work overtime today

338
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,200
Do you think I am Zhang Zhizhi

339
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,279
Work overtime every day

340
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,200
What are you doing

341
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,039
Keeping an empty boudoir alone, emptiness, loneliness and cold

342
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,519
He Mu who didn't talk to you

343
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,399
In one piece

344
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:24,159
People ten fifteen

345
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:25,200
Going to bed

346
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,440
I can't disturb people

347
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,000
How are you and xiaowen

348
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:30,559
Already made it clear

349
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,519
So fast

350
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:34,440
I have always been an activist

351
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:36,240
Don't be proud

352
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:38,320
I listened to my mother

353
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:39,399
She has arranged for you

354
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:40,600
Bigger event

355
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,600
Did you say

356
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,159
Birthday party for three uncles and granddaughters

357
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:46,159
Correct

358
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,360
I'm too hard, I'm so sad

359
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
And your worries about Li Siyu

360
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,639
old

361
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,120
Help me find a way

362
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:01,840
You

363
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:03,960
Really find a boyfriend

364
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,920
It disrupted my mom's plan

365
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,720
Where to find

366
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:08,799
That's harder

367
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,960
I didn't say really looking for it

368
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,480
You listen to me

369
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,240
There must be a way

370
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,759
What do you mean

371
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,480
By the time

372
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,640
I will send Lei Haowen to you

373
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,519
Isn't it enough?

374
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,680
It's easy for you

375
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,119
Lei Haowen listen to you

376
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,240
Don't care about this

377
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,839
Socks look good

378
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,559
Quite good looking

379
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,640
Give me a pair too

380
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:34,079
what

381
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:37,680
I just finished installing your ex boyfriend

382
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,680
I want to give Li Siyu again

383
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,720
Pretend boyfriend

384
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:43,160
Can you change someone

385
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,480
Wool

386
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,799
I can't have a lamb

387
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:46,440
is not it

388
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:48,880
Who will let you act well?

389
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,880
You come less

390
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,119
You are

391
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:53,920
The actor left behind

392
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,319
Oscar

393
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:57,000
I am still

394
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,519
What about the old drama with its own traffic

395
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,400
exactly

396
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,960
You, play rich second generation

397
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,480
More like a rich second generation

398
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:06,519
Didn't you say i am

399
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:07,599
Is it domestic counterfeit goods?

400
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,920
You already upgraded

401
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:12,680
Come on

402
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:15,640
Employing people forward, not people facing backward

403
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,200
Talking about people like you

404
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:18,440
Lei Haowen

405
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:20,279
Don't shame you

406
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:21,480
Are you helping me?

407
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:28,480
help

408
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,720
I remember

409
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:32,799
next Friday

410
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:34,880
When the third uncle and granddaughter day

411
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,599
You appear

412
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:37,319
Drive a good car

413
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,960
Start at 500,000

414
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,960
If you don’t have it, you can rent

415
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:43,200
Didn't that Porsche work last time?

416
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,279
No way, too exaggerated

417
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:46,359
Can't get past my parents

418
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:48,759
Your parents

419
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,160
Li Siyu's parents

420
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,000
You go get another one

421
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,079
Bag with logo

422
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:54,319
But not

423
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:55,480
The kind covered with trademarks

424
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,759
Is there any brand requirement

425
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:01,240
Not too low-key international first-line

426
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:06,119
Car package

427
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:07,680
remember

428
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,839
And your hairstyle and clothes

429
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:12,000
Also need to change a little

430
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,000
And your family background

431
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,960
Need to beautify

432
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,920
How to beautify

433
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:18,759
Young talents, returnees

434
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,319
What to beautify

435
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:21,160
I am not

436
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,200
Young talent

437
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:23,720
Young talent

438
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:24,759
Ok

439
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:27,200
that

440
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:29,079
Your mother is your mother

441
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:30,599
Li Siyu's father is her father

442
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:31,200
right

443
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:33,359
Yes

444
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,599
Come, come, sit down

445
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:46,759
Sit down. Sit down

446
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:48,039
when will you arrive

447
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,880
Come, everyone, sit down. You're welcome

448
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,039
five minutes

449
00:19:56,839 --> 00:19:57,599
sit down

450
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,640
Thinking about rain

451
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,400
Everyone is here, let's serve hot dishes

452
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:08,480
hold on

453
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:09,440
No one has arrived

454
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,599
Who else

455
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,039
My boyfriend

456
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,640
Never heard of it

457
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,960
That's right

458
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
You have friends

459
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:22,720
When did

460
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,480
Why don't we know

461
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,759
I don't even know

462
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,079
Parents don't know

463
00:20:27,319 --> 00:20:28,480
Because not before

464
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,359
Determine the relationship

465
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,559
So there is no

466
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:31,920
Report to elders

467
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,119
Where is he from then

468
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,480
what does he do

469
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,200
How are the economic conditions?

470
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,519
Good person

471
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,559
He will be there soon

472
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,880
Your question

473
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,759
Let him answer

474
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:42,400
it is good

475
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,880
Then we have to take the exam

476
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,000
The elders will check for you

477
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:46,640
it is good

478
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,200
Siyu

479
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:48,279
coming

480
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:49,240
Elders

481
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:50,559
let me introduce

482
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,920
This is

483
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,640
Yes

484
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:54,079
Sorry, elders

485
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:55,000
We are late

486
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,759
I am thinking of rain

487
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:57,039
Grandly introduce

488
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,160
This is

489
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:03,240
Hello, elders

490
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,119
I am Siyu's boyfriend

491
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:05,880
Guan Xiaotang

492
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:08,000
First time meeting, please take care

493
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,319
It's him not him

494
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,440
Have you heard of

495
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,240
Have you heard of

496
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,240
No no

497
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:55,400
it is good

498
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:56,119
Row

499
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:56,839
Sit down

500
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,559
You like to eat

501
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:13,640
What's this

502
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:14,960
I also have one

503
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,880
Ma, give me the bowl

504
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,920
I will serve you some eel

505
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:17,680
it is good

506
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,160
Your mother likes this dish the most

507
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,559
Yes i don't know

508
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:21,480
Less

509
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,000
it is good

510
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:23,960
Heart is too soft

511
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:24,799
Heart is too soft

512
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,400
It seems to be the name

513
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,119
Had eaten

514
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:28,400
Is it your own name?

515
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:29,319
it is good

516
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:30,119
Heart is too soft

517
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,799
You give me the teacup

518
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:33,160
You have more soup

519
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:33,920
Drink less drinks

520
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,559
Ah it's too sweet

521
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:35,160
it is good

522
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,400
It's gone

523
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,279
what happened

524
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:51,640
Surprised or not surprised

525
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,279
How could it be Guan Xiaotang

526
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,440
Lei Haowen's acting is too exaggerated

527
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,359
Don't worry

528
00:22:57,359 --> 00:22:58,480
I changed him

529
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:00,400
I can't find anyone else temporarily

530
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:01,519
How did you find him

531
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,319
He added my WeChat

532
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:05,359
Why would he add you to WeChat

533
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,680
He is a great technologist

534
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,400
It’s not easy to add me to WeChat

535
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:11,960
You know i'm hiding from him

536
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,200
Why do you have to call him up?

537
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:15,759
Because i like to fight you

538
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,240
Since childhood

539
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,839
You let me go east, i want to go west

540
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,559

541
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:23,640
I didn't harm you either

542
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:25,640
I did exactly what you asked for

543
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,359
Customized

00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:29,720
Although I'm a little younger

546
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,480
But he is

547
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,240
Very dedicated and passionate

548
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,200
Gu Xiaoling

549
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,359
Don't leave me

550
00:23:36,759 --> 00:23:38,279
How about we video

551
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:39,880
I really want to see

Regenerative asset circulation business

568
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,640
Then after the business got bigger

Siyu

601
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,599
Such good conditions

602
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:37,119
Don't let go

603
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:38,480
I know

604
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,799
Guan Xiaotang, right

605
00:25:41,799 --> 00:25:42,480
Yes

606
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,279
Xiao Tang, this kid

607
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:45,519
How much did my daughter spend

608
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:46,680
Invited you

609
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:48,119
uncle

610
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,920
I am at my own expense

611
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:51,400
take it easy

612
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,440
I won't break through you

613
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:55,279
I'm really not an actor

614
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,960
You can't hide from me

615
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,119
Uncle, even if you are

616
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:00,200
Don't believe my infatuation

617
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,759
Should also believe

618
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:02,839
The charm of your daughter

619
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:14,079
You are not my daughter's food

620
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:16,720
uncle

621
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,559
But life is alive

622
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,759
Don't you have to taste it all

623
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:25,039
This word

624
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:26,480
Appetite for me

625
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,000
They had a good chat

626
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,359
Thinking of rain that

627
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:31,519
I'll give it to aunt and uncle

628
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:32,160
Go back first

629
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:32,839
Windy outside

630
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:33,519
You and Mr. Guan

631
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:35,200
You go and go around there

632
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,400
Right right right next door

633
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,160
There is a park ahead

634
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:39,799
Good good

635
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:40,319
I know

636
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:41,400
That line, uncle and aunt

637
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:42,519
It's windy outside, let's go first

638
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:43,480
Good walk around

00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,160
Pay attention to safety Pay attention to safety

640
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,359
Thinking of rain, then we're leaving too

641
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:45,960
Good good

642
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:46,960
Don't worry, Mr. Guan.

643
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,799
I will give you

Goodbye goodbye

647
00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:51,720
Goodbye, let's go

648
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:53,119
Hurry up

649
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:56,880
Uncle, slow down

650
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:03,960
Still qualified

651
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:09,640
Your beard is too fake

652
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,559
Not sticky original

653
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:14,880
to be frank

654
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:16,079
Where did you graduate

655
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,200
Don't you have my resume

656
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,400
Did you graduate from Central Academy of Fine Arts?

657
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,960
Acting rich second generation is more like Lei Haowen

658
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,160
Who taught it

659
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,839
Not acting original

660
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,720
I don't know you yet

661
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,160
Who borrowed this outfit

662
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,000
And how much is the car to rent?

663
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:37,279
I turn back to WeChat to forward you

664
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:38,960
I don't need money

665
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,359

Go find a little girl

669
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,559
Finished the puppy love first

670
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:56,359
Come find me again

671
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,480
I'm an old driver

672
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,640
Although I look like a little fresh meat

673
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,359
But i have matured i

674
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,680

00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:19,920
I played for a long time in vain

679
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,039
Yiming, is it time?

680
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:26,960

Went to the train station

00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:37,519
It's okay, you are busy, you are busy

719
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:39,640
Yiming, get in the car

gone

728
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:02,559
Slow down

729
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:03,119
Ok

730
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,200
You see, I can't sit down

731
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,200
Looks a lot like

00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,400
What looks like

733
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,160
Come on, enjoy it

734
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:44,440
Sister Li

00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:49,759
Let's play, it suits you more

736
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,839
Just play

737
00:30:55,599 --> 00:30:56,799
Come back to Shanghai with me

00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,400
Since i'm back

739
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,559
Didn't plan to go back

740
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,720
Come on

741
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:06,000
You will be domineering tomorrow

742
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,400
But was bullied in the unit

743
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:08,799
Don't you feel wronged

744
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:09,839
I still feel embarrassed

745
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:12,519
Nice

746
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,960
Did you do it

747
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,480
We just met

748
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,640
You beat and scolded me

749
00:31:17,079 --> 00:31:18,240
Unchangeable

750
00:31:18,519 --> 00:31:20,000
That's your true shape

751
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:26,079
I know

752
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,359
You have been unable to make it through

753
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:30,079
I'm calling and Lubao's Kaner

754
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:32,359
Don't you just destroy the two companies?

755
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,519
It's ok

756
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:35,720
Let's break a few more companies later

757
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:36,960
I'm not so uncomfortable

758
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,920
Do you want to be beaten again?

759
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:44,359
look

760
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:45,759
Murderous

761
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:47,480
This is you

762
00:31:55,759 --> 00:31:56,480

00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:59,079
Xiao Wang that girl is

764
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:00,960
Didn’t you say it?

765
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,279
Can i ask

766
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:05,039
Not talking

767
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,920
Just ask if you want

768
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,079
Where is Xiao Wang from?

769
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:12,279
What do her parents do

770
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:14,599
Yiming, this gift

771
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,440
But it's on my heart

772
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:23,240
The inscription on the inscription of Liquan in Jiucheng Palace

773
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,519
I like this bracelet so much

774
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,559
The condition is really good

775
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,680

00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:38,079
The inscription on the inscription of Liquan in Jiucheng Palace

777
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,799
I have been thinking about it for a long time

778
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:42,160
It's not bad

779
00:32:42,279 --> 00:32:43,079

My parents' preferences

00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:17,920
I'm in your circle of friends

788
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,279
Look at the photos you sent

00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:23,640
Your mother's jewelry is all jade

791
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:25,720
Don't know if i guessed right

792
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,759
you guessed right

793
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:33,759
My parents love it

794
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,599
Also very happy

795
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:41,240
You actually

796
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,319
There won't be much

797
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,880
The way you send them

798
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,119
Put a

799
00:33:47,799 --> 00:33:49,039
May be awkward meeting

800
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:49,920
Become very brief

801
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:52,359
But also left them

802
00:33:52,359 --> 00:33:53,240
deep impression

803
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,359
Are you blaming me

804
00:34:06,759 --> 00:34:07,480
Yiming

805
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:09,960
I can predict

806
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,360
The trend of a stock

807
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,760
Can also control many things

808
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,119
But for feelings

809
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:19,400
I really don't have the ability

810
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,119
I'm not sure

811
00:34:25,518 --> 00:34:26,158
Yiming

812
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,519
I don't care

813
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,320
I don't want to have a future with you

814
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,639
I don't know what to do

815
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:55,239
I know

816
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,679
Actually in love

817
00:35:02,119 --> 00:35:03,440
I also have a lot of fear

818
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:06,280
We can learn together

819
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,239
work together

820
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:15,360
Ok we work hard together

821
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,079
I hope that one day

822
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,159
We can calmly

823
00:35:33,159 --> 00:35:34,000
Meet them

824
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:40,400
Then you have to give me some time

825
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:43,800
it is good

826
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:47,239
Yiming

827
00:35:49,639 --> 00:35:50,679
I hope you let go

828
00:35:50,679 --> 00:35:52,079
Unnecessary self-esteem

829
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,760
Help me rebuild the Emerald brand

830
00:35:56,119 --> 00:35:56,840
Alright

831
00:36:03,559 --> 00:36:04,239
it is good

832
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,599
Auntie, take so many things

833
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:14,400
Hold hold

834
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,519
Too much to eat

835
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:16,199
You put it there, auntie

836
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:16,880
We do it ourselves

837
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,400
We do it ourselves

838
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,079
Take it back

839
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:19,599
You take it in the car and eat slowly

840
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,000
Are the characteristics of our place

841
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:22,280
This is for Xiaoling

842
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,559
Xiaoling, let me come, let me come

843
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:25,000
I sent it to Xiaoling

844
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:26,159
thank you

845
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:27,320
You help me ask Xiaoling

846
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,159
When is she

847
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:29,400
I should bring my boyfriend back

848
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,440
let us see

849
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,280
Yes, since it's set

850
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:33,719
Should have come long ago

851
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:34,880
Meet this father-in-law

852
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,400
Yes

853
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:36,360
deal

854
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:37,960
Siyu said

855
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,719
That man has already proposed

856
00:36:40,119 --> 00:36:41,320
Xiaoling also agreed

857
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,480
Aunt dad

858
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,119
That one

859
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:45,320
Let's talk about Xiaoling

860
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:47,280
Stop walking in traffic jam

861
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,920
Yes yes yes you guys go

862
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,159
Be careful on the road

863
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:51,119
Drive slowly on the road

864
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:52,199
Then we go first

865
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:52,880
Uncle and aunt

866
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,719
Pay attention to your body

867
00:36:53,719 --> 00:36:54,480
be careful

868
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,639
I will see you again

869
00:36:55,639 --> 00:36:56,280
it is good

870
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:56,920
Bye bye thinking rain

871
00:36:57,239 --> 00:36:58,159
Drive slowly

872
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,519
Money or not are second

873
00:37:06,519 --> 00:37:08,400
The most important thing is to be nice to you

874
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,320
Although this Xiao Tang is a few years younger than you

875
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:12,880
But I know it hurts

876
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,719
Also good to you

877
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,840
Ok, deal

878
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:16,280
Auntie, listen to you

879
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:19,599
But he is in Shanghai

880
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:20,400
You are here

881
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,840
What are you going to do

882
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:24,199
In the future

883
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,199
Talk about it later

884
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,519
That won't work

885
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,800
This is a big deal

886
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,440
You said

887
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:31,280
Guan Xiaotang

888
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,039
Not mature yet

889
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:35,639
Siyu and that Xiao Tang are fine

890
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:38,800
That's for you

891
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,960
What do you mean

892
00:37:40,679 --> 00:37:41,840
Tell me old man

893
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:43,480
Is it three missing one?

894
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,880
I'm coming i'm coming

895
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,119
Tell me this dead old man

896
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:51,880
Siyu, I think it's good

897
00:37:52,039 --> 00:37:53,360
Auntie, let's go back first

898
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:56,559
You want to tell me what's going on

899
00:37:56,679 --> 00:37:58,599
I really like this kid

900
00:37:58,599 --> 00:37:59,360
You like it

901
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,159
Brother Lei, can you drive slowly

902
00:38:09,239 --> 00:38:10,360
I'm afraid of death, Brother Lei

903
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,079
I'm still young, Brother Lei

904
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,079
I have billions of property to inherit

905
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:14,639
Lei Ge

906
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:17,960
parking

907
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:30,760
Let me drive

908
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,159
What are you going to do, Brother Lei

909
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:05,920
I do not know either

910
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:08,199
When is it

911
00:39:08,199 --> 00:39:09,280
Don't know what to do

912
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,480
Bright killer

913
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,159
No killer

914
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,719
who said it

915
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,679
Really invincible

916
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,199
Take a step back

917
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:40,039
A little backward a little backward

918
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:48,119
No more no more

919
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:54,599
Play with you two

920
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,000
A little bit backward, win or not

921
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:11,079
The two of them can have fun

922
00:40:11,559 --> 00:40:12,880
Yeah rare

923
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:18,599
Mother Yuwei

924
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,320
Ok

925
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:21,719
Do you think

926
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,159
Actually we two

927
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:25,159
Also quite agreeable

928
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:28,360
Maybe because of the child

929
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,880
The personality is quite similar, right?

930
00:40:39,559 --> 00:40:41,079
I'll just say something

931
00:40:43,159 --> 00:40:44,280
With you

932
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:48,000
I feel particularly at ease

933
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:49,880
Very warm

934
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:55,760
Last time I came back from Disney

935
00:40:56,559 --> 00:40:57,719
I have been thinking about

936
00:40:57,719 --> 00:40:58,519
one question

937
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,119
If the four of us can

938
00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:05,559
If you start a family

939
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,559
Should be very happy

940
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:12,480
What do you think

941
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:29,639
Susan Papa

942
00:41:29,639 --> 00:41:31,199
You can ask me to go

943
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:33,320
If you can

944
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,360
I call you Zhizhi

945
00:41:39,159 --> 00:41:39,840
I

946
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:41,400
Haven't considered

947
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,320
this problem

948
00:41:42,719 --> 00:41:44,159
The reason i am today

949
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:45,320
Ask this question

950
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:47,360
I just want to give you time to think about it

951
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,000
but

952
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,760
Don't worry about answering me

953
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:57,280
Take a moment to think about it

954
00:41:57,679 --> 00:41:58,440
Enough

955
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,039
May I

956
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,079
Goodbye

957
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:20,679
Goodbye

958
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,440
Xiaoling

959
00:42:33,639 --> 00:42:34,320
Almost

960
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,800
Forgot to give this to you

961
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:37,840
what is this

962
00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:39,400
to ensure that

963
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,840
Our mutual rights

964
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:42,800
To ensure that the wedding goes smoothly

965
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:43,679
At the same time guarantee

966
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:45,000
Long-term stability of marriage

967
00:42:45,239 --> 00:42:46,239
I made this

968
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,559
Prenuptial agreement

969
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,400
So heavy

970
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,719
A total of nine chapters and twenty-three items

971
00:42:54,719 --> 00:42:56,159
Three hundred forty-seven entries

972
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:59,000
Includes politics, economy, religion

973
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,159
Emotional health education etc.

974
00:43:00,159 --> 00:43:01,000
every aspect

975
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,280
At the same time before marriage

976
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,599
Stages of marriage

977
00:43:04,599 --> 00:43:05,440
Planned

978
00:43:06,639 --> 00:43:08,880
You say it again

979
00:43:09,679 --> 00:43:11,639
I hope to be able to prepare before the wedding

980
00:43:11,639 --> 00:43:13,199
Sign this agreement

981
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,800
Are you getting married or establishing diplomatic relations?

982
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:19,480
You take a look

983
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:20,480
I hope

984
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,920
On the next date

985
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:22,920
To this agreement

986
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:24,239
Communicate and communicate

987
00:43:26,199 --> 00:43:27,599
Then next Wednesday night

988
00:43:27,639 --> 00:43:28,599
0.2625

989
00:43:28,679 --> 00:43:29,840
Still that western restaurant

990
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:30,679
See you at the old place

991
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:32,840
Ok

992
00:43:58,880 --> 00:43:59,519
What are you doing

993
00:43:59,519 --> 00:44:01,119
Frightened me

994
00:44:03,239 --> 00:44:04,119
You are getting married

995
00:44:06,159 --> 00:44:07,000
you've been drinking

996
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:09,719
you answer me first

997
00:44:10,639 --> 00:44:11,840
What's up with you

998
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:12,519
you can not

999
00:44:12,519 --> 00:44:13,840
Marry that robot

1000
00:44:14,519 --> 00:44:15,280
why

1001
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:16,960
because I like you

1002
00:44:19,639 --> 00:44:21,280
But i don't like you

1003
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,440
But you don't like him at all

1004
00:44:28,679 --> 00:44:30,079
Even if i don't like him

1005
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,480
But it's impossible for me and you

1006
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:33,800
How impossible

1007
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:36,119
When you are in a bad mood

1008
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:37,400
I can drink with you

1009
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:38,519
You are in trouble

1010
00:44:38,519 --> 00:44:39,719
I can help you

1011
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:41,360
You stay with me

1012
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:43,000
You can wear slippers without makeup

1013
00:44:44,039 --> 00:44:45,159
I can make you laugh

1014
00:44:45,639 --> 00:44:46,960
I'll beat and scold as you like

1015
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,119
When you need me

1016
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:49,719
I won't shut down and sleep at all

1017
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:57,599
Do you have money

1018
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:00,440
you have

1019
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:01,800
Is it a company valued at several hundred million?

1020
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:05,320
Can you give me a sense of security

1021
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,159
I have no money now

1022
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:08,480
But i will have

1023
00:45:09,079 --> 00:45:09,840
I'm tired

1024
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:11,719
I want to rest

1025
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:12,400

Don't you say today

1029
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:17,559
You just can't go

1030
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:18,639
I don't want to follow one

1031
00:45:18,639 --> 00:45:20,000
Drunk man talking

00:45:23,639 --> 00:45:24,320
