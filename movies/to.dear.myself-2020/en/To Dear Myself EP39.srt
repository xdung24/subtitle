# Google translate version for your reference #

2
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:35,079
I'm tired

3
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,959
I want to rest

4
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:37,640
Xiaoling

5
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:39,519
Xiaoling

6
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:41,239
what are you doing

7
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,799
Today you can't leave without saying

8
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:43,879
I don't want to follow one

9
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:45,239
Drunk man talking

10
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:45,760
Xiaoling

11
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,920
Some things i don't get drunk

12
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,120
I can't tell you

13
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:49,560
Gu Xiaoling

14
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,400
I love you Gu Xiaoling

15
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,920
Can you be with me

16
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,840
You let go

17
00:01:58,439 --> 00:01:59,760
But i don't love you

18
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,239
I know

19
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,639
I know you do not love me

20
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,840
You don't love me

21
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,520
in your heart

22
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:24,759
There is no place for me

23
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,080
Not before

24
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,240
Not now

25
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,000
There won't be in the future

26
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,680
Hao Wen

27
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:50,360
I always think of you as

28
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,919
My most important friend

29
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,199
What do i have

30
00:02:58,599 --> 00:02:59,840
Can't tell boyfriend

31
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,120
But i will tell you

32
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:05,520
You in my heart

33
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,199
Not insignificant

34
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:13,159
But i want to marry

35
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:14,120
What kind of person

36
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,639
You always know

37
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:19,120
He Mu

38
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,039
I am married

39
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:01,680
Come in

40
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:05,600
Manager Feng

41
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,519
what's up

42
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,759
Next year's work plan

43
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,720
Finished so soon

44
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,800
I referenced

45
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,439
The department's work plan for the past few years

46
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:17,040
Then made a slight adjustment

47
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,920
The goal set next year is

48
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,000
Revenue from scenic spots increased by 5%

49
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,360
Not bad, good work

50
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,199
What is this again

51
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,079
Talking to the travel agency online platform

52
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:32,279
Offline promotion channels

53
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:33,120
After research

54
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,800
I made another one

55
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,000
New work plan

56
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,199
Made two

57
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,680
If you reintegrate the marketing market

58
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,639
I am sure

59
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:43,319
Revenue from scenic spots next year

60
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:44,920
At least 80% increase

61
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,240
You are going to make

62
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:51,879
Everyone in the department runs the channel

63
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,120
I recommend

64
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,000
Everyone is responsible for a section

65
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,279
I recommend

66
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,519
Also have night tours

67
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:04,920
I recommend

68
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,120
Xiaoding

69
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,920
Notify everyone of the afternoon meeting

70
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,600
Discuss what Li Siyu did

71
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,040
Department's work plan for next year

72
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,560
To everyone

73
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:22,879
Then I will print a few more copies

74
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:23,600
No no no

75
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:24,920
still is

76
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,160
Print this

77
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:29,079
This is old

78
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:30,959
Let's discuss this

79
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,040
why

80
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,360
According to the plan of the head office

81
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,959
And our own future development

82
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,879
While developing

83
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:40,959
Consideration of balance

84
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:42,560
Take this into consideration

85
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,480
Five-Year Plan Ten-Year Plan

86
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,560
Also take this into consideration

87
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,639
Between employees and the company

88
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:49,480
Balanced interest

89
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,480
Also consider

90
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:52,879
How to mobilize the enthusiasm of employees

91
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:54,480
so

92
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,680
Considering this

93
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,839
Continuity of work

94
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:57,519
Us

95
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,240
Still discuss this

96
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:01,800
Thinking about rain

97
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,079
You are very enthusiastic

98
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:05,279
But ah

99
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:06,600
Too immature

100
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:10,560
Then why let me

101
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,079
Make this useless plan

102
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,319
Just to make you

103
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:16,360
Mature as soon as possible

104
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:18,920
Hurry up and print it

105
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,720
you

106
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,439
Li Siyu

107
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:39,240
I take it

108
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,399
Why did Siyu come back so early?

109
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,480
All right

110
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,040
Nothing

111
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:18,079
Thinking about rain

112
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,000
Go fishing with me

113
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:22,319
Don't want to go

114
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:24,240
must go

115
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,160
Go

116
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,200
Dad, wait a moment, I'll come

117
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,080
okay

118
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:38,320
Come

119
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:40,639
Slow down

120
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:41,159
Ok

121
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,879
Are you wronged in the unit?

122
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,159
No

123
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,080
I know that our unit

124
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,480
Then you stayed for a lifetime

125
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,240
That suits me right

126
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:10,080
Your character, you can't

127
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,919
Definitely can't stand it

128
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:17,440
I put

129
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:19,039
Manager Feng is offended

130
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,600
You kid

131
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:28,519
You really don't look like me

132
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:29,399
Like your mother

133
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,919
I was scared of my mother when I was young

134
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:32,679
I am also afraid

135
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:34,840
I don't want

136
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,600
Like her

137
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,399
But in your bones

138
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,240
Still more like her

139
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:46,279
So strong

140
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,919
Combative love is true

141
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,360
Actually I'm back this time

142
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:53,759
Just don't want

143
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:54,919
Be yourself again

144
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,759
This can't be for you

145
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,639
A person born

146
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:01,919
What kind of character

147
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,600
Can't change

148
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:07,000
When you were young

149
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,440
Once the Olympiad took third place

150
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,320
Your mother beat you

151
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:14,639
And punished you not to eat

152
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,919
I love you

153
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,720
I'll take you out to eat noodles secretly

154
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:20,919
let me tell you

155
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:23,799
I won’t read Olympiad in the future

156
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,559
You refuse me with one bite

157
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,080
Crying and calling your mother cruel

158
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,039
And swear to me

159
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:32,759
next time

160
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:34,399
I must take the first place

161
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:37,360
There is this

162
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,159
Kid like you

163
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,440
Even if it is by someone

164
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,879
Beaten up

165
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,120
Pain of course it hurts

166
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,240
But if I don’t let you play

167
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,200
I won't let you fight

168
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:52,919
You hurt more

169
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,559
what do you mean

170
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,879
I should still work hard

171
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,559
I didn't say what should be

172
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,399
I just said

173
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,279
What environment is your personality suitable for

174
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,200
Let's go back

175
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:22,480
Go back to shanghai

176
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:27,320
I can work hard here too

177
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,600
Two days ago

178
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,200
I just invited Lao Zhai to dinner

179
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:33,720
These two days it looks like

180
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,240
I'm going to invite Lao Feng to dinner again

181
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:36,919
You

182
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:38,639
Fighting like you

183
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,799
Love more true character

184
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,600
You stay two more days

185
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,440
The good character that I have accumulated all my life

186
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,039
Good popularity

187
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,919
I lost you all

188
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,480
dad

189
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,519
Let's be one

190
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:54,200
Big fart

191
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,240
See you when you look up

192
00:11:57,559 --> 00:11:59,159
If you offend someone

193
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,159
I will go out with your aunt

194
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:02,279
Met someone

195
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:04,279
Are embarrassed to say hello

196
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,440
Shanghai is different

197
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,559
The size of Shanghai

198
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:08,960
This one

199
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,320
If you offend someone

200
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:12,159
Xuhui District can't wait anymore

201
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:13,639
Let's go to Jing'an District

202
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,120
Can't wait in Jing'an District

203
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,360
Let's go to Huangpu District

204
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,279
Pudong New Area

205
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,440
Never see forever

206
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:22,679
But I want to accompany you more

207
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:24,639
Ok

208
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:28,600
If you can change your character

209
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,759
Stop fighting

210
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,399
Like me

211
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,440
I'm happy with anyone

212
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:37,120
Can stay with me every day

213
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:38,679
Of course i am happy

214
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,840
But you can't change it

215
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:47,120
Sulking every day

216
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,120
Unhappy every day

217
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:53,600
I feel bad for you

218
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:07,279
Me, me, I can explain it

219
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,120
I didn't mean to rush you

220
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:13,440
I hope you can find one

221
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,039
More suitable for your character

222
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:17,200
Living place

223
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:19,399
That way you will be happy

224
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,600
Thanks dad

225
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:27,919
I know

226
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,320
I got goose bumps

227
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,960
Why are you polite to me

228
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,000
dad

229
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,600
Ok

230
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,559
I want to ask you a question

231
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:46,960
Uh you say

232
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:54,039
Have you loved my mom

233
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:02,840
Your mother is so good

234
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,639
Who doesn't love

235
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,000
Then why

236
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:10,039
After my mom left

237
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,240
Only a few months

238
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:14,159
You are married again

239
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:27,679
When your mom left

240
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,600
You are only twelve years old

241
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,120
It is the most in need of care

242
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:37,039
Age most in need of guidance

243
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,720
At that time

244
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,879
I really do not know

245
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:43,600
How to teach you

246
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:46,799
Just happen to others

247
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:48,600
Introduced me to your aunt

248
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:53,120
I remember the first time I met

249
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:55,559
She asked me

250
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,759
What flavor do you like

251
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,399
I made a lot of food for you later

252
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:03,919
Let me bring you

253
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:08,080
I decided

254
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,120
This woman

255
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:13,519
Will be nice to you

256
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,080
So you are for me

257
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:20,000
That's not all

258
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,200
Also for myself

259
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,519
Your aunt

260
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:29,440
It's the opposite of your mom

261
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:31,919
She didn't ask me at all

262
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:39,000
Thinking about rain

263
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,080
I love you mom

264
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:48,320
But really

265
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,639
Your aunt

266
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,919
Maybe more suitable for me

267
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:01,919
dad

268
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,559
You actually understand everything

269
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:07,879
I'm not stupid

270
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:10,519
I just don't want to make progress

271
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,320
Actually

272
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,440
I have never forgotten your mother

273
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,080
But life has to go on

274
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:54,000
Come back

275
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,240
We are back

276
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,639
How are the results

277
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,480
Eat fish at night eat fish eat fish

278
00:16:58,759 --> 00:16:59,840
Great

279
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,639
None

280
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,799
You kid

281
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:03,960
You dead old man

282
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,160
Thinking about rain

283
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,880
Your Uncle Zhou called

284
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,519
Say if you are in the marketing department

285
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:11,440
Unhappy

286
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,400
Change your department

287
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,160
No need, auntie

288
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,799
I am going back to Shanghai

289
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,519
Back to shanghai

290
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:18,920
Don't look at me

291
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,759
Not my idea

292
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,000
She wants to leave

293
00:17:21,118 --> 00:17:22,118
Come come come give me

294
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,200
Because of Xiao Tang

295
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:30,240
No, I just want to go back

296
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,720
What's wrong at home

297
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,680
Everywhere at home

298
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:37,079
But in shanghai

299
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:38,680
I am more open

300
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:40,839
You say you don't want to go

301
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,839
Yes, I thought

302
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:45,960
Don't go

303
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,359
But now i finally know

304
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,359
Who I am and what do I want

305
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,880
Where is better for me

306
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,039
Let her go

307
00:17:57,319 --> 00:17:58,440
You can't keep her

308
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:01,000
I understand the truth

309
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,079
but

310
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:06,720
Aunt

311
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:09,960
Thank you for taking care of me for so many years

312
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:11,279
Take care of my dad

313
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:12,960
What is this

314
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:17,119
Wait a few more years when I go back

315
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:19,799
Save enough money to buy a big house

316
00:18:20,359 --> 00:18:21,400
Just pick you up with my dad

317
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,240
To Shanghai together

318
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,799
At that time

319
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:25,160
You can see me every day

320
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:26,079
See Xiaoling

321
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,240
Good good

322
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,319
mom

323
00:18:52,279 --> 00:18:53,000
mom

324
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,759
daughter

325
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,039
dad

326
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:22,240
Ok

327
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,200
I will go back tomorrow

328
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:27,880
it is good

329
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:30,920
child

330
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,279
If your mother is here

331
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:35,440
She would definitely say

332
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:38,039
Go go fight

333
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,960
But i want to say

334
00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:44,400
Don't care too much about success or failure

335
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,720
And result

336
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:49,359
Don't care how much money you make

337
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:50,920
What size house did you buy

338
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,640
Happiness is the most important thing

339
00:19:58,039 --> 00:19:59,200
enjoy it

340
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,079
The process of struggle

341
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,799
Savor the joy of struggle

342
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,119
This is the most important

343
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:10,480
I understand

344
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,799
Be careful

345
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,079
Come

346
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,480
Zhizhi, wait a minute

347
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,400
Niuniu

348
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,880
Niuniu mom, help me take a look

349
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,200
For you

350
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,480
what is this

351
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,400
You open it in a while

352
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,039
Just know

353
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:38,880
it is good

354
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,519
gone

355
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:40,640
be careful

356
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,119
Ok

357
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,440
Hey

358
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,359
Hey

359
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,720
What is my proposal to you before

360
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:12,839
You never have

361
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,039
Reply me formally

362
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:14,960
I'm afraid you think

363
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,119
I just said it casually

364
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:17,559
and so

365
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,039
Bought this gift

366
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,599
Are you proposing

367
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:23,799
Yes

368
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:26,599
Zhizhi

369
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:28,880
Please marry me

370
00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:30,839
Be my wife

371
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:32,880
Be Susan's mother

372
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,359
You make me think

373
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:39,640
good. I'll wait for you

374
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,559
it is good

375
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,519
came back

376
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:14,039
Yu Wei

377
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,799
It's father and mother

378
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:46,680
Zhizhi

379
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:48,279
Sorry

380
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,359
Remember the first time I saw you

381
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,599
I feel you are so pure

382
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:53,480
Very warm

383
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,440
I thought

384
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,960
If I can live with you forever

385
00:22:58,359 --> 00:23:00,240
I will feel at ease and happy

386
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,359
My dream come true

387
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:04,200
Marry you

388
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:07,400
I was too poor then

389
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:10,440
No wedding no wedding reception

390
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:11,920
Even a wedding photo

391
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,920
I can't give you

392
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,920
But you don't have a complaint

393
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,559
Instead tell me

394
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,440
You are satisfied and happy

395
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:24,400
One year later

396
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:26,799
You gave me another one

397
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,480
The cutest daughter in the world

398
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:30,319
You make me a lot more

399
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:31,200
New experience

400
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:33,039
Also make my life

401
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:34,319
More complete

402
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:36,920
Is this me

403
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,240
however

404
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:47,759
I don't know the blessing

405
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:50,599
I only see myself running

406
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,079
Ignore your fatigue

407
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,200
I only feel my pressure

408
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,480
I can't see your contribution

409
00:23:58,839 --> 00:23:59,599
at last

410
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:02,119
One day i committed

411
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:03,160
Wrong

412
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,160
On the day of losing

413
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,119
I just knew

414
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,240
I used to

415
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,880
What kind of happiness have you had

416
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:16,839
Zhizhi

417
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,039
I dare not beg your forgiveness

418
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,559
I just hope

419
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:25,559
Can have a chance

420
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:27,400
Let me make up

421
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,160
The neglect and hurt you have been

422
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:32,480
I dare not expect

423
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,880
Can go back to the past with you

424
00:24:36,279 --> 00:24:37,480
But i hope

425
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,839
Able to work harder

426
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:41,759
Give you one

427
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:43,240
A sunny future

428
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,559
father

429
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,400
Zhizhi

430
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:27,599
Although long long ago

431
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,519
We met

432
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:34,519
But until today

433
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:38,000
I really understand you

434
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:39,839
Also understand myself

435
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,480
Zhizhi

436
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:52,839
Please marry me again

437
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,039
Mom, promise dad quickly

438
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,559
Hurry up

439
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,359
Liu Yang, stand up first

440
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:09,119
How bad is it to let Yuwei see

441
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:14,559
Dad love mom

442
00:26:15,319 --> 00:26:16,359
What's so bad about this

443
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,279
I just started working now

444
00:26:24,279 --> 00:26:25,160
Busy everyday

445
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,400
Really don't think about it

446
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:35,039
what do you mean

447
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,200
let me

448
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:41,000
Give you some more time

449
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:55,400
that

450
00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:00,640
I leave this first

451
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:32,880
Zhizhi

452
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,799
You can think about it as long as you want

453
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:39,440
I'm waiting for you

454
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:43,960
Regardless of the results you consider

455
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,759
What is it

456
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,319
I accept both

457
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,640
Then you can rest early

458
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,039
Yu Wei

459
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
That dad is gone

460
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,400
Goodbye dad

461
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:19,359
Listen to mother

462
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,240
mom

463
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,799
Why don't you promise dad

464
00:28:57,839 --> 00:28:59,000
Mother doesn't know

465
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,240
Two men

466
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:11,119
Propose to you on the same day

467
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,799
Zhizhi

468
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,799
Charismatic

469
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,480
I have never experienced anything like this

470
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:21,880
at the very beginning

471
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,519
My heart beats

472
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:24,960
Can't breathe

473
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:26,279
I dong dong dong

474
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,960
Flustered

475
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,200
Who are you going to choose?

476
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,000
What do you think

477
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,799
Who diamond election

478
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:42,319
but

479
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,440
Liu Yang is Yuwei's father

480
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:45,759
This is a bonus item

481
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,039
But

482
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:52,440
I don't want to choose

483
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:53,960
why

484
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,680
I think i am

485
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,559
pretty good

486
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,720
Although I'm a little tired from work

487
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,240
But my heart is quiet

488
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,000
I don't want to change

489
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,720
that

490
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:09,039
You have to put these two diamonds

491
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,039
All back

492
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:12,160
What a pity

493
00:30:12,839 --> 00:30:14,079
What a pity

494
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,599
I will earn money later

495
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:17,000
Buy for yourself

496
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,319
That's also a proposal

497
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,799
Then why can't He Mu

498
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:27,119
Send me diamonds

499
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,559
What did he give you

500
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,680
Sleep aid

501
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,079
what

502
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,799
Just this stuff

503
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:40,440
Hypnotic effect is good

504
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,960
Turn to the fifth page every time

505
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,920
I must be unconscious

506
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:52,920
Xiaoling

507
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:55,160
Do you really think

508
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:56,480
Is he suitable

509
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,039
He has what i want

510
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,519
I also have what he wants

511
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:04,759
A match made in heaven

512
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,440
Didn't you pick me up

513
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:18,039
Where's the person? Where's the car

514
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:20,160
I have something temporarily

515
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,240
You are too unreliable

516
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:23,720
I called you Didi

517
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:26,799
number plate

518
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:36,119
Shanghai WN1400

519
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:37,240
I saw

520
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:39,440
sister

521
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:41,559
What a coincidence, sister

522
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:43,200
What a coincidence, a coincidence, I will help you

523
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:44,519
Gu Xiaoling

524
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:46,480
Are you addicted to betraying me?

525
00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:48,599
I was given a set of Lancome

526
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:50,640
I can't refuse

527
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:53,200
Gu Xiaoling

528
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,640
Have a surprise

529
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,079
You a poor boy

530
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:01,319
A set of Lancome

531
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:02,480
You're brainless

532
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,880
Just like this

533
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,720
You haven't beaten me for too long

534
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,200
I'm all itchy

535
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,359
Hit me twice more quickly

536
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,799
You can't blame me

537
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:17,359
Who told you not to reply me

538
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:19,279
You have this money, buy a set

539
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:20,480
Better clothes won't work

540
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,640
You can't have a better meal

541
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,039
Can't you rent a bigger room?

542
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,480
sister

543
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:25,720
Why are you all day long

544
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,000
It's money money money

545
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,359
You are so vulgar

546
00:32:29,319 --> 00:32:31,319
You have time to spend on me

547
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:33,279
Will I die if I fill up?

548
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,720
You find a better job

549
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,640
Will die

550
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,519
But no love

551
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:38,079
Will die too, sister

552
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,720
Then look for someone your age

553
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,519
You waste time with me

554
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:41,079
Waste of money

555
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:42,400
If you don't hurt my heart

556
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,240
I just like challenges

557
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,240
Difficult like you

558
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,519
Where did you take me

General Guan

561
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,440
You haven't returned this car

562
00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:28,319

Although you are a post-eighth-five

Why is it windy like a

And this wallpaper

586
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:14,400
I chose for a long time

587
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:15,639
I spent all my energy this time

588
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:16,880
All spent on decoration

589
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:19,119
What about this company

590
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,159
It’s just been renovated in two days

591
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,000
I didn’t hire many people

592
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,119
The main business is undecided

593
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:26,760
Anyway all

00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:32,840

This is Mr. Li from our company

599
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:37,000
Mr. Li

600
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,239
Come here

601
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,400
Go here

602
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:50,719
how about it

603
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:51,559
This is

604
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:53,000
Our two offices

605
00:34:53,079 --> 00:34:54,320
You can choose any of these two desks

606
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:55,400
Choose

607
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,920
What the hell are you doing

608
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,880
you forgot

609
00:34:59,119 --> 00:34:59,679
I said

610
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:01,199
I want to make a website for you

611
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,559
Guan Xiaotang

612
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,800
Where did you get so much money

613
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,400
Did you borrow usury

614
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:12,920
I do not have

615
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,440
It's all my dad's pocket money

616
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,920
Your dad collects the rags

617
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:19,440
How much money can be

618
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,920
Last month's annual report

619
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,039
Several hundred million

620
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:26,440
RMB

621
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:27,800
USD

622
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,400
He doesn't have that strength

623
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,519
You and my relatives

624
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:34,599
While eating

625
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:36,719
What is said is true

626
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:37,679
Ok

627
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,800
I never lied to you

628
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:41,920
Are you with your grandpa

629
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,960
Grew up picking up tatters

630
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,039
Yes

631
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:46,679
my mother

632
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,480
Remarry

633
00:35:48,519 --> 00:35:49,400
When i was two years old

634
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,480
My dad just give it to me

635
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,639
To my grandpa

636
00:35:51,639 --> 00:35:52,400
I'm just with my grandpa

637
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,360
Pick up the tatters together

638
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,880
Did not you say

639
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,760
Did your dad have a car accident?

640
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,760
My dad went out to start a business

641
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,719
Haven't come back for many years

642
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:02,760
I just think he is gone

643
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:03,760
When he gets older

644
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,639
Take me to him

645
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:05,679
I am more than ten years old

646
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:07,960
The one with a broken arm

647
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:08,840
Transformers

648
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:09,880
Correct

649
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,480
I picked it up and put it together

650
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,639
The car downstairs

651
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,360
When i was eighteen

652
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,000
Birthday gift from my dad

653
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,159
Then why do you go to work by bus

654
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:20,360
I like

655
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,760
Why at my friend's house

656
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,239
Eat and drink

657
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,519
I like it

658
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,440
sister

659
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:34,760
Sister, are you angry?

660
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:36,840
sister

661
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,119
I don't like others to lie to me

662
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,119
I never lied to you

663
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,119
You make me feel stupid

664
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,800
You are so cute

665
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,159
it is good

666
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,480
If you don't like this company

667
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,679
Tell me what you like

668
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,800
I can give it to you

669
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,320
What if i want

670
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,159
I will make my own

671
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:03,920
I just want to give you a gift

672
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,760
Make you happy

673
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:07,679
Do you know when i

674
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:08,480
Happiest

675
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:10,360
When working hard

676
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,119
I am happiest

677
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:12,599
Repeated defeats

678
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:13,679
When clenching your teeth

679
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:14,519
I am happiest

680
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,599
Go through hardships

681
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:16,639
When finally winning

682
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:17,480
I am happiest

683
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,199
Understand

684
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,000
I know

685
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:19,840
I like to surpass others

686
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,679
The feeling of conquering yourself

687
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:21,519
Understand

688
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:22,360
Understand i understand

689
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,280
You understand

690
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,000
Start a company like you

691
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:25,840
Like buying a toy

692
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,239
Rich second generation

693
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:27,360
Never understand

694
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:30,760
Sister, what are you doing

695
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,159
Menopause

696
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:35,480
Guan Xiaotang

697
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,639
This is not what i think

698
00:37:40,679 --> 00:37:41,440
it is good

699
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,400
Even if I did it wrong

700
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,480
Then I love you

701
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:47,440
We two are not suitable

702
00:37:47,719 --> 00:37:48,480
I think we two

703
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,360
Quite appropriate

704
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,159
I am so much older than you

705
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,280
If you are the same age as me

706
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:52,880
I still think you

707
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,239
What about a superficial wayward idiot

708
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:55,119
But I think you are now

709
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:56,559
Superficial Wayward Idiot

710
00:37:56,719 --> 00:37:58,119
I will grow up

711
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:01,920
Perhaps

712
00:38:03,719 --> 00:38:04,639
But i have no confidence

713
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:06,480
I have no patience to wait for you to grow up

714
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,679
If I mature as soon as possible

715
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,239
Will you fall in love with me

716
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,599
People are always there again and again

717
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:18,119
Mature in injury

718
00:38:19,719 --> 00:38:20,480
Xiao Tang

719
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:23,360
I'm afraid you don't have this chance

720
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:26,639
Don't you think

721
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:27,920
Am i hurting right now

722
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,760
If this is all called injury

723
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,039
Then you really

724
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:33,800
So young

725
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,639
Li Siyu

726
00:38:39,519 --> 00:38:40,920
Don't look down on people

727
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,239
Li Siyu

728
00:38:47,079 --> 00:38:49,039
I must be familiar to you

729
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:50,599
You wait

730
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,400
This day will not be too late

731
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,400
Not too late

732
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,599
How did you come

733
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:23,159
I came over to talk to the publicity department of Lubao

734
00:39:23,159 --> 00:39:24,000
Get in touch

735
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:26,159
They said you are here

736
00:39:26,719 --> 00:39:27,559
I'll come and have a look

737
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:29,920
How is it going well

738
00:39:31,239 --> 00:39:31,920
Okay

739
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,920
But the same as you said

740
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,519
Now emerald

741
00:39:36,519 --> 00:39:38,039
Brand promotion

742
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:38,679
Also used

743
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:39,760
Routines more than ten years ago

744
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:41,199
With the current situation

745
00:39:41,199 --> 00:39:42,039
Already a bit out of touch

746
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:44,440
Yiming

747
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,280
I support you whatever you do

748
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,360
What I want is the final result

749
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,480
But this is not an easy job

750
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,639
Otherwise I won't

751
00:39:53,639 --> 00:39:56,280
I beg you to shoot five times

752
00:39:57,639 --> 00:39:58,679
I will not let you down

753
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:00,360
Thank you

754
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,840
I should thank you

755
00:40:03,719 --> 00:40:05,079
Why are you so polite

756
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:06,800
okay

757
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,119
I have to hurry back to the company

758
00:40:08,119 --> 00:40:08,960
I'll go now

759
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:09,599
Row

760
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,719
what happened

761
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,719
I'll be fine

762
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:21,840
Just want to look at you again

763
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,920
Okay, don't hide

764
00:40:25,719 --> 00:40:26,440
I'm leaving

765
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:27,519
Ok

766
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,159
Brother Yiming

767
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,079
Zhizhi

768
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,119
How did you come

769
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:56,679
I happen to be here to do something

770
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,360
How are you doing now

771
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:05,880
pretty good

772
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,760
That one

773
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:11,519
It's nothing

774
00:41:13,719 --> 00:41:15,079
OK, that's good

775
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:17,320
I'll go now

776
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,239

OK, um, bye

779
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:41,280
Zhizhi

780
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:41,960
Ok

781
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,679
You're thin but energetic

782
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:45,679
is it

783
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,280
Ok

784
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,280
Your complexion

785
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,199
Also much better than before

786
00:41:48,199 --> 00:41:49,360
Watch me watch me watch me

787
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,039
how about it

788
00:41:51,039 --> 00:41:51,599
Am I better than before

789
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:52,480
Looks younger

790
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,360
You will always be

791
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:56,159
The youngest and beautiful

792
00:41:57,079 --> 00:41:58,039
What a pity

793
00:41:58,599 --> 00:41:59,840
Except for my beauty

794
00:42:00,199 --> 00:42:00,800
Nothing

795
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:05,679
I don't drink sweet

796
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:07,199
Hypocritical

797
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:10,519
Siyu sister

798
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,199
I have another appointment

799
00:42:12,199 --> 00:42:13,880
I have to go first in a while

800
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,079
okay

801
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:16,920
Zhizhi

802
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:17,440
Ok

803
00:42:17,559 --> 00:42:18,559
Did you date that

804
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:19,280
Mr. Su

805
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,159
Zhizhi

806
00:42:23,519 --> 00:42:24,519
You have a boyfriend

807
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:26,960
It doesn't count

808
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:28,840
It doesn't count if you have proposed

809
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,360
I promised nothing

810
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:33,039
How are others

811
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:35,480
A good person

812
00:42:37,719 --> 00:42:38,920
that

813
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,559
Do you love him

814
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:44,760
What is love

815
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:48,920
You can ask me down

816
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,639
Chen Yiming and I

817
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:59,079
When we first started together

818
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,440
meeting

819
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,960
Heartbeat

820
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,519
Sweaty palms

821
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,960
I only see customers

822
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,840
So my heartbeat will increase

823
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:11,800
Sweaty palms

824
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,920
Where's Su Lixing and I

825
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,840
Like an old couple

826
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,360
Not annoying to meet

827
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:18,639
Separate

828
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:19,880
Miss

829
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:21,760
very good already

830
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:25,000
He Mu and I are separated from each other

831
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,320
Tired of meeting

832
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,079
Then you have to marry him

833
00:43:29,199 --> 00:43:30,079
of course

834
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:34,360
Although he is rigid and boring

835
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:35,920
But other conditions

836
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:36,960
All excellent

837
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:38,400
You told me

838
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,519
Don't be too picky

839
00:43:39,519 --> 00:43:41,000
I decided to listen to you this time

840
00:43:41,639 --> 00:43:42,559
Xiaoling

841
00:43:43,519 --> 00:43:44,199
you've changed

842
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,719
I just want to understand

843
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:48,239
Although I can't change him

844
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,920
But i can change myself

845
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,719
As long as I don't pursue perfection

846
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,320
He is perfect

847
00:43:54,159 --> 00:43:56,079
This makes sense
