[To Dear Myself]

2
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,825
[Ep9]

3
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,159
Morning

4
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:52,840
Morning 

5
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:58,200
The report you gave the director, you forgot the data in 2017

6
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:01,799
It's ok, I remedied it for you

7
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,480
Be careful next time

8
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:06,280
Thank you

9
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,000
It's ok

10
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,639
Mr. Liu

11
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:17,479
Actually, last time it's not my fault

12
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,319
Wu told me to do that on purpose

13
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,125
I even asked him if it's ok

14
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,240
He said, it's none of my concern

15
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,319
Really?

16
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,625
I still heard he called someone

17
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,875
As long as you make another mistake, 

18
00:02:37,925 --> 00:02:39,925
you won't be the team leader

19
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,120
But you begin to doubt him

20
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,639
So that man seizes the opportunity

21
00:02:46,325 --> 00:02:47,246
Who's that man?

22
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,879
I don't know

23
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:53,080
Mr. Liu

24
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,680
Be careful

25
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,240
Thank you

26
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:12,719
It's ok

27
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,680
I want to invite you to a dinner another day

28
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:19,919
Well, ok

29
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,439
Hello

30
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,400
Yeah, it's me

31
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:40,520
Ok...

32
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,159
Really?

33
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,439
No idea

34
00:03:43,175 --> 00:03:45,080
He didn't tell this to others

35
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,000
Really?

36
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:20,720
Come out, I have something to ask you

37
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:39,839
Mr. Liu

38
00:04:45,425 --> 00:04:48,321
Why Wu didn't avoid you while making a phone call?

39
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,800
I cried in that corner that night out of homesickness

40
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,800
He thought no one in the office

41
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:59,560
Did you tell anyone else about this?

42
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,839
No

43
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:02,160
Why do you tell me?

44
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:04,319
Mr. Liu

45
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,279
You are a good guy

46
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:09,439
I don't want to see you are entrapped

47
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:20,480
Mr. Liu

48
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,160
Please trust me

49
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,680
You are so good to me

50
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,120
I will never lie to you

51
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,759
I believe you

52
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:36,399
What are you going to do?

53
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,279
I am revising the plan

54
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:43,800
The priority is to reverify the data

55
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:46,360
The workload...

56
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:47,720
Yes

57
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:50,360
I can't do it alone

58
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,120
Mr. Liu, I can help you

59
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,000
I can stay up late

60
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,399
Thank you

61
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:04,160
It's so tricky even if you help me

62
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,366
The most important thing is to find out Wu's traps

63
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,959
Xiaotian, your turn

64
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:19,480
Sister Siyu, this week...

65
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:19,959
Sister Siyu

66
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:21,040
Guys

67
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:21,839
Are you all pigs?

68
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:22,360
Look over there

69
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:24,040
Stare at me every day

70
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,120
You are waiting to be fed?

71
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:27,360
You think you have orders while you sit in the office?

72
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,839
Sales depend on legs

73
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:30,240
Go, move

74
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,639
Why are you standing here?

75
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:33,600
I will sack you if you can't meet this month's performance

76
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,160
Sister Yuan is so screwed

77
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:37,399
She is going to break down

78
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,600
Go out...

79
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:42,240
Of course

80
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:44,120
We have surpassed them

81
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:45,879
Don't talk about them

82
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:48,000
Xiaojia, your number

83
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:51,399
2 million this week

84
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,199
2.4 million

85
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,839
Sister Siyu

86
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:57,319
2.5 million

87
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:00,279
Sister, I can't

88
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:01,240
2.6 million

89
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:04,439
Ok

90
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,164
2.6 million, ok

91
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,240
2.6 million, come on

92
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:14,759
Lin Ling, where are you?

93
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,800
Why don't you come for the meeting?

94
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,879
Sister Siyu, help

95
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,480
What happened?

96
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:22,759
I have talked with the representative of Meiyi Group for 3 months

97
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,879
Today we are here to sign the contract

98
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,639
But Liu Jie also came

99
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,560
It's your client, why she went there?

100
00:07:29,575 --> 00:07:31,279
It's a long story

101
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,360
You should come now

102
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,879
I can't handle her alone

103
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,279
Wait for me

104
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,279
Go on without me

105
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,240
Li Siyu didn't teach you about company rules and regulations?

106
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:11,839
Sister Yuan

107
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,120
What rules and regulations?

108
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,720
Meiyi Group is Liu Jie's client

109
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,560
It has nothing to do with you

110
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,079
But she has given up

111
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,120
I never said so

112
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,639
Ok

113
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:20,360
You said it yourself

114
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,600
Stop talking, go back

115
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:22,600
No

116
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,439
I have talked with the client for three months

117
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:25,720
Why should I give it to her now?

118
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,639
Not give, you should step out of this

119
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:28,800
Why?

120
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,440
Here you are

121
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:33,519
Sister Yuan

122
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,399
We should be reasonable, right?

123
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,639
Lin Ling picks up the client Liu Jie gives up on

124
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:39,919
She's worked on it for three months 

125
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,720
She is going to sign the contract

126
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,120
Liu Jie suddenly wants to take it back

127
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,720
No one will accept this right?

128
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,519
Who said, Liu Jie gave up?

129
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,320
She just put it aside for a while

130
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,000
Sometimes we need cold treatment for the client

131
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,480
I have taught you this before, right?

132
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:55,360
Thank you

133
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,200
I remember you even taught me

134
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,330
to seize the opportunity firmly

135
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:01,159
So I taught Lin Ling about this 

136
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:02,960
Stop it

137
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:05,240
The company has its rules and regulations

138
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:07,120
Rules and regulations must be reasonable

139
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:12,440
Director Luo

140
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:13,519
Director Luo

141
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:14,320
Sorry

142
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,080
Director Luo,  -Sorry

143
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,399
We made it at 15:00

144
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,960
I just had a meal with the mayor

145
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,960
So I am a bit late

146
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:19,639
It's ok

147
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:20,240
Sorry...

148
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,279
Director Luo, do you remember me?

149
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,399
You are from Lubao Group too, right?

150
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:27,960
Correct

151
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:29,200
Director Luo

152
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,200
I am the sales manager of Lubao Company

153
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:31,840
Li Siyu

154
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:32,840
Ok

155
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:34,759
Director Luo

156
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:38,000
I am Lubao's sales director Yuan Huizhong

157
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,240
So many people here today

158
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,519
Yes

159
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:47,200
It shows our respect and sincerity

160
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:50,960
So who should I talk to?

161
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:51,720
Talk to me

162
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,480
Director Luo, I have been on this all along

163
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,799
Only I know the details

164
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:57,440
Talk to me, you will save time

165
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:02,200
So you are not the same team

166
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,600
Of course we are

167
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:05,720
But if you talk to me

168
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,799
I can give you more convenience

169
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:08,960
Director Luo

170
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,879
Director Yuan is our superior

171
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:13,039
We all listen to her

172
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:26,240
Ok

173
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,519
Tian Siyu

174
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:29,720
Yuan Huizhong

175
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,679
Yuan Huizhong

176
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:32,279
Ok

177
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,550
Please... Come to my office

178
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:38,879
Come

179
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:02,720
Why not foil her lie?

180
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,100
It's not good for Lubao's reputation 

181
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,600
if we argue in front of the client

182
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:09,559
What should we do now?

183
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:11,120
The order is 5 million 

184
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:14,960
What's going on with this client?

185
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,840
During my internship, sister Yuan led me

186
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,252
A friend introduced director Luo to me

187
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:20,759
But at that time sister Yuan said

188
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:21,720
I was inexperienced

189
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,080
She told Liu Jie to lead me

190
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,000
Liu Jie took me to talk with director Luo several times

191
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,879
But he was not sincere

192
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:27,759
So we gave up

193
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,960
Then I go to your team

194
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,440
Director Luo contacted me again

195
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:34,639
This time everything goes smoothly

196
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:38,735
When we were about to sign the contract, Liu Jie came

197
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,325
So it's your name in the file or her name?

198
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,399
I don't know

199
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:46,879
I just came to the company at that time

200
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:47,840
I didn't know all this

201
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:50,759
So did she cancel the name in the file

202
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:52,039
when she gave up on the order?

203
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:52,960
It's...

204
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:56,159
No idea

205
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,759
Go back first

206
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:08,159
Excuse me

207
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:09,279
Where is the cold medicine?

208
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,480
Cough medicine is also here?

209
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:17,919
Boy, you have a cold?

210
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:20,440
Come, let me take your pulse

211
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:22,919
No, thanks

212
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:23,799
I just need some medicine

213
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:25,480
How about this?

214
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,250
It's your decision to make 

215
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,279
whether you believe me or not what I say

216
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:32,519
Anyway, it will cost you nothing

217
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:34,279
Come

218
00:12:54,825 --> 00:13:00,200
You have the cold because of the low temperature

219
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,080
Maybe I was caught in the rain days ago

220
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,025
You have a strong physique

221
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:11,050
I don't think you have the serious cold because of the rain

222
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,750
Having a cold is the superficial symptom

223
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,519
The left wrist is not smooth

224
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:21,639
Right hand pulse is tight and rigid

225
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,559
And you have some discomfort in your internal organs

226
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:26,679
You have some anxiety

227
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:31,320
What medicine should I take?

228
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:32,960
We have a lot of cold medicines

229
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,600
As for the discomfort and anxiety

230
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:42,300
If you can't let it go now, no medicine could work

231
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:45,720
What should I let go?

232
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:50,360
Let all your concerns go

233
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:54,960
According to Chinese medicine,

234
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,475
all diseases originate from the mental disease

235
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,639
Nowadays, all young people's diseases are because

236
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:06,360
they can't get what they want and they are afraid to lose

237
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,700
So let go,

238
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,960
you mean we don't need to work hard

239
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:19,375
Just let it go if we can't get it or we are afraid to lose it

240
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:25,799
I mean, everything needs to be based on the actual situation

241
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:29,200
Ginseng and antler are good

242
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,799
Many people feel refreshed after eating them

243
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:37,320
But it's also harmful for some people

244
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,759
Let me give you some prescription 

245
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:44,799
Thank you, doctor

246
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:45,440
No need...

247
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:50,480
I'll try to let it go

248
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:51,879
Don't worry

249
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,639
I will pay you the consultation fee

250
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,919
Thank you...

251
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,759
Liu Jie didn't cancel

252
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:14,080
No

253
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,120
So what's all this?

254
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:22,879
Hello

255
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,000
Li Siyu

256
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,875
President Pan wants to see you and Lin Ling in his office

257
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:29,799
Ok, I get it

258
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:32,840
Go to president Pan's office

259
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,960
President Pan, vice president Fang

260
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,600
Li Siyu

261
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,000
What's going on today?

262
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,879
Meiyi Group?

263
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,440
What else could it be?

264
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:01,840
It's Lin Ling's client

265
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:03,120
I have checked it

266
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:05,360
Liu Jie is registered in the file

267
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:08,559
President Pan, vice president Fang

268
00:16:09,025 --> 00:16:11,480
We need to report and file the client's name in advance

269
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,759
We are not allowed to grab clients

270
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:14,200
We can't lower the price for vicious competition

271
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,550
But Li Siyu and Lin Ling just ignore company's rules and regulations

272
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:20,399
I think it's a serious problem

273
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,279
The vice can't be tolerated in our company

274
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:24,840
Sister Yuan, you really want to be like this?

275
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,960
What's wrong?

276
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,960
The company's interests are above all else

277
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,525
I mean you can't call white black or confuse right and wrong

278
00:16:31,525 --> 00:16:33,086
because of this order, right?

279
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,559
You are even here to denounce me here first

280
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:35,759
Li Siyu

281
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,480
Who call white black?

282
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,080
It's the company's regulations

283
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,960
Those who file the client's name have the order

284
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,600
No internal vicious competition

285
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:45,120
You encourage your subordinates to play hard for KPI

286
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,240
Who are you talking about?

287
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:47,159
It's you

288
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,000
Enough

289
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:52,919
Here is not vegetable market

290
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:54,519
It's work

291
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:56,360
Tell the truth, get to the point

292
00:16:58,425 --> 00:17:00,320
Lin Ling is the first one to contact Meiyi Group

293
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:02,875
And she is also the one who gets the contract

294
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:05,759
Lin Ling has kept all the evidence of the negotiation

295
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,319
President Pan

296
00:17:11,675 --> 00:17:13,680
I am the first to contact Meiyi Group

297
00:17:14,675 --> 00:17:17,559
Director Luo is my friend for many years

298
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:18,440
Come on

299
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,920
He doesn't know you at all

300
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,200
He saw you for the first time today

301
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:22,359
I know it

302
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,880
I also know director Luo

303
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,000
At the beginning, Huizhong introduced him

304
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,079
It's been at least ten years

305
00:17:28,358 --> 00:17:29,119
I see

306
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,279
President Pan

307
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:33,680
Director Luo and I have made the contract long ago

308
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:36,950
His company had some problems 

309
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:39,125
So we didn't sign the contract till now

310
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,900
But I didn't expect Lin Ling would step in

311
00:17:42,675 --> 00:17:44,480
And she even offered a lower price

312
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:47,875
Fortunately, director Luo sees me as his friend

313
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,225
So he accepts my price and finally we sign the contract

314
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:52,920
You sign the contract?

315
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:54,240
Yes

316
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:55,440
5 million

317
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:56,920
He will pay the deposit tomorrow

318
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:00,359
What is your offer?

319
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:04,900
My offer is higher than Lin ling's

320
00:18:06,925 --> 00:18:09,039
You even said you were the sales director

321
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,160
Lin Ling, let me tell you

322
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:14,039
When I was a little manager

323
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:17,455
for the convenience, I even said I was vice president

324
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:19,200
President Pan also did this

325
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,225
To avoid being despised,

326
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:22,680
he said he was the director of an association

327
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,039
It's very normal

328
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:26,119
President Pan

329
00:18:26,475 --> 00:18:28,279
I think it's a serious problem

330
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:30,480
If everyone grabs clients viciously,

331
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,680
it will ruin our company's reputation and we can't work

332
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,759
Meiyi Group is my client

333
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:37,200
The fact is here

334
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,480
You're still talking nonsense here

335
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,440
I'm not

336
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,519
I won't talk nonsense with you

337
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:42,880
I have nothing to say

338
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,920
I just hope president Pan, you could uphold justice for me

339
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,000
You're lying

340
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:47,039
Shut up

341
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,900
Meiyi Group is team A's client

342
00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:09,200
The order of 5 million goes to team A

343
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,025
And Lin Ling will be fined 5,000 yuan

344
00:19:14,025 --> 00:19:15,775
because of the violation of company's rules and regulations

345
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,550
Li Siyu, as a superior,

346
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:21,875
will be fined 10,000 yuan for the negligence

347
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,440
And you will be criticized in a circulated notice

348
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,640
Sister Siyu

349
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,359
Sister Siyu

350
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:38,920
Sister Siyu

351
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,440
You know, it's Liu Jie's filed client

352
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,720
Why did you do this?

353
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,880
I don't know

354
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,200
You should know

355
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:45,240
Now you lost your client

356
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:45,799
The contract is gone

357
00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:46,839
And they even make a countercharge

358
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:47,880
Are we happy now?

359
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:49,680
I am sorry, sister Siyu

360
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:35,960
Siyu

361
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,000
Come early after you get off work

362
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:39,839
Anything wrong?

363
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,720
I am preparing the dinner

364
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,200
You find a new job?

365
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,359
No

366
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,960
Why are you so happy?

367
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:49,720
So I can't be happy?

368
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,400
Today I met a senior herbalist doctorr

369
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:55,480
Senior herbalist doctor?

370
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,400
What happened to you?

371
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,279
I was caught in the rain days ago

372
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:00,119
So I have a cold

373
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:01,400
I went to get some medicine

374
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,440
And I met him

375
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:03,799
Oh

376
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,039
Do you want to know what's gone on?

377
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,119
All ears

378
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,039
The senior herbalist doctor said

379
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,079
I am depressed

380
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:17,960
Because I think too much

381
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:19,200
I should learn to let it go

382
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,279
Are you there?

383
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,000
I am listening

384
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:31,119
So, I plan to let it go

385
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:35,200
I'll entertain myself

386
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:39,240
At least I have a good health even if I have no job

387
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:50,400
What's wrong, Siyu?

388
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:53,400
Are you ok?

389
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:56,400
Nothing, lost an order

390
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,279
Siyu

391
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:01,839
The sales performance is so important for you?

392
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:07,650
It decides whether I can be the director next month

393
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,750
So what?

394
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:15,319
I have to fight for it

395
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:20,759
Maybe this is the so-called worry

396
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,200
We want to get it and we are afraid to lose

397
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:26,640
What are you talking about?

398
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:28,559
The senior herbalist doctor told me this

399
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:32,279
We want to get it and we are afraid to lose

400
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:34,960
What did you say?

401
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:37,279
After I lost my job

402
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:39,119
I have been applying for a job

403
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,125
All the interviews and resumes

404
00:22:42,125 --> 00:22:44,200
And I failed over and over again

405
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:46,319
It's just temporary

406
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:50,200
My friends told me now is the off season for job hunting

407
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:52,839
So you can't doubt yourself

408
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:56,350
I believe soon you will have good news

409
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:00,400
Siyu

410
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,799
I want to stop looking for a job for a while

411
00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:10,759
Yiming

412
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:13,720
Do you think too much?

413
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:18,425
I think I used to run so fast 

414
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,119
and think too little

415
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,599
Yeah, we can't think too little

416
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,640
But we have to run fast

417
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:29,150
Even if we can't get it in the end, at least we try our best

418
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,200
We can start over, no big deal

419
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:36,900
If we are so hesitant, we will get nothing

420
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:38,640
You never failed

421
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:40,400
Siyu

422
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:43,825
It is not so easy to start over

423
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,955
I have just said, I lost an order

424
00:23:54,039 --> 00:23:55,039
Will you come tonight?

425
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,799
I will be there late

426
00:23:58,359 --> 00:23:59,200
Overwork?

427
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:02,000
I have to go out

428
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,599
Where?

429
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,519
See the client

430
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,920
I need to get the order of 5 million back

431
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,200
Your words are harsh

432
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:03,160
Still, I want to thank you

433
00:25:33,075 --> 00:25:35,759
Yuwei's mom, you can't dress so casually till then

434
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:37,039
I...

435
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:40,880
Yeah, you need to wear formal clothes

436
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,799
And your shoes and your bag 

437
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:43,720
You need to change them

438
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,039
Otherwise it's so unsightly

439
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:28,839
Everybody

440
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:30,359
Wednesday evening at 19:30

441
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:31,400
Gather at the dessert shop

442
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:33,620
Discuss about the joint letter

443
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,800
Hope all the parents will come 

444
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:39,920
Sorry

445
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,160
I have no time tomorrow night

446
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,000
Ok

447
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,039
You are back

448
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,599
They are sleeping?

449
00:27:34,025 --> 00:27:36,119
Why are you back so late every day?

450
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,559
I will come back later than this in the future

451
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:39,960
Why?

452
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:45,200
Wu wants to be the team leader

453
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,920
He wants to nitpick me

454
00:27:47,225 --> 00:27:51,000
So I need to do everything

455
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,839
He is so evil?

456
00:27:54,759 --> 00:27:57,200
It's common to see people like this in the workplace

457
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,799
Yeah

458
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,125
After sister Siyu begins to compete for the director

459
00:28:02,125 --> 00:28:04,100
she has the endless troubles

460
00:28:04,625 --> 00:28:06,920
President Pan called her to his office this morning

461
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,200
She is fined

462
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,400
Now you know it's hard to work in the company, right?

463
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:13,500
So in the future, you don't go out with them

464
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:14,880
Take care of the family

465
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,880
So I won't be distracted

466
00:28:16,375 --> 00:28:19,240
I do this all for Yuwei

467
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:24,325
Nowadays, the society values the resources and connections

468
00:28:25,425 --> 00:28:29,750
I maintain the relationship with them for Yuwei

469
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:33,119
So she will have a better platform in the future

470
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:37,480
But is it too early to think about this?

471
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:40,119
Not early at all

472
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:42,880
We have the differnt starting points

473
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,759
We need to make an effort in advance in locker room

474
00:28:46,675 --> 00:28:49,640
So people from countryside like me will have 

475
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:52,100
no qualification to enter the locker room

476
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,640
But I am still so great

477
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:55,920
It's the past

478
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,849
The poor students like you still have the opportunity

479
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,519
It's different now

480
00:29:00,875 --> 00:29:04,279
I need Yuwei to go to the elite circles since childhood

481
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:07,100
When she grows up, she will become an elite

482
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:10,319
Well, there is a parents gathering tomorrow

483
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:12,279
They will write a joint letter to kindergarten

484
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:14,519
So parents need to be there together

485
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:18,680
I have just said

486
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:21,707
The office fight is very tense

487
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:24,000
I need to work overtime

488
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:26,480
I have no time for your gathering

489
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:30,599
No

490
00:29:31,025 --> 00:29:34,119
It's about Yuwei's future

491
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:36,839
Zhizhi

492
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,599
Neither of us are elites

493
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,799
You try so hard to get into that circle

494
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:43,119
Don't you feel tired?

495
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,240
Yes, I am

496
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,200
Let nature take its course

497
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,525
Just live a simple life, ok?

498
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:53,759
Are you hungry?

499
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,079
I will cook you a bowl of wontons

500
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,440
No need

501
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,759
It's ok soon

502
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:40,359
Have lunch together

503
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,960
I won't go if you want to eat with Li Siyu

504
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,960
Only two of us

505
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,200
Ok

506
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,000
Zhizhi

507
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:23,519
Sister Siyu, you're not in the company?

508
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:27,925
I am on the way to company now

509
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:29,480
How's it?

510
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:32,000
500,000

511
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,079
It's a small order

512
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,799
Sister Siyu

513
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,599
I find a good restaurant

514
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:39,759
Have lunch together

515
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:41,119
You should change your mood

516
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,160
Come

517
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,279
It's my treat

518
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,680
Ok

519
00:31:57,799 --> 00:31:59,799
Gu Xiaoling won't come, right?

520
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,400
You want to invite her?

521
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:05,000
No, only two of us

522
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,880
Ok, I'll book the table now

523
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,079
Ok

524
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,400
Miss Zhang reserved the table

525
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,279
This way please

526
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:45,160
You two arrived before me

527
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:47,000
I have something to do, I have to go now

528
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,319
Eat first

529
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,400
I have to go now

530
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,400
Xiaoling

531
00:32:54,119 --> 00:32:55,240
Sit...

532
00:32:55,319 --> 00:32:56,200
Sit down first

533
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,775
Zhizhi, you don't know I break up with her?

534
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:05,279
I know

535
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:08,920
But you often break up every year

536
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:11,920
And it won't last more than a week

537
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:16,039
So it's almost a week

538
00:33:16,475 --> 00:33:18,000
So I invite you two here

539
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,559
We won't make up this time

540
00:33:23,799 --> 00:33:26,825
You said the same last time

541
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:33,760
You said the same last year

542
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:38,625
And you said the same two years ago

543
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:45,960
Two sisters

544
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,759
Both of you are over 30

545
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:52,609
Why are you so grumpy like kids?

546
00:33:53,425 --> 00:33:55,640
Yuwei are not so grumpy now

547
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,680
She blacklisted me

548
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,400
Yes

549
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:02,825
But before that, she transferred you 110,000

550
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,599
Sister Siyu

551
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,325
Last time you were framed up and had a bad mood

552
00:34:13,699 --> 00:34:15,198
No one could contact you

553
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,719
You don't know how anxious she was

554
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:27,559
Excuse me

555
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:28,960
I have to make it clear

556
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:33,950
If either of you leave, I will be angry

557
00:34:56,625 --> 00:35:01,125
Thank you anyway

558
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,625
I have helped you a lot these years

559
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,880
But you never appreciate it

560
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,480
I also helped you a lot

561
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,119
Your dad found you write love letter to a boy 

562
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:13,079
before the college entrance examination

563
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:15,079
I stood up for you

564
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:18,119
You couldn't even pass the graduation exam without me

565
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:19,440
You had no money when you first came to Shanghai 

566
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,480
I saved my money and sent the money to you

567
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,880
You had no place to live in Shanghai

568
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,519
I shared the bed with you

569
00:35:24,519 --> 00:35:27,175
I helped you every time you quarreled with Chen Yiming

570
00:35:27,519 --> 00:35:28,960
Why are you arguing again?

571
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,599
Zhizhi

572
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:32,065
Tell us, I helped her more or she helped me more?

573
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:33,760
You have noted all down

574
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,125
Come, get out your notebook now

575
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:36,960
It will tell all

576
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:41,875
You have been sisters since childhood

577
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,679
You should help each other

578
00:35:49,575 --> 00:35:54,400
You should feel grateful to have each other

579
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:02,875
In my heart, you have different styles

580
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,719
But you are my good sisters

581
00:36:07,175 --> 00:36:09,650
Now you become like this

582
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:11,650
I want to take back my worship of you two

583
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:17,440
I admit

584
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:23,075
These years she helped me more

585
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:30,152
We have been sisters for so many years

586
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,159
I know

587
00:36:35,325 --> 00:36:39,440
I know you have disputes sometimes

588
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:43,599
But you wish each other good?

589
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:48,150
No one can hurt your relationship

590
00:36:56,425 --> 00:36:59,239
I am sorry for the bad attitude that day

591
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,480
It's ok

592
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,280
I want to thank you

593
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:14,639
Need the loo

594
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,519
Between these two,

595
00:37:25,559 --> 00:37:26,679
add two or three light spots

596
00:37:27,559 --> 00:37:28,199
Ok

597
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:33,199
Are you tired?

598
00:37:33,425 --> 00:37:35,400
Let's take a break there

599
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:36,599
Ok, let's go

600
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,119
Sit

601
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:40,920
Ok

602
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:49,679
Come

603
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,880
Thank you

604
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:55,320
I know it's hard for you

605
00:37:56,159 --> 00:37:57,960
It's ok

606
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,760
Let me see

607
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:04,079
How many steps have we taken?

608
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:08,199
20,000 steps

609
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,639
A piece of cake

610
00:38:11,425 --> 00:38:14,480
I used to walk 20 kilometers back and forth to school

611
00:38:15,239 --> 00:38:16,320
Mountain roads

612
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,400
You are from the countryside

613
00:38:19,159 --> 00:38:19,920
Yes

614
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:23,800
Me, too

615
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,360
Mr. Liu

616
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:29,719
Actually we are alumni

617
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:30,920
Really?

618
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,960
It's not easy to be admitted to Chiao Tung University

619
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,239
I am the top pick in our county

620
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,360
Me, too

621
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,199
I know

622
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,000
It's not easy for us

623
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,239
Mr. Liu

624
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:59,199
Can I call you brother?

625
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:00,559
Of course

626
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,239
Brother

627
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,840
Are you used to urban life?

628
00:39:11,925 --> 00:39:14,440
Not entirely

629
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,079
For example

630
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:18,639
Let alone others

631
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,960
Food, for example

632
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:22,199
I like the hometown's food

633
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:23,199
Exactly

634
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:24,360
I feel the same

635
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:27,119
In childhood, if I was hungry

636
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,400
I would dig some potatoes in the field

637
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,280
Then threw them in the wood stove

638
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,920
It would be cooked soon

639
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:33,760
Then I would get them out

640
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:36,239
Peel them and dip in soy sauce

641
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:37,360
Or chili powder

642
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,440
You know this too?

643
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:40,719
Of course

644
00:39:41,375 --> 00:39:45,280
It's so fragrant

645
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,320
What a pity

646
00:39:51,159 --> 00:39:54,800
Now even imported potatoes can't be that delicious

647
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,700
Well, Yayun

648
00:40:07,725 --> 00:40:10,980
I have a good idea

649
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,880
But I need your cooperation

650
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:16,239
Ok, I will help you

651
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:29,599
Zhizhi

652
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:31,039
Do you have diarrhea?

653
00:40:31,525 --> 00:40:33,079
You went to the toilet so frequently

654
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:37,760
Liu Yang's mom is here

655
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,239
She is here

656
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:43,079
Help you take care of Yuwei

657
00:40:47,175 --> 00:40:50,505
She asked us to have a son

658
00:40:51,925 --> 00:40:57,519
I need to drink two bowls of Chinese medicine for pregnancy

659
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,760
Now I have diarrhea

660
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:02,880
The time's changed

661
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,280
She still forces you to have a son?

662
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:06,000
So ridiculous

663
00:41:06,275 --> 00:41:10,300
All her neighbors have sons

664
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:13,880
So she wants one

665
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:15,360
No way

666
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:18,880
So outrageous

667
00:41:19,125 --> 00:41:22,614
It's so unbelievable

668
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:28,119
Yes, it's ridiculous

669
00:41:30,519 --> 00:41:31,159
Shit

670
00:41:31,719 --> 00:41:33,079
It's over 3,000 yuan

671
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:34,880
Here

672
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,199
Over 3,000?

673
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,159
Yes

674
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,079
It's hard to tell

675
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,639
You are a battery seller

676
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,252
It's weird if you know the price of clothes

677
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,039
Xiaoling

678
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,360
Can you do me a favor?

679
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,119
Say it

680
00:41:53,159 --> 00:41:55,532
Yuwei's class will hold a party

681
00:41:57,775 --> 00:42:00,960
All moms will be well dressed

682
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:05,679
You also know I only wear these clothes

683
00:42:05,679 --> 00:42:06,840
No need to say more

684
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:08,360
Come to my house this weekend

685
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,480
Clothes, bags, shoes

686
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,199
You can choose whatever you want

687
00:42:11,079 --> 00:42:11,840
Thank you

688
00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:17,079
To you

689
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:21,400
So good to have you

690
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,000
Thank you

691
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,559
Now we make up with each other

692
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:25,840
Thank you

693
00:42:32,599 --> 00:42:37,639
Sister Siyu, can you have dinner tonight with us

694
00:42:37,975 --> 00:42:40,039
Help me talk to Liu Yang's mom

695
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,400
No problem

696
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:43,440
I know you are busy

697
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:45,360
I don't want to ask you the favor

698
00:42:46,679 --> 00:42:49,664
But I really can't change his mom's mind

699
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:51,880
It's ok

700
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:53,679
I haven't been to your home for a long time

701
00:42:56,599 --> 00:42:57,840
Sort out this

702
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,239
Thank you

703
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,719
Sister Yuan, I will go now

704
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:01,639
Ok

705
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,199
How's it?

706
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:07,199
Don't worry, sister Yuan

707
00:43:07,559 --> 00:43:08,840
You lead her now

708
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:10,519
How much?

709
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,519
1.13 million

710
00:43:14,039 --> 00:43:15,079
Only 1.13 million?

711
00:43:15,079 --> 00:43:16,760
I just got an order of 5 million 

712
00:43:17,239 --> 00:43:17,840
Correct

713
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:18,960
Plus the order of 5 million

714
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:21,199
You lead her by 1.13 million
