00:01:25,499 --> 00:01:33,599
# Google translate version for your reference #

2
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,199
Yuwei is asleep

3
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:22,680
I still don't believe

4
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,120
You are really

5
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,439
Broke up with Yiming

6
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,520
Yes indeed

7
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,319
Why are you suddenly

8
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,800
That's what happened

9
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,479
Life

10
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,680
Siyu sister

11
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,319
Are you too strong

12
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,199
Yes indeed

13
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:50,879
If you can't, just take a step back

14
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:53,000
Get married before starting a business

15
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,240
No big deal

16
00:02:58,039 --> 00:03:00,000
This is not a matter of order

17
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:05,000
Is what he and I want most

18
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:07,240
Different

19
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,919
Can't it reconcile?

20
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,439
Reconciled to today

21
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,319
I'm tired

22
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:21,680
Is it possible for you to get back together?

23
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:27,439
impossible

24
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:35,000
Cry if you want

25
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,960
Cry happily

26
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:48,599
I don't have time to cry

27
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,199
There is so much work waiting for me

28
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,800
fortunately

29
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:59,159
I still have a job

30
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,479
If you really want to divide

31
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,080
You two have settled the bill

32
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:08,919
What account

33
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,400
The house they bought together

34
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,039
How to do

35
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,319
How to repay the loan

36
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,720
You go find him

37
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:18,800
I do not have time

38
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,000
This idea is good

39
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,199
You two can still

40
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:57,240
Take care of each other

41
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,360
You can live in my house to save money

42
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,399
But I want to tell you clearly

43
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:06,639
If i have an important date

44
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,000
You are going out to stay in a hotel

45
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,279
and also

46
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,120
You can't be like when you were a kid

47
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,360
What is forcing me every day

48
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,639
Memorizing words and writing

49
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:15,600
Homework

50
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:16,639
and also

51
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,439
Can't dress me up

52
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,879
Just call me a fairy

53
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:21,480
Not to give a small report to parents

54
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:23,319
I won't

55
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:30,680
Zhizhi

56
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:32,800
What did you plan

57
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:44,519
from

58
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,720
I heard

59
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:50,720
Liu Yang has an accident

60
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,399
That woman bit Liu Yang back

61
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:54,480
Liu Yang and her

62
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,759
This time it was really broken

63
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,399
So what?

64
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:05,879
some things

65
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,879
Once found

66
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:10,959
It is impossible to pretend

67
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:12,160
do not know anything

68
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:15,120
What's the matter

69
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:17,279
Liu Yang is a very dull

70
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,120
Very bored man

71
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:23,160
Not romantic

72
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:26,160
Will not take care of people

73
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,879
But when i see

74
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:29,680
He and Wei Yayun

75
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,519
When together

76
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:31,839
I just found

77
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,879
He will be romantic

78
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:42,519
Also take care of people

79
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:47,639
Just look to whom

80
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,639
The five years of marriage

81
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:02,959
Life is very hard

82
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:06,439
But I am willing

83
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,040
Thought he loves me

84
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:12,360
I love him too

85
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:17,639
I am willing to give everything for him

86
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,639
in fact

87
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,319
I'm deceiving myself and others

88
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,519
He doesn't love me at all

89
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,639
He didn't treat me as a lover

90
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,920
As a wife

91
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,240
All the time

92
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,720
He only treats me as a nanny

93
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:45,959
But you till now

94
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:49,399
I still go to the hospital every day to take care of him

95
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:57,079
Although I have treated him

96
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:58,319
Completely disappointed

97
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,079
But he is after all

98
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,720
Yuwei's father

99
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:08,240
Zhizhi, you are too kind

100
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,759
Zhizhi, you are too kind

101
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:14,639
In marriage

102
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,720
Kindness

103
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,079
Can't exchange for sincere

104
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:22,279
Even if I get my heart

105
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,639
Will be pressured by life

106
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:27,399
Riddled with holes

107
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,279
okay

108
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,480
Stop talking about you two

109
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:37,480
Keep on saying that

110
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,519
We all become bitter women

111
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,639
You are

112
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,000
For a scum

113
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,399
I wasted five years of youth

114
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,000
It doesn't matter

115
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,200
The next five years

116
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,320
We happily live

117
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:48,919
Lose now

118
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:50,200
Win it all back

119
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,879
And you

120
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,720
Isn't it just a broken love?

121
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:54,960
I have less than half a year

122
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,480
I've been broken up twice

123
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:58,159
Do you see me complaining

124
00:08:58,639 --> 00:08:59,559
Decadent?

125
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,240
Repeated defeats

126
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,960
To get the final victory

127
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:04,559
Pour all the wine

128
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:11,279
Upside down

129
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,960
Ok and mine

130
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,120
I declare

131
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,039
We have to take all the complaints

132
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,919
Worries

133
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:28,759
All stay today

134
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:31,120
Tomorrow is a new day

135
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,240
Cheers

136
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,200
Cheers

137
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:39,519
Is she okay

138
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,639
well

139
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:46,120
About her business

140
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:46,960
What's going on

141
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:48,600
You don't support her either

142
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:49,639
Don't ask

143
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,039
She hopes

144
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:58,159
You sold that house

145
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:00,200
Repay her down payment

146
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,639
That house is sold

147
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:05,679
Can't buy it back

148
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,840
Or don't sell it

149
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:10,440
But she is really short of money now

150
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:14,440
I think of a way

151
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:19,039
I asked the agent

152
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:20,320
The house has gone up now

153
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,519
If sold

154
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:22,519
You have to pay her at least 800,000

155
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,840
Xiaoling

156
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:31,720
The house has been

157
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,120
It went up by 300,000

158
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,080
I know

159
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:35,279
and

160
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:37,279
And Siyu was altogether

161
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:38,960
Out of half a million

162
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:40,799
She was with you for five years

163
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:42,279
Shouldn't you

164
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:43,240
Compensate her

165
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:50,000
But but i now

166
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,039
Can't get so much money

167
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:53,960
Then you write the IOU

168
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,480
And me

169
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,639
I asked for 300 thousand more for you

170
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,720
Who asked you to do this

171
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,960
I'm helping you fight for your rights

172
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,200
Are you fighting for rights?

173
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,480
You are blackmail

174
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,679
Why am I blackmailed?

175
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,759
On the real estate certificate

176
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:14,799
Write clearly

177
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:16,240
Half of you

178
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:17,559
I want 800,000

179
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:18,799
Not too much

180
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:19,759
Say again

181
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:21,159
Youth compensation

182
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:22,440
We gotta point

183
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:24,720
I knew you were this way

184
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,639
I shouldn't let you go

185
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,759
your business

186
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:30,000
I will never care about you again

187
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:19,960
tomorrow we

188
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,559
To change the title certificate of the house

189
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:04,519
I can't take out 800,000

190
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,200
Let's talk after the formalities

191
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:22,879
it is good

192
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:32,240
You said I obviously helped her

193
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:33,840
She actually taught me a lesson

194
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:34,759
have you seen

195
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:35,840
Such an ungrateful person?

196
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:38,039
Have seen it

197
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,000
Last time at the gate of the art gallery

198
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,399
I help a woman

199
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,960
Escaped the clutches of the scumbag

200
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,600
The woman scolded me too

201
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,080
Who are you talking about

202
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,480
I said your sisters have a virtue

203
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,559
Don't say who

204
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,559
Having said that

205
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,000
Chen Yiming is my brother

206
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:03,000
You for nothing

207
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Ruined 300,000 people

208
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,840
A bit cruel

209
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:06,840
Why am I for nothing?

210
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,799
He hurt Li Siyu

211
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,840
I help Li Siyu be fair

212
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,639
what happened

213
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,919
Isn't Chen Yiming injured?

214
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:14,720
I saw him yesterday

215
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:17,879
The whole person is too thin

216
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,720
Deserve it

217
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,679
You want me to say

218
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:25,080
This thing is really not to blame

219
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:27,000
Li Siyu is to blame

220
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:28,960
Li Siyu is a bit

221
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,639
Crazy

222
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:30,720
Who is crazy

223
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:32,080
You scolded someone just now

224
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,080
Ungrateful

225
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:34,120
I scold her

226
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,000
You can't scold her

227
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,080
All the time

228
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:47,960
You said they both

229
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,919
Can I get back together?

230
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:52,519
Li Siyu

231
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:54,639
It has to be changed a bit

232
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,120
Otherwise like last time

233
00:15:57,679 --> 00:15:58,600
Score after compounding

234
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,240
Then do you think Chen Yiming

235
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,159
No need to change

236
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,200
Yes

237
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,639
Compare with me

238
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:09,399
Chen Yiming is indeed

239
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:10,559
Not enough sunshine

240
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:11,919
Not handsome enough, not interesting enough

241
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:13,720
But in general

242
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:15,120
Still quite perfect

243
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,080
Come, come, eat skewers, eat skewers

244
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,320
I can't eat spicy food for a month

245
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:24,399
why

246
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:25,879
I got an injection

247
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:26,919
The doctor said to avoid food

248
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:28,960
No way

249
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,919
You have grown up like this

250
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:30,879
Still use injections

251
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:33,440
Although I look so beautiful

252
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,799
But i will get old

253
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,279
What are you afraid of

254
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,919
Isn't there a good song?

255
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,279
How many people can

256
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,799
I love your face when you were young

257
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:49,600
Can anyone

258
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,120
Care about the ruthless changes of the years

259
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:55,360
How many people can

260
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,759
Came and paid in your life

261
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,200
I know I have you in my life

262
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,559
I'm by your side

263
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:06,000
Moved not

264
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,640
why

265
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,440
If i get old

266
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,200
Or only you by my side

267
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:15,279
Then I failed too much

268
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,160
Who will stay by your side will not fail

269
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:20,358
No matter what

270
00:17:20,358 --> 00:17:23,038
Man with silver hair and personable

271
00:17:23,118 --> 00:17:24,719
Retired billionaire

272
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,559
It's not said

273
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:26,759
Me fifty years from now

274
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:27,920
you

275
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,519
Why are you laughing? Look down on people

276
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:33,880
Then you should do it

277
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,640
Something I can afford

278
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,559
That `s a deal

279
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,000
Now house

280
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,319
You alone

281
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,559
I'll collect half a million for you first

282
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:08,400
The remaining 300,000

283
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:10,640
Within two years

284
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:11,799
I must pay it all off

285
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:16,160
This is an IOU

286
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,920
You owe me nothing

287
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:41,079
Siyu

288
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,960
I was once to our future

289
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,480
I have

290
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,079
Many ideas

291
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:08,680
but

292
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:12,559
I never thought

293
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,480
The result will be like this

294
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,680
it is my fault

295
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,920
I can't give you what you want

296
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:26,359
No you are not wrong

297
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:27,559
There is nothing wrong with what you want

298
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,440
only me

299
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:33,119
just

300
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,440
We might

301
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,759
Each has its own direction

302
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,640
No matter what

303
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,960
I really love you

304
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:49,519
I really love you too

305
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,160
We finally have a home

306
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:06,000
Before now after

307
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,519
I'm in your palm

308
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,720
You can always hold me

309
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:34,839
Hey

310
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,880
Hey Yiming

311
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,400
mom

312
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,559
Can you lend me some more money

313
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:47,559
The data on the 18th

314
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:48,559
I watched

315
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,000
All conditions are pretty good

316
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,960
But i think

317
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:54,319
A little older

318
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,319
I hope so

319
00:24:56,319 --> 00:24:57,160
Best age

320
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,359
No more than forty years old

321
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,880
OK, I'll wait for your news

322
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:03,200
Ok

323
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:09,480
Who are you calling

324
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,759
My exclusive matchmaker

325
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:12,039
what

326
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,920
I'm on a blind date website

327
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,119
VIP member registered

328
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,480
Exclusive matchmaker one-to-one service

329
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:19,720
Don't you say

330
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,799
This paid tens of thousands of dollars

331
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:21,960
Really different

332
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,279
The person he introduced to me

333
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:24,400
It's either rich or expensive

334
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,680
I think you can also try

335
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
No time, no energy

336
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:28,880
Not interested

337
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,839
I'm serious

338
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,480
Even if you can't find anyone

339
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,519
Live together

340
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:35,079
You can find someone to partner with you to start a business

341
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:36,559
Is it right?

342
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:13,519
what happened to you

343
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,480
Chen Yiming transferred you 800,000

344
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,640
He still has a conscience

345
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:28,319
Do you have white wine in your house

346
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:30,519
I'm going to die

347
00:26:33,319 --> 00:26:34,359
I'll find it for you

348
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:34,920
Find it for you

349
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:19,440
If not handling other business

350
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,759
Please remove the bank card in time

351
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:51,000
Yu Wei

352
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:52,920
Mom wants to talk to you

353
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,279
Discuss something

354
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:54,880
Ok

355
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,960
Let's not buy shoes

356
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,759
Wear the old ones first

357
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,559
But the teacher said

358
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,640
My dancing shoes are broken

359
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,240
Need a new one

360
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,200
Mom will help you make up

361
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,920
The kids are all wearing new dancing shoes

362
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:20,759
The old dancing shoes are patched up

363
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:22,359
Can dance

364
00:28:22,599 --> 00:28:25,160
I want new dancing shoes too

365
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,279
Mom doesn't have enough money

366
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:38,160
Didn't you just withdraw the money?

367
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,160
This is my father's hospital fee

368
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:43,839
And your kindergarten tuition

369
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,240
And our electricity bill

370
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,799
Water, gas, telephone

371
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:50,640
Daddy is not

372
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,400
Do you have money every month

373
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,680
Dad is hospitalized and has no money

374
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:00,240
Is your money enough?

375
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:08,960
Don't worry about it

376
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,720
Mom i have money

377
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,880
What money do you have

378
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:20,000
I eat first today

379
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:21,920
Do exercises first

380
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,559
Teacher rewarded

381
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,640
Can be in the fairy tale house

382
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,960
Buy crayons buy bows

383
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,920
This lottery can't buy dancing shoes

384
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,559
I don't need dancing shoes

385
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:40,039
Mom, this money is for you to spend

386
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,640
Future mother

387
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,119
I must buy it for you

388
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:50,839
Many new dance shoes

389
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:51,359
Ok

390
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:08,559
what do you mean

391
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:09,079
Go! Go! Go

392
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,880
I have never seen you like this

393
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,000
You are simply

394
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,359
Let me post money to help you decorate

395
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,440
Twenty six five

396
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,359
Miss Li

397
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:23,200
You are the boss

398
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:24,680
You are such a piece of fifty cents

399
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,640
Bargain with me

400
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,720
Is this interesting

401
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,920
Brother, I know it's boring

402
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:32,000
I want to wave my hand boldly

403
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,079
OK, that's it

404
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:35,240
But the money in my hand is not allowed

405
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,119
Don't say it's a fifty cents

406
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,519
I am a penny now

407
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:40,039
I want to break the two halves of flowers

408
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,240
Then we have to make money

409
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,079
Have to eat too

410
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,680
Now order a decent box lunch

411
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,680
It's fifteen yuan each

412
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,079
I ate eight yuan for lunch

413
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,640
Miss Li

414
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,359
How much can you pay?

415
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:52,880
My renovation budget

416
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:53,880
Only three hundred thousand

417
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,599
This price

418
00:30:56,039 --> 00:30:56,599
All Shanghai

419
00:30:56,599 --> 00:30:58,079
No decoration company can do

420
00:30:59,039 --> 00:30:59,640
lowest

421
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:01,680
Five hundred and eighty thousand

422
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:04,240
Three hundred and two thousand

423
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:06,279
I knew it

424
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,279
I won't come

425
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,359
Isn't this taking time?

426
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:25,519
Manager Chen

427
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:43,920
President Wang

428
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:55,079
Why are you staying up late lately?

429
00:31:58,599 --> 00:31:59,160
No

430
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,319
How about Siyu

431
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:12,640
we broke up

432
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:26,920
or

433
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:28,680
How about I ask her again

434
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,039
You guys have a good chat

435
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,279
no need

436
00:32:32,599 --> 00:32:33,920
It's fine now

437
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,160
Both of us

438
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:39,000
All relieved, all relaxed

439
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,440
It's not easy for you to look at

440
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,519
Maybe I still pay

441
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:53,839
Just not used to it

442
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:54,920
Get used to it

443
00:32:58,759 --> 00:32:59,720
I'm here, Mr. Wang

444
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,319
Ok

445
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,200
Yiming

446
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:08,559
Want relief

447
00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:10,039
Really let go

448
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,640
If you want to find someone to solve

449
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:15,920
I'm here

450
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,640
Thank you, sister Ziru

451
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,279
I go first

452
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:41,880
Here here can be finished today

453
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,720
Over here

454
00:33:45,079 --> 00:33:45,839
Rest assured

455
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,240
Anyway at the end of this month

456
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,200
Definitely finished

457
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,799
Come, let me give

458
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,839
Boss Li

459
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,000
here

460
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,200
Siyu sister

461
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,319
Zhizhi

462
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,160
there

463
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,199
Speak quietly here

464
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:15,000
Cleaner

465
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:17,518
How do you dress

466
00:34:17,518 --> 00:34:18,678
Same as migrant workers

467
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:20,440
I am a migrant worker now

468
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,400
These jobs

469
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,599
Don't have to do it yourself

470
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:26,719
Save money by doing it yourself

471
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:28,679
What does the decoration company do?

472
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:30,360
My money

473
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:32,199
The decoration company doesn't even make a profit

474
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:33,000
No answer

475
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,840
I can only find workers by myself

476
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,719
Lead

477
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,159
can you

478
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,199
No money

479
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,480
Anything

480
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,360
Why are you looking for me

481
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,159
Nothing

482
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,079
I just came to see you

483
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:48,559
need some help

484
00:34:51,518 --> 00:34:52,799
I still have

485
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,519
One million funding gap

486
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,440
How about you make up for me

487
00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:00,239
I am teasing you

488
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:04,880
Miss Li, help

489
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:06,559
coming

490
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:07,320
You go busy

491
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:08,679
Then I don't care about you

492
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:09,400
You pay attention to safety

493
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:09,880
it is good

494
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,320
Mr. Pan

495
00:35:43,719 --> 00:35:44,159
Ok

496
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,440
You are looking for me

497
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,440
Nothing

498
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:50,400
Just sorted the cabinet

499
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,639
Found something

500
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:54,880
Special touch

501
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:55,719
Ok

502
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:56,960
Ok

503
00:36:09,079 --> 00:36:09,559
This

504
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:11,880
look carefully

505
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,679
This tie is yours

506
00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:15,320
mine

507
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:16,880
you forgot

508
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:18,960
At the beginning

509
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:20,760
Emerald was established soon

510
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:22,360
Going to visit a leader

511
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:24,599
You take this tie

512
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,519
Untie from my neck

513
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:27,320
Tie me

514
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,800
You still said that

515
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,119
Mr. Pan

516
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:34,480
You are the face of emerald

517
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,760
It's okay if we are sloppy

518
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:38,679
You must be glamorous

519
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,880
I seem to be impressed

520
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,159
Then the business was successful

521
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:48,320
I bought a lot of ties

522
00:36:50,119 --> 00:36:51,119
But this one alone

523
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,159
Keep it

524
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,360
Reluctant to return you

525
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,760
It records

526
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,719
Your contribution to Emerald

527
00:36:58,079 --> 00:36:58,840
and also

528
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:01,760
The friendship of working hard together

529
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:03,719
That seems to be

530
00:37:03,719 --> 00:37:05,239
More than ten years ago

531
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,880
Yes, more than ten years ago

532
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:10,960
that time

533
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,239
I bring a technician

534
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,960
In the lab

535
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,880
Boil all night

536
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,159
How about you

537
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,079
Bring the sales team

538
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:21,320
Run across China

539
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,280
Have today's family business

540
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:25,360
I remember that

541
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:27,400
I went to Zhengzhou on a business trip

542
00:37:27,719 --> 00:37:28,480
Before departure

543
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,800
Your hair is all black

544
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,800
Less than a month

545
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,719
Turned white when I came back

546
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:36,880
I also remember

547
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,239
Three hundred and sixty-five days a year

548
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:41,719
You have been on business for 300 days

549
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,320
More than sixty days left

550
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,599
You are working overtime most of the time

551
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,159
Just because of this

552
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,920
Your ex-wife divorced you

553
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:53,679
Right

554
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,760
We are

555
00:37:58,519 --> 00:37:59,639
Have paid too much

556
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:00,400
Correct

557
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:02,840
We all paid too much for Emerald

558
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,519
But your friendship

559
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,559
No one can replace it

560
00:38:09,559 --> 00:38:10,400
Yes

561
00:38:14,199 --> 00:38:14,920
sit

562
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:23,599
We have been busy these two years

563
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,480
Communication is less than before

564
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:28,559
The company is getting bigger

565
00:38:29,239 --> 00:38:30,400
The market has changed again

566
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,320
We started to disagree

567
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:35,679
Fang Zhan, it's okay

568
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:38,440
Here with me

569
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,920
in my heart

570
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:45,039
You have always been the best brother

571
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:47,599
Partner

572
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:50,880
Yes

573
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,280
It used to be so difficult

574
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:55,840
Let's all carry over

575
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,039
Maybe more difficult later

576
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,119
Let's carry it together, okay

577
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:09,599
Mr. Pan, tell the truth

578
00:39:11,559 --> 00:39:12,480
I'm a little tired

579
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,480
why

580
00:39:18,519 --> 00:39:19,360
today

581
00:39:19,639 --> 00:39:20,800
Too difficult to do business

582
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:22,719
We invested hundreds of millions

583
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:23,920
All year round

584
00:39:24,679 --> 00:39:25,920
Can only earn a few million

585
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:27,599
Ugly

586
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,039
Buy a house

587
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:30,239
Appreciation is faster than this

588
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:41,159
Fang Zhan Fang Zhan

589
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:44,519
When we invested in this industry

590
00:39:44,519 --> 00:39:46,159
Is it just to make money?

591
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,159
If to make money

592
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:49,039
I was

593
00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:50,599
It's time to sell the patent

594
00:39:51,239 --> 00:39:52,360
If to make money

595
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,639
You could invest

596
00:39:53,639 --> 00:39:54,719
Any field

597
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:56,840
We are not done

598
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,960
Our dream

599
00:40:01,159 --> 00:40:01,960
still remember

600
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:03,320
Was it our slogan back then?

601
00:40:03,639 --> 00:40:04,719
Industry Excellence

602
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,119
China's first

603
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:07,360
World leader

604
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,800
We did it

605
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:11,079
One more step

606
00:40:11,079 --> 00:40:12,400
Is the number one in China

607
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,719
Are you going to retreat this time

608
00:40:17,239 --> 00:40:17,800
I

609
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,760
I know Fang Zhan

610
00:40:19,719 --> 00:40:20,440
I know

611
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:23,519
You have worked so hard these two years

612
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,159
I am anxious

613
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:27,159
Made you feel wronged

614
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:28,800
Fang Zhan

615
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:30,239
I promise you that

616
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,000
I will pay attention later

617
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,159
Own working attitude and way

618
00:40:35,159 --> 00:40:35,880
I promise

619
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:36,559
Mr. Pan

620
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:41,320
Actually okay

621
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,280
Lvbao has come to today

622
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,679
Not easy

623
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,639
We must not give up

624
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:56,639
Let's continue

625
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:00,960
Ok

626
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,280
Two days later

627
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,559
I plan to apply to the board of directors

628
00:41:09,159 --> 00:41:10,719
Discuss Emerald III again

629
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:13,199
Proposal for two more production lines

630
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:16,039
I hope you support me

631
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,599
same as before

632
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:20,639
Ok

633
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:23,960
How is Liu Yang

634
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:26,079
There are a few more indicators

635
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:27,119
Did not come down

636
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,440
The doctor said I will live for a while

637
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:31,079
I asked

638
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,159
This disease

639
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,400
Can't be anxious, can't be tired

640
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,239
Have to be raised slowly

641
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:36,480
How are you

642
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,239
Hello, Xiao Liu. Long time no see

643
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:44,800
Auntie just paid her salary

644
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,079
Yuwei, order whatever you want

645
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:47,239
Aunt

646
00:41:47,239 --> 00:41:49,400
Do you have a lot of money

647
00:41:49,519 --> 00:41:50,280
Auntie also wants

648
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,360
Have a lot of money

649
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:53,599
Then you share it with mom

650
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:56,360
What did Yuwei say?

651
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
When we eat fruit

652
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,320
The teacher said

653
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:02,239
Children who can't finish eating

654
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:03,159
Can be divided

655
00:42:03,159 --> 00:42:05,039
For children who are not enough

656
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:06,880
It's not the same thing

657
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,880
Aren't you out of money

658
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:09,679
Yu Wei

659
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,800
No more

660
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,440
Give you another date

661
00:42:29,159 --> 00:42:29,920
Let's see

662
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:42,719
Xiaoling

663
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:43,760
Who let me

664
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,119
I knew you when I was twelve

665
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:50,519
thank you

666
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:51,519
Thank you

667
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:52,480
It's not a big deal

668
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,079
Buy less clothes

669
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:55,320
Let Siyu for a while

670
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,039
I'll get you some too

671
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,440
Don't, don't tell her about it

672
00:43:00,199 --> 00:43:00,840
how

673
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:02,880
You didn't find

674
00:43:03,199 --> 00:43:04,880
Is she worried about money now?

675
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,400
Doesn't she have a lot of money?

676
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:12,199
I went to see her the other day

677
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:14,800
No wonder

678
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:15,800
She now even has hand cream

679
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:16,960
Have to rub me

680
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,360

In the vehicle battery service market

684
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:23,000

Leading brand

See you in our company next Monday

688
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:39,119
Won another talent

689
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:42,440
Where did you just say

690
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:45,079

Siyu

700
00:44:25,159 --> 00:44:26,320
My friend told me just now

701
00:44:26,679 --> 00:44:28,199
During the Emerald Tender Disturbance

702
00:44:28,519 --> 00:44:30,119
A company called Langfei

703
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:31,519
Spent 40,000 to buy the navy

704
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,519
Create public opinion unfavorable to Emerald

705
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:22,920
Come in

00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,159
Mr. Chen, your takeaway

00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:26,159
it is good

708
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:30,519
I didn't order takeaway

709
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,320
You ordered for me

710
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,199
not me

711
00:45:34,039 --> 00:45:35,239
OK, you go ahead

00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,599
Eat well and exercise

713
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,239
Take a good rest and work hard
