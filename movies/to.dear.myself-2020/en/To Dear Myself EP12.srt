Lin Ling

7
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,719
I was in a bad mood last week

8
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,520
I shouldn't have thrown a tantrum

9
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:13,599
Sorry

10
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:14,680
No, sister Siyu

11
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:16,400
I'm so stupid

12
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,919
Don't worry

13
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:19,400
I will learn the lesson

14
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:21,800

How did you make it?

22
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:42,039
Sister Yuan scolded me

23
00:02:42,325 --> 00:02:45,919
Then I looked for orders crazily out of anger

24
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,800
And I set a record

28
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,639
You should go to have a look

29
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:47,199

You are going to be copywriter of Fenglin Company, right?

58
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:27,996
They barely give me an interview

59
00:09:30,275 --> 00:09:32,720
You can go to work for president Guo

60
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,440
I call president Guo now

61
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:40,950
I won't go to his company

62

I just do not understand

63
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,679
Why do you resist it so?

64

65
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:50,840
Say it

My girlfriend sells her smile to find a job for me

00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:22,200
Where do you know the data on the second line of page 13?

200
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,159
You are still in the office?

201
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:25,600
Yes

202
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:27,440
Did you have dinner?

203
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:28,840
Not yet

204
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:29,960
What time is this?

205
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,000
Why you didn't have dinner?

206
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:32,600
I didn't have the time

207
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,279
What are you doing?

208
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:38,550
I am working on the reports you need tomorrow morning

209
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:41,960
Those reports are great

210
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,960
Don't need to waste your time

211
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:44,519
No

212
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:45,639
Brother Yang

213
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:47,360
You are responsible for the project

214
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:50,250
I need to make it perfect

215
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,879
I need you to go home now

216
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:57,159
It's ok, brother Yang

217
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:57,840
Never mind me

218
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,725
I will give you the most perfect report tomorrow morning

219
00:17:46,359 --> 00:17:48,759
Brother Yang, why are you here?

220
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:54,759
I bought you some food

221
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,400
And porridge. Eat while it's warm

222
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,680
What's wrong?

223
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:38,400
Brother Yang, please don't be so good to me

224
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,480
Don't think too much

225
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,960
Sister Yun 

226
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,480
You...

227
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,425
No one is so good to me

228
00:19:58,599 --> 00:19:59,359
Brother Yang 

229
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:03,039
I love you

230
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,799
What is her name?

231
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,319
Her name is...

232
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,839
Yang, you are back

233
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,559
Did you have dinner?

234
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:56,559
Social engagement, I know you would come back late

235
00:20:56,759 --> 00:20:57,920
Come back so early?

236
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,759
Drink too much and now feel uncomfortable?

237
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,920
With whom did you have dinner?

238
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:41,920
Old friends

239
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:43,279
Men or women?

240
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,920
Men and women, what's the matter?

241
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,880
The perfume on your clothes is so thick

242
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,400
I never use perfume

243
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,800
Guess, who organized the dinner tonight?

244
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,680
Who?

245
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:02,960
Yuan Huizhong of your company

246
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,599
Why it's her?

247
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:09,000
All about the tender

248
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,480
She invites her friends and her friends invite me

249
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,359
Stay away from her

250
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,759
She is Siyu's rival

251
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,878
Even without Li Siyu, I will still stay away from her

252
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:19,920
Why?

253
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:23,359
Your manager Yuan is so unbelievable

254
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:24,599
She runs directly into my arms

255
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:26,319
Bitch

256
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:27,720
She even tried to get me drunk

257
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:29,519
Li and others are ridiculous too

258
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,440
I think they get some benefits

259
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,759
They help her inebriate me

260
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,160
Then I slipped away

261
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,319
I need to take a shower now

262
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:51,599
It happened last night?

263
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,319
Liu Yang was terrified

264
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:57,400
He still had lingering fears after he came home

265
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:01,680
She wants to get the tender, too

266
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:10,050
Now I know the rumors about her are true

267
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:11,920
Usually she won't do this

268
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:14,640
She pushes herself so hard probably because of me

269
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,720
Don't worry

270
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,359
Liu Yang will stay away from her

271
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:21,839
Zhizhi

272
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,279
You should keep an eye on Liu Yang

273
00:23:24,625 --> 00:23:27,025
Otherwise in the end, I will lose the order

274
00:23:27,025 --> 00:23:28,559
and you will lose your husband 

275
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:34,079
I and Liu Yang have many bumps these years

276
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,075
We won't have any problem

277
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,559
I trust brother Yang 

278
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,480
But he just can't resist her temptation

279
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:57,880
Morning

280
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,839
Morning

281
00:23:58,839 --> 00:23:59,640
Morning

282
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,359
Morning

283
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,240
Sister Yun

284
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,425
I think you have some misunderstandings about me

285
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:15,079
I care about you

286
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:17,680
Because I am your leader

287
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:20,039
teacher and brother

288
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,000
I mean nothing else

289
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,559
I know

290
00:25:32,125 --> 00:25:36,839
But what I want to say is...

291
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:43,319
I...

292
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,720
I am not a casual girl

293
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:52,279
I really...

294
00:25:55,079 --> 00:25:56,480
I really fall in love with you

295
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,880
I am married

296
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,119
I have a wife and a daughter

297
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,279
I have to be responsible for my family

298
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,359
Brother Yang, don't worry

299
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:32,300
I mean no harm

300
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,480
I will never disturb your family

301
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:38,720
I won't disturb you, either

302
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:44,279
I just want to look at you from a distance

303
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,480
I want to help you every day

304
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:49,960
That's all

305
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:51,400
You...

306
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,920
It's not ok

307
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:01,240
I promise

308
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:06,925
What happened last night will never happen again

309
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,025
I will contain myself

310
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:14,559
You are young

311
00:27:16,525 --> 00:27:18,166
You have many possibilities in the future

312
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:29,604
My future is to love you silently

313
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,559
You can't do that

314
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,319
I will do as you say

315
00:27:44,925 --> 00:27:48,039
No matter how hard it is

316
00:27:49,975 --> 00:27:52,279
But you can't stop me loving you

317
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:56,599
You can't do it

318
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,240
I can't even do it myself

319
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:20,240
Liu scolded you?

320
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:25,720
Liu

321
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,960
I put the report you want on your table

322
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,680
Thank you

323
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,680
Liu

324
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,519
Three o'clock in the afternoon

325
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:35,425
I want to see around Dongfeng factory with Wei Yayun

326
00:28:36,599 --> 00:28:37,960
Wei Yayun worked overtime yesterday

327
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:39,799
She needs to go home early today

328
00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:40,640
You should go with someone else

329
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:42,160
Ok

330
00:28:44,839 --> 00:28:46,079
Brother Dai

331
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:47,079
Come with me this afternoon

332
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,680
My filing name is

333
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,160
the tender of Guangcai Engineering 

334
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,680
Construction Company's lighting project

335
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:00,519
Customer representative is Liu Yang

336
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:03,039
Sister Yuan's filing name is

337
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:04,160
tender of street light

338
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,079
customer representative is to be determined

339
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,559
When did she file it?

340
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:09,599
16th of this month

341
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:13,880
I filed on the 13th

342
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:14,839
Correct

343
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:16,000
It's 13th

344
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:17,279
Great

345
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:18,920
I was too impatient yesterday

346
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:19,920
I scared him

347
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:22,240
What should we do next?

348
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:25,920
Let's adjust the rhythm

349
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:29,400
Later I will send him an apology with SMS

350
00:29:30,425 --> 00:29:33,039
Days later, we will tell Mr. Li to invite him a cup of coffee

351
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:35,079
What should I prepare?

352
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:42,640
Get some materials in administrative department

353
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:44,600
Only talk about business this time

354
00:29:45,079 --> 00:29:45,920
Go

355
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:51,119
Xiao Tang

356
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:52,160
What?

357
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,880
I need the product brochures and videos

358
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:56,279
And the set of corporate culture introduction

359
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,480
Wait a moment, I'll get it for you

360
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,700
Sister Yuan never gives client this kind of stuff, right?

361
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,799
Don't mention it

362
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,400
Last night we met a strange person

363
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,640
Desperate times, desperate measures

364
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:14,200
Strange

365
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:16,079
Guess what

366
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:17,839
Really?

367
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,119
He ran away

368
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,880
Sister Yuan failed in the end?

369
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,440
Yeah, he ran away

370
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,599
Zhizhi

371
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:53,599
Stop

372
00:30:57,119 --> 00:30:58,279
Are you deaf?

373
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,359
Liu Jie, you have nothing to do?

374
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:06,319
You have the time for this?

375
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:07,960
Sister Yuan, I'm angry

376
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:12,079
Liu Jie

377
00:31:12,575 --> 00:31:14,500
Her mom didn't teach her decorum and the sense of shame

378
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,775
Never mind her

379
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,759
You have no sense of shame

380
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:21,759
What are you talking about?

381
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:23,839
Apologize to me

382
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:24,720
No way

383
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,119
Will you apologize?

384
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:27,200
Let me go

385
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:28,839
You know what you are doing?

386
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,440
You shrew

387
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,240
Come here

388
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,759
You shameless

389
00:31:32,759 --> 00:31:33,400
What?

390
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:35,839
What are you doing?

391
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:40,400
Li Siyu  -Sister Yuan

392
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
You push me

393
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,079
You hit sister Yuan

394
00:31:43,079 --> 00:31:43,799
Come here, sister Yuan

395
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:44,519
How can you hit Sister yuan?

396
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:45,559
Sister Yuan, listen to me

397
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,118
Hit me?

398
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,200
Stop

399
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:53,039
Go home if you don't work

400
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,960
Have you finished your work?

401
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,799
Go

402
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,079
The final decision is as follows

403
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:29,392
Team leaders Yuan Huizhong and Li Siyu will be fined 5,000 yuan

404
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,720
and be criticized in a circulated notice

405
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:39,400
Zhang Zhizhi and Liu Jie will be fined 1,000

406
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,400
and be criticized in a circulated notice

407
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,960
All clear?

408
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:49,725
Give your fines to finance department in three days

409
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:24,640
I didn't expect we would have a fight

410
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:36,079
Sister Yuan, sorry

411
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,799
I am such a loser

412
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:45,839
I saw you two fight against Zhizhi

413
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:47,119
So I was impulsive

414
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:51,475
But anyway, I shouldn't have fought against you

415
00:33:52,519 --> 00:33:53,480
I want to apologize to you

416
00:33:54,279 --> 00:33:55,599
I'll pay your fine

417
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,839
I don't need your money

418
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:03,799
I don't accept your apology either

419
00:34:07,325 --> 00:34:10,639
So what can I do?

420
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,119
If you still see me as your teacher and 

421
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,920
still remember our previous friendship

422
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:21,679
you need to fulfill your promise

423
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:24,760
You won't compete against me for the director

424
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,159
Sister Yuan

425
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,199
I can't

426
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:36,400
Why?

427
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,400
Because I can't fail team members

428
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:44,075
Because I want to be sales director

429
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:46,119
Also because

430
00:34:47,875 --> 00:34:51,400
You don't see me as an apprentice

431
00:34:52,725 --> 00:34:55,119
You don't care about our friendship

432
00:34:57,199 --> 00:34:59,000
Why I don't see you as an apprentice?

433
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:02,725
Without me, you should have been fired long ago

434
00:35:03,525 --> 00:35:05,639
I have cleaned your mess a lot

435
00:35:05,639 --> 00:35:07,360
Why I don't care about our friendship?

436
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,639
Li Siyu

437
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:18,675
We are so like The Farmer and the Snake

438
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,199
Sister Yuan

439
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:28,250
If I make you unhappy, that's because you force me to do so

440
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,559
Li Siyu, let me tell you

441
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:37,440
I will be the sales director

442
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,239
The first thing I do when I become the sales director

443
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,239
is to fire you

444
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,440
Sister Yuan

445
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,782
I will be the sales director

446
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,475
The first thing after I become the director is to thank you

447
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,719
Just you and your waste?

448
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,119
Yes

449
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:01,400
Just with my strength

450
00:36:01,639 --> 00:36:02,840
and with my ability to lead the team

451
00:36:03,075 --> 00:36:05,199
and my dark horses

452
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:07,920
Well

453
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,675
I am preparing for a tender on behalf of our company

454
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:14,039
Guangcai company lighting project renovation

455
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:15,840
Total bid of 28 million

456
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:17,280
It's my project

457
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:25,440
Sorry

458
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,920
This time I filed first

459
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:43,025
President Pan, I am sorry for the misbehavior of the sales department

460
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,000
Supervision department happened this before

461
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,679
Learn from the lesson, hope it won't happen again

462
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,150
You leave sales department to me

463
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:55,975
I can't shirk the respon...

464
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,679
The more people we have, the more conflict we have

465
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,199
It's inevitable

466
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:06,519
It's a good thing that two teams compete with each other

467
00:37:06,519 --> 00:37:08,825
But they need to have a rule

468
00:37:09,275 --> 00:37:13,300
In order to grab clients, they have many troubles

469
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,800
I think we should do something

470
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,559
Go on

471
00:37:21,825 --> 00:37:25,199
I think we should ask client department for cooperation

472
00:37:26,025 --> 00:37:31,450
We should divide the section for the two teams

473
00:37:31,775 --> 00:37:33,760
Then they will work in their own area

474
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,719
Which can develop the client's potential

475
00:37:38,475 --> 00:37:42,480
and vicious competition can be avoided

476
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,000
So how to divide the section?

477
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:51,250
Li Siyu knows about electric car market well

478
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:52,840
We should leave it to her

479
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:56,360
Yuan Huizhong has some great clients

480
00:37:56,679 --> 00:37:57,880
But for the company's overall situation

481
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,960
I think we should leave it to Li Siyu

482
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:04,800
Will Yuan Huizhong agree?

483
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,119
I will persuade her

484
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:12,925
I think we should leave toy market, small appliances 

485
00:38:12,925 --> 00:38:14,679
and medical equipment to Li Siyu too

486
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,639
Because she is so familiar with these industries

487
00:38:17,639 --> 00:38:19,000
Same client

488
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,199
Others can only get about 20 million

489
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:24,225
But she can make 30 million or even 40 million

490
00:38:26,725 --> 00:38:30,159
Is it unfair to other salesmen?

491
00:38:31,425 --> 00:38:34,622
It can develop others' sales performance wiht maximum limit

492
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:38,159
For example, Yuan Huizhong

493
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:41,239
She is very familiar with government public relations

494
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,425
We can leave government-related projects to her

495
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,199
Of course she will think 

496
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:49,159
Electric car market is a large one

497
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:50,559
Why should we leave it to Li Siyu?

498
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:54,200
But for the company, she needs to sacrifice when time comes

499
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:00,950
I think a good competition mechanism

500
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,415
is to mobilize all people's enthusiasm and potential

501
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:08,500
Not to sacrifice one for the other

502
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:13,650
But now the sales department is a bit messy

503
00:39:14,199 --> 00:39:15,239
It's only the appearance

504
00:39:16,679 --> 00:39:18,239
As long as performance continues to grow

505
00:39:18,675 --> 00:39:20,760
it shows the mechanism is effective

506
00:39:22,039 --> 00:39:23,239
According to the previous rules

507
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:26,719
Whoever files first will have the client

508
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,039
Ok

509
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:50,280
Sister Siyu

510
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,480
I have paid the fine for you

511
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,159
You don't need to pay it

512
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,559
I will transfer the money to you

513
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,559
No need

514
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:03,550
You should save the salary for Yuwei

515
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,159
How can I thank you?

516
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:10,199
I want to eat your dishes

517
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:17,100
Ok, you and brother Yiming come to eat at my home

518
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,960
I have to work overtime tonight

519
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,559
See the client?

520
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:26,639
Sister Siyu

521
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:30,039
You fought against them for me

522
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:33,325
Will it affect your competition with Yuan Huizhong?

523
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:34,960
No

524
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:35,960
Really?

525
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:37,760
Do not worry

526
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,559
I will win this time

527
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,480
Well

528
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:46,480
Did Yiming get a job?

529
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,400
He plans to work in his hometown

530
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:53,880
How about you?

531
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,360
I will stay here

532
00:40:56,199 --> 00:40:57,800
You will be separated

533
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,880
No way

534
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:01,880
Sister Siyu

535
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:04,000
You should persuade brother Yiming

536
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:12,760
I want to quit

537
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:18,320
Don't say like that

538
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:24,280
Brother, I'm so tired

539
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:25,960
Who is not tired?

540
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,000
I am tired too

541
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:35,559
Do you know what I want to do most?

542
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,679
First of all, I want to take care of my body

543
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:43,599
Then I will eat three simple meals a day

544
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:51,850
Then I will stay with my son and see him do homework

545
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:54,360
Then I will find a boyfriend

546
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:56,760
I will lead a regular life

547
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:00,679
All these can be achieved

548
00:42:01,425 --> 00:42:04,280
But you can't give up now

549
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:10,475
Li Siyu's team is going crazy

550
00:42:11,639 --> 00:42:13,199
I really don't want to compete with them

551
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,639
Why not? You must

552
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:25,559
Huizhong

553
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,880
I only told you about this

554
00:42:30,525 --> 00:42:33,679
Whether you defeat Li Siyu will influence all people's interests

555
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:35,760
It will also influence my survival in Lubao

556
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,639
Moreover, it's about the survival of Lubao

557
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,800
We have talked about this many times

558
00:42:43,159 --> 00:42:44,920
I don't care if I get out

559
00:42:45,559 --> 00:42:46,880
But I am worried about Lubao

560
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:50,374
Yes, Pan Zhiyong is the founder of Lubao

561
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:52,125
But over the past ten years

562
00:42:52,125 --> 00:42:57,734
we sacrifice less blood, youth, sweat than Pan Zhiyong?

563
00:43:00,199 --> 00:43:03,125
We can't see him destroy Lubao

564
00:43:07,079 --> 00:43:09,650
And Pan Zhiyong never cares about benefits

565
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:11,650
 of executives and employees

566
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:15,050
I tried so hard to get equity allocations

567
00:43:16,425 --> 00:43:19,119
If I am out, he will have the final say

568
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,119
In the future, our interests won't be guaranteed

569
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:26,025
Including your shares

570
00:43:28,679 --> 00:43:29,760
He can do it

571
00:43:32,625 --> 00:43:36,320
So we need to win sales department

572
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:40,039
The company is preparing for equity financing

573
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:42,921
As long as you can persist till the new shareholders come

574
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,519
we have a chance

575
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:47,519
Then we will turn the table

576
00:43:56,199 --> 00:43:57,760
