Chen Xinyi

3
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:38,280
No. 1 in performance this month

4
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,079
Congratulations

00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,519
Treat

00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:41,159
no problem

7
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,280
Liu Jie

8
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:49,719
The worst landslide

9
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,760
Old rules fine

10
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,400
President Yuan, I agree

11
00:01:58,719 --> 00:01:59,439
Cai Yihui

12
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,760
Congratulations

13
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:04,120
This month is not the last

14
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,080
Someone is worse than Cai Yihui

15
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,280
Cai Yihui Five hundred and twenty thousand

16
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,240
Zhang Zhizhi

17
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:20,639
zero

18
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,199
Zhang Zhizhi

19
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:23,639
I'm not

20
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:25,080
Did you give you a client

21
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,240
What about the order

22
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,000
The client kicked me out

23
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:32,039
and then

24
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:36,639
Then you never contacted

25
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:37,439
This customer

26
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,280
You are so arrogant

27
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:47,520
Rejected by the client

28
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,120
Never contact again

29
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:50,919
So arrogant

30
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:52,280
Should be the chairman

31
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:54,240
What salesperson

32
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:58,800
Zhang Zhizhi

33
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,360
I limit you this month

34
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,960
Must win this client

35
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,159
Can't hold

36
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:05,240
Leave by yourself

37
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,800
Cai Yihui

38
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,400
You should be the entire sales department

39
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,919
The one who doesn't want her to leave

40
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:11,039
As long as she is

41
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:12,439
You are not the last one

42
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:16,199
Be merciful

43
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,319
You have become kind

44
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:19,520
All right

45
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,879
One more good news

46
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:21,800
Tell everyone

47
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,400
This month our sales department

48
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,000
Won the Team Excellence Award

49
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:25,800
Congratulations everyone

50
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:31,719
Everyone, keep working hard

51
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,319
Come on

52
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:27,079
Zhizhi Zhizhi

53
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,000
Are you OK

54
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,240
Paid

55
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,160
Every month

56
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,639
Isn't it all paid today?

57
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:38,800
Base salary

58
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,680
Plus various subsidies from the sales department

59
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:45,480
Plus the bonus of the excellent team

60
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,879
In the administration department than I was before

61
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,680
30% more

62
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:55,839
But next month

63
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,680
You are leaving

64
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:07,480
I must stay here

65
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:09,959
Hit someone to lose money

66
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:11,399
fraud company

67
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,399
Manager Li

68
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:13,279
Manager Li

69
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:15,160
fraud company

70
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:16,680
Big brother, scam company

71
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,720
Have something to say

72
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,800
Have something to say

73
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,800
Where's the boss

74
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,240
Tell me your boss

75
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:22,120
Where's your boss

76
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,680
I am

77
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,519
Call your boss out

78
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,600
Your guy beat my husband

79
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,120
Still not willing to lose money

80
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,800
what

81
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,160
Big brother

82
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:34,160
Guan Xiaotang, are you okay?

83
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,120
Can't hurt people

84
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,240
Why are you losing money

85
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:37,879
let me go

86
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:39,120
Can you get up

87
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,160
Take away

88
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:41,800
Be honest

89
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,680
Let us go let me go

90
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:43,800
Let us go

91
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,879
let me go

92
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:46,680
It's okay

93
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,240
All right

94
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:48,639
Nothing

95
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:50,279
my husband

96
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:51,480
The user they called

97
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,120
Her husband

98
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,920
At the service point we called

99
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,439
Rent a new battery

100
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,000
All returned are scrap batteries

101
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,519
Was discovered by our employees

102
00:05:58,519 --> 00:05:59,639
Fight on the spot

103
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:01,240
My husband was seriously injured by him

104
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,040
Medical expenses are several thousand yuan a day

105
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,480
They won't pay a penny

106
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,040
The beating employee has been

107
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,279
Detained by the local police station

108
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,120
This employee and franchisee

109
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,839
Built between them

110
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:11,120
Is a labor contract relationship

111
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:12,199
This matter

112
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:13,199
Should be borne by the franchisee

113
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:13,959
Joint liability

114
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:15,160
And we called

115
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,040
And franchisees

116
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,839
We are an independent civil subject

117
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,920
So this matter

118
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,879
Shouldn't we call

119
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:20,480
Responsible

120
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,160
You say yes

121
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,560
He still doesn't make sense

122
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,160
My husband is like this

123
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:25,319
Unwilling to pay a penny

124
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,720
Does it make sense?

125
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,639
Is there a king?

126
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:28,879
Let's listen to comrades from the police

127
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:29,360
it's OK

128
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,079
okay

129
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:31,439
This is the police station

130
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,279
Comrade Police

131
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:53,519
My husband is lying now

132
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:54,519
In the intensive care unit

133
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:56,600
Waiting for money to help

134
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,439
We can't help it

135
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,319
But if you seek compensation

136
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,879
Should go to that franchisee

137
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,800
but now

138
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,800
You hit someone

139
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,759
Employee who called

140
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,040
Smashed other people's things

141
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:10,639
Already constituted a crime

142
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:14,959
how about it

143
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,920
Whether you both accept mediation

144
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,000
Mediation works

145
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,720
But with conditions

146
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:24,759
the first

147
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,680
Apologize

148
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:26,720
second

149
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,040
Compensate us for calling the company

150
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,800
All losses

151
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:29,759
what

152
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:31,480
You want us to lose you money

153
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,000
Big brother

154
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,519
This is a list of property losses

155
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:39,680
Including decoration, furniture, labor

156
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,519
This is an estimate

157
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,560
More than 20,000 yuan

158
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:53,000
Nothing less

159
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,079
Little girl

160
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:58,839
Can you take less money?

161
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,600
When you hit my company

162
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,680
Why didn't you expect

163
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,839
One less hammer

164
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:04,000
Not little sister

165
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:04,720
My elder brother

166
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,759
Really not intentional

167
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,199
It's just a momentary rush

168
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,319
I apologize to you now

169
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,600
Sorry girl

170
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:12,160
please

171
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:15,839
Forget it

172
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:16,879
I won't let you lose

173
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:18,519
But you have to

174
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:19,480
Write a written guarantee

175
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:21,519
Stop harassing our company

176
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:22,439
Not because

177
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:24,079
Your fight with franchisees

178
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:25,639
Come to trouble our company

179
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:26,759
This

180
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,279
Alright

181
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,279
Make a decision quickly

182
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,679
I write

183
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:02,919
Manager Li

184
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:05,159
I was worried before

185
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:06,519
Our company's brand

186
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:07,879
Because of the fight

187
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,039
did not expect

188
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:10,320
These few words today

189
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:11,720
Our company this time

190
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,320
I'm completely out of it

191
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,799
Am I too cold-blooded

192
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:16,519
Ok

193
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:18,120
Cold-blooded and cool

194
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,399
You go to contact

195
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,320
Franchisees over there

196
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:26,519
Let them as soon as possible

197
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:27,480
Pay the medical bill

198
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,279
I asked them

199
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:30,240
they said

200
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:31,519
How much the court sentenced them to pay

201
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:32,440
They just lose

202
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:34,159
But now the court hasn’t judged

203
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,360
They don't pay a penny

204
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:41,879
Xiao Lu, what do you want to say

205
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,200
Manager Li

206
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:44,759
Before we have a few

207
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:45,840
Service point staff

208
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,200
I haven't had time to train

209
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,080
Go online

210
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,080
This is one of them

211
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:55,200
Do you think it’s because of insufficient training

212
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,960
Led to this fight

213
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,639
how can that be possible

214
00:09:58,879 --> 00:09:59,799
Take scrap batteries

215
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:00,639
Change our new battery

216
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:01,559
Want me to beat him too

217
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:03,399
I do not know either

218
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:05,000
I suddenly remembered

219
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,120
Only the three of us know this

220
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,080
Not allowed to spread

221
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,639
Ok

222
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:11,919
The other employees have not

223
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:13,320
Service points that have time for training

224
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,399
service paused

225
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,559
Until all employees are qualified

226
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,759
OK, let me prepare

227
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:19,639
I'm leaving

228
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,639
You really don't have to go to the hospital

229
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:27,799
No need to

230
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,039
Does it still hurt?

231
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,519
got used to

232
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,519
You get beaten often

233
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,799
My last time

234
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:38,639
Got spanked

235
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,519
You too

236
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:42,799
Hit the hammer

237
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:43,639
Don't know how to hide

238
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:44,799
It's okay to smash the back

239
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:46,080
What should I do if I hit the head?

240
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,200
I didn't think so much at the time

241
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,279
I think they want to do something with you

242
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,120
I'm definitely not happy

243
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,039
I'm anxious

244
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:53,080
You are stupid

245
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,480
I'm not stupid

246
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,080
This this is called love

247
00:10:57,679 --> 00:10:58,639
what did you say

248
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,000
I, I announce

249
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,759
Guan Xiaotang fell in love with Li Siyu

250
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:05,320
Thirty-three days now

251
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,519
Zero five hours

252
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:09,480
Forty-eight minutes and seven seconds

253
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,759
You little kid

254
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:11,799
Understand what love is

255
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,279
I am an early adult

256
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:14,519
I put aside feudal society

257
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:15,320
Now there are groups of early wives and concubines

258
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,200
Children are piled up

259
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,919
You figure it out. I'm your boss

260
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:21,799
Boss, I can't make it either

261
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,080
Can't

262
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:24,440
I can

263
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,519
Let me tell you

264
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,559
You spanked me

265
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:27,320
You harassed me

266
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,600
You are responsible for harassing me

267
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,759
Are you sick

268
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:31,000
I want to be sick

269
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,120
You are medicine

270
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:36,879
Who do you fall

271
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,240
Li Siyu, let me tell you

272
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,639
You have to face this

273
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:07,559
you

274
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,200
what happened to you

275
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:15,159
Why don't you hit me to death

276
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,559
What happened to you

277
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,159
pain

278
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:20,879
It hurts

279
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,440
Walk around

280
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,360
Go to the hospital go to the hospital

281
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:26,960
Stop, stop, wait

282
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,799
Slowly

283
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:35,679
Doctor, is it serious?

284
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,480
Two rib fractures

285
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,039
Fortunately there is no misalignment

286
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,000
Are you stupid

287
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:45,320
Two broken ribs

288
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,240
I don't even know

289
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,799
Me me me me

290
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,519
Many fractures

291
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,080
It was only a slight pain at first

292
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,919
Coupled with different individual sensitivity

293
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:55,759
so

294
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:56,840
It's normal not to know

295
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:00,320
Need to be hospitalized

296
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,399
Don't need this

297
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,799
Chest strap external fixation

298
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,639
Then usually

299
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:04,600
Don't do strenuous exercise

300
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,039
Must rest quietly

301
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,320
Check it out regularly

302
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,600
Just two months

303
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,519
Should be able to return to normal

304
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:11,960
Thank you

305
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,559
You take this

306
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,480
Don't come to the company during this time

307
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:24,639
Rest at home

308
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,720
You are so good to me suddenly

309
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:31,759
Go over there

310
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:35,519
That what

311
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:36,600
Let's go see

312
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,279
What are they plotting

313
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:39,480
Is not

314
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:41,639
What if it's bad for our company

315
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,080
go

316
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:44,519
Look

317
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:48,919
Brother, think of a solution

318
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,720
The hospital urged so many times

319
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,799
What can I do if I don't pay?

320
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:56,080
Younger siblings

321
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:57,879
Listen to my advice

322
00:13:58,279 --> 00:13:59,480
This is the only way

323
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:02,120
Brother, the doctor said

324
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,240
He is getting better

325
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:05,000
Maybe in a few days

326
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,120
He is out of danger

327
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,480
I borrowed everything that should be borrowed

328
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:09,039
I also borrowed things that shouldn't be borrowed

329
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,200
I am now

330
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,200
Can't think of a way

331
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,600
Where to get money

332
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,320
But there is a little way

333
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:16,480
I won't come up with

334
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,600
This idea comes

335
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:19,399
You don't think about yourself

336
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:21,759
Not for the two babies at home

337
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:24,639
Are there four old people in mind?

338
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:30,639
Let's go

339
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,080
The hateful must have pity

340
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,279
Are you OK

341
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,639
it's all my fault

342
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:50,879
sister

343
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,240
It has nothing to do with you

344
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,320
I was too eager to get it

345
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:00,960
no

346
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:05,480
If the training is in place

347
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:08,120
They can't fight

348
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,279
Sister, don't think so

349
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:13,440
This matter has nothing to do with us

350
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,720
in case

351
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,960
It’s not that I pursue speed

352
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,879
If I can train employees

353
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,159
Implement all

354
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,480
This thing won't happen

355
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:14,320
President Su

356
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,960
I will visit you next time

357
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:25,879
Mom is back

358
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,440
Ok

359
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:27,600
came back

360
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:28,320
Ok

361
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,120
You did it

362
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,360
I watch the video online

363
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,240
Learned from the chef

364
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,720
You never enter the kitchen before

365
00:16:58,039 --> 00:16:59,360
You work so tired every day

366
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,759
I am a person who eats leisurely at home

367
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:03,039
Have to do something

368
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:04,039
Help you share it

369
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,079
Yuwei, have dinner

370
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,240
Come

371
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,200
Sit down

372
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,039
The dishes are cold in a while

373
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,440
You don't care you don't care

374
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,279
I went to the vegetable market today to buy vegetables

375
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:31,920
just got it

376
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:34,640
Food is so expensive now

377
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,359
The living expenses of our family

378
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:42,079
Just that

379
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:45,799
Not bad at all

380
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:47,440
How are you arrogant

381
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,039
Simple to say

382
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,759
Some dishes to buy in the morning

383
00:17:54,759 --> 00:17:55,640
cheaper

384
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,599
Some dishes

385
00:17:56,599 --> 00:17:58,119
20% off after 8pm

386
00:17:58,839 --> 00:17:59,759
little more

387
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:01,799
Was killed online

388
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:06,720
All learning

389
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:09,960
Come

390
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:10,880
Try this

391
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,240
Dad, give me the refrigerator

392
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:19,880
Which is the refrigerator

393
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,480
That one

394
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,079
this is for you

395
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:28,559
Zhizhi, come on

396
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:30,079
you go for rest

397
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,160
Yu Wei

398
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,680
Clothes changed in the morning

399
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,759
Where did you go

400
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:05,279
I washed it

401
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:06,319
And your underwear

402
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:07,599
I washed all of them

403
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:12,759
father

404
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:14,279
Tell me one more

405
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:16,119
The story of a scientist

406
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,680
Scientist's story

407
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,400
Let me tell you

408
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:19,920
Do not

409
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,480
I want my father to tell me

410
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,839
Dad knows many scientists

411
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,759
I've only been with dad for a few days

412
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:26,960
Just hate me

413
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,000
No, I want my father to tell me

414
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:31,319
Good good

415
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,799
Dad washed the dishes first

416
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:33,759
Then tell a story to Yuwei

417
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,319
good or not

418
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:34,839
it is good

419
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:40,039
Yu Wei

420
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,759
Remembered

421
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,240
Can't eat this

422
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:44,400
Because there are peanuts in it

423
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,359
Will make you sick

424
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:46,039
do you know

425
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:47,960
Know there are peanuts in it

426
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,000
Buy it for her

427
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,240
I bought this for you

428
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,839
Dad will finish the dishes in a while

429
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:55,599
Come find you

430
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:02,680
There are not only peanuts

431
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:03,960
And red dates

432
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:05,240
I want you to make up

433
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:46,039
Fell asleep

434
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,319
My junior wants to go back home

435
00:20:57,079 --> 00:20:57,960
Want me

436
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,000
Go to teacher Gao's office

437
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,799
Replace him

438
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,200
Can the body work?

439
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:08,880
No problem working in the laboratory

440
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,119
I asked

441
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,799
Because of the laboratory

442
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:19,759
No results

443
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,799
So the salary is relatively low

444
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,480
Can only be half of the previous

445
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,359
But this home

446
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,720
I can't always rely on you

447
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,720
the first

448
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,039
You can't afford

449
00:21:36,519 --> 00:21:37,240
second

450
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,279
I'm sorry

451
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:46,079
Zhizhi

452
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,400
After this time

453
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,680
I've been a lesson

454
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,200
do not worry

455
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:55,279
When i get back to work

456
00:21:55,759 --> 00:21:56,880
I will repay you

457
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,480
I believe in our home

458
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:01,839
Will be the same as before

459
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:03,920
What do you say

460
00:23:20,119 --> 00:23:20,920
Sister Fan

461
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:21,759
Manager Li

462
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,880
You go to the hospital

463
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,400
Take the medical expenses of the wounded

464
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,240
Paid in advance

465
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,000
Our cash flow is not abundant

466
00:23:28,359 --> 00:23:29,599
But if the money is not given

467
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,240
I can't feel at ease in my life

468
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,559
Ok

469
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,079

Don't you think

00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:26,759
Do we two match well

487
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,799
Match your size

488
00:24:28,279 --> 00:24:29,720

489
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:32,559

Whoever you love has nothing to do with me

493
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:39,519
If you dare to hack my computer

494
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:40,440

I will change another way next time

498
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,720
It's no use changing anything

499
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,640

500
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,319

I like you enough

503
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:49,119

00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,519
Is it too demanding?

597
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:16,400
I also advised myself

598
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,599
It's thirty-two

599
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:19,920
Past this village

600
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,400
There is no such village head

601
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:23,599
Bear with it

602
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:25,759
correct

603
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:26,960
Report to you

604
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,039
I transferred to the sales department

605
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,839
Sales

606
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:34,200
Sister Yuan's men

607
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:34,960
Ok

608
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,839
I always think

609
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:38,559
What you said to me before

610
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:41,240
You said that women must be independent

611
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:41,880
must

612
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,240
I can take care of myself

613
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:46,359
Zhizhi

614
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,880
I have been busy lately

615
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,720
About the call

616
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,799
No time to find you

617
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,680
Is something wrong with you

618
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,440
I'll give you if you need money

619
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,880
I have it here too

620
00:29:57,319 --> 00:29:59,279
You guys have helped me a lot

621
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:00,559
I really appreciate you

622
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:02,480
I can't ask for your money anymore

623
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,240
Or you come to my company

624
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,319
This way

625
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,200
I'm not relying on you

626
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:15,599
Relying on Liu Yang

627
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,359
Recently experienced

628
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:18,599
So many things

629
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,920
I also understand

630
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,039
Can't rely on others anymore

631
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,559
I must rely on myself

632
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,640
So this time

633
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,880
I must stand up by myself

634
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:33,480
this road

635
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:35,319
Not easy

636
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:37,440
Which way is easy

637
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,839
look at you

638
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:41,680
Become chairman

639
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:43,079
Still get beaten

640
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,599
And Xiaoling

641
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:47,680
Looks so pretty

642
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:49,720
Find a boyfriend

643
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:51,759
Not completely satisfied

644
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,480
If you figure it out

645
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,119
I will give you two words

646
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:58,880
Come on

647
00:30:59,240 --> 00:30:59,920
Come on

648
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,000
Do not worry

649
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,279
Me this time

650
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:04,640
I won't be knocked down

651
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,519
For Yuwei

652
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,119
Ok

653
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:07,720
Come

654
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:08,640
Come

655
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:14,759
I'll open the door

656
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:15,160
Ok

657
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,720
Hello, Li Siyu's express

658
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,400

659
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:26,920
mine

660
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,279
Such a big box

661
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,839
You bought something

662
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,640
Sister Siyu, such a big express

663
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,279

664
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:35,359
I'll tear it down

665
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:35,960
what is this

666
00:31:37,319 --> 00:31:38,079
what

667
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:38,839
What did you buy

668
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:40,000
I didn't buy it

669
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,519
A box of money

670
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:43,400
G

671
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:51,119
What is it

672
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:53,839
be careful

673
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,359

00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,319
Have card

675
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,640
Li Siyu, accept me

676
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,880
Explain to me quickly

677
00:32:10,279 --> 00:32:11,119
what happened

678
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,839
Are you so rascal now?

679
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,359
Sister, did you receive the gift?

680
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:26,559
Like it

681
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:30,519
Guan Xiaotang

682
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,880
If you dare to harass me

683
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,839
Get off now

684
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,920
Take a look

685
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:36,759
Throw it away

686
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,319
You do not want

687
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:44,160
You don't like

688
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,079
I want to see you off again

689
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,799
Why don't you throw it away

690
00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:53,279
You don't want me

691
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,000
This is very expensive, look

692
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,000
Who the hell is it

693
00:32:58,279 --> 00:32:59,640
Company kid

694
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:00,559
How small

695
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:01,599
Ninety-eight

696
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:03,559
So small

697
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:04,559
Ok

698
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,400
Actually not very small

699
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,279
Does he like you

700
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,960
I think he is sick

701
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,799
You will make a big move

702
00:33:15,799 --> 00:33:16,799
Don't think too much

703
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:18,039
I have nothing with him

704
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,480
Yeah

705
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,119
You still have to find a reliable one

706
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,200
Or it's a waste of time

707
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,359
Have to find one

708
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:26,279
Someone better than you to take care of you

709
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:29,960
Actually, you can also try

710
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:31,920
Anyway, idle is idle

711
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,960
You let me follow one

712
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,680
You can call me auntie's child

713
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,519
fall in love

714
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,279
Although this kid can't live

715
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,880
But he can warm you

716
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:43,880
You just put him

717
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,680
As a shot of hyaluronic acid

718
00:33:49,079 --> 00:33:49,920
Ha ha

719
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,319
What you said prove again

720
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:53,799
We are not the same

721
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:56,279
Even if we are not the same kind of people

722
00:33:56,319 --> 00:33:57,559
But we can also

723
00:33:57,559 --> 00:33:59,160
Encourage each other

724
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:02,240
All the way

725
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:05,559
Xiaoling, come

726
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,400
Wish you always have hyaluronic acid

727
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,239
Siyu, wish you a prosperous career

728
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,119
Zhizhi, I wish you stronger and stronger

729
00:34:23,518 --> 00:34:24,118
Sorry, handsome guy

730
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:24,840
Keep you waiting

731
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:26,440
Your wine is here

732
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,400
Okay, thank you

733
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,000
Please slow down

734
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,719
Um thanks

735
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,039
Xiao Liu, this table is over

736
00:34:59,400 --> 00:34:59,840
That table

737
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,800
Collect it at that time

738
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,400
it is good

739
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,000
Boss, my skewers

740
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:04,880
Wait a moment

741
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:05,639
it is good

742
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,280
Sister Ziru, I've arrived

743
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,800
Don't worry, take your time

744
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:40,440
Xiao Liu took the table away

745
00:37:57,559 --> 00:37:59,239
Hello Annie

746
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,119

747
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,440

do not know

750
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,920

751
00:38:09,639 --> 00:38:11,639
Ok thank you

752
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,400
President Wang

753
00:38:33,559 --> 00:38:35,199
Chen Yiming, President Chen is looking for you

754
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,719
Where are you now

755
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,280
Hello, Master Wang

You are at home

Sister Ziru, are you okay?

764
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,440
I'm fine. What's wrong

765
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,719
If you don't answer the phone

766
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:13,519
I'm going to call the police

767
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:16,639
Yiming, I'm so sorry

768
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:17,840

Waiting for me

776
00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:31,880
I may not be able to live today

777
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,920
Then I'll make up for you another day

778
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,679
Ok i have no problem

779
00:40:36,679 --> 00:40:37,840
Then let's change the appointment again

780
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,519
OK, that's it first

781
00:40:40,519 --> 00:40:41,159
Goodbye

782
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,639
If you want to find someone to solve

00:41:07,239 --> 00:41:08,000
I'm here

784
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:13,920
President Wang

785
00:42:26,679 --> 00:42:27,559
Just got off work

786
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:28,960
Yes, just got off work

787
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,039
I'm sorry that day

788
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:37,800
No, nothing trivial

789
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,079
Shall I make up for you today?

790
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:46,719
No need Mr. Wang

791
00:42:51,159 --> 00:42:52,239
Didn't you say something is on your mind

792
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:53,559
