1
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,600
[To Dear Myself]

2
00:01:29,975 --> 00:01:31,975
[Ep7]

3
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,120
I believe the police will prove my innocence

4
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,359
You think you can withstand the investigation?

5
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:38,158
If I can't stand the investigation

6
00:01:38,158 --> 00:01:39,595
the whole sales department can't either

7
00:01:39,595 --> 00:01:41,840
You even want to get the sales department implicated?

8
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:44,519
I can tell you, it's impossible

9
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,159
We have only one solution

10
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,040
You should resign

11
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,280
I will never resign because of invoice

12
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,079
Ziting, where's sister Yuan?

13
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:10,839
Went to see the client

14
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:12,039
When will she come back?

15
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,599
I don't know

16
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:44,400
The number you have dialed is busy now

17
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,159
Sorry

18
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,240
Where's president Pan?

19
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,039
He went abroad

20
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:05,159
Ok

21
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:06,439
Ok, I'll call you back

22
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,479
Hello

23
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,960
The number you have dialed is powered off

24
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,759
Sorry

25
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,319
It's powered off

26
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,879
He is on the plane now

27
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,719
Sister

28
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,120
Sister, what's going on?

29
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:12,560
Sister Siyu

30
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,240
Someone wants to find sister Siyu troubles

31
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,800
You should go back now

32
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,800
Sister Siyu

33
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:43,240
Something's wrong?

34
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,199
Yes

35
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,240
What they said is true?

36
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:48,240
What?

37
00:04:48,862 --> 00:04:51,025
The rumor has it that you have 

38
00:04:51,025 --> 00:04:53,000
embezzled several hundred thousand yuan

39
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:54,360
Nonsense

40
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,839
I never embezzle

41
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,680
They have called the police

42
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,725
Police are underway to arrest you

43
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,399
What happened?

44
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,120
Someone did this on purpose

45
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:11,120
Who?

46
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:16,639
Sister Siyu, I believe you won't do such things

47
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:17,319
But...

48
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,519
Will it be ok?

49
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,360
No idea

50
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:23,360
What should we do now?

51
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:37,800
Hurry

52
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:40,680
Excuse me

53
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:51,560
What?

54
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:53,759
You have a problem or miss me?

55
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:57,600
Why are you so silent?

56
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,675
You want me to appreciate your beauty quietly?

57
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,720
Wait for me

58
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,199
I am coming now

59
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,439
What happened?

60
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,800
I need a moment

61
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,360
Doesn't answer the phone?

62
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,399
Chen Yiming doesn't answer my call, either

63
00:07:18,025 --> 00:07:19,680
What's going on?

64
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,199
I do not know

65
00:07:24,025 --> 00:07:28,199
As I know, president Fang and HR department want to fire her

66
00:07:29,025 --> 00:07:30,064
So be it

67
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,879
She should resign

68
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,360
Whether she is fired or resigns,

69
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,839
her career will be ruined

70
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,560
It's hard for her to find a job in the future

71
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,040
Li Siyu is a workaholic

72
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:44,040
It's such a torture for her

73
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:46,439
So I am worried

74
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,399
Siyu, go in from there

75
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,600
Pal, stop

76
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,600
Why do you kill a good guy?

77
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,775
I can't tell who is good or bad

78
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:50,720
Go

79
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:00,080
Water

80
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:01,600
Thank you

81
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,320
Can you tell me what's going on now?

82
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,799
I want to resign

83
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:36,799
What happened?

84
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:41,960
Can you raise me?

85
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:46,639
Of course

86
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:48,679
That's what I am thinking about

87
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,120
I knew you would say so

88
00:09:57,919 --> 00:09:58,919
And I will do so

89
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,900
So can you tell me why now?

90
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,919
It's ok, you have me

91
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:44,639
Hello

92
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,320
President Mao

93
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,639
Hello...

94
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:50,799
Yes... I am Chen Yiming

95
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:57,080
Now?

96
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,480
Ok, no problem

97
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:03,759
Ok, I'll be there right away

98
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,000
Ok...

99
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,960
No problem...

100
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:07,600
Ok

101
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,440
Thank you

102
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:10,559
Goodbye, Mr. Mao

103
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:11,200
Ok

104
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:11,840
Goodbye

105
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:21,840
Siyu

106
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,919
My friend introduced me to a job

107
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:28,075
But the boss wants to see me now

108
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:31,919
You are going?

109
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,720
I need to raise you

110
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,759
So I need to find a job, right?

111
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,519
Can you understand me?

112
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,720
Is Li Siyu with you?

113
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,200
Come, she needs someone to talk now

114
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:31,320
Siyu

115
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,639
Xiaoling is coming now

116
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:35,559
I'm running late

117
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:36,879
I have to go now

118
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:04,840
Li Siyu hasn't changed her mind?

119
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,975
No matter what, we need to fire her

120
00:14:11,975 --> 00:14:14,085
before Pan Zhiyong comes back

121
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,080
Are we too cruel?

122
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,390
Don't worry

123
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,975
Li Siyu can find a new job soon with her ability

124
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:28,875
And she will have a better treatment

125
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,399
I led her for seven years

126
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,039
I really hate to see this

127
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:41,759
You led her for seven years

128
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:43,919
So you must know her well

129
00:14:45,025 --> 00:14:48,759
Will she give the post of director to you?

130
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:52,279
No

131
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:54,825
So with her ability and ambition

132
00:14:54,825 --> 00:14:58,320
will she go easy on you in the end?

133
00:15:03,525 --> 00:15:09,402
The destiny is settled the moment Pan Zhiyong starts the competition

134
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,679
You don't need to feel guilty

135
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,525
After sister Yuan ran the sales department

136
00:15:23,925 --> 00:15:27,375
I could apply for PR fee with her signature

137
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:31,575
to get rid of the troublesome overtime pay application

138
00:15:34,775 --> 00:15:38,399
So sister Yuan did this to you on purpuse?

139
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:43,775
Except her, no one knows my reimbursement of 500 yuan

140
00:15:44,925 --> 00:15:47,525
And she could prove my innocence

141
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,519
But she said she knew nothing

142
00:15:51,525 --> 00:15:55,720
And she is out of touch so far

143
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:56,799
Bitch

144
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:03,519
What if you ask your colleagues for help?

145
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:08,775
If your colleagues can prove the unwritten rule

146
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:13,320
I think you can prove your innocence

147
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,861
Most of the colleagues go to sister Yuan's team

148
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,960
You think they will speak for me?

149
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,960
So sister Yuan is the solution

150
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,639
You need to talk to her

151
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,832
I think she won't be so cold-hearted to you, right?

152
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,925
From Lin Ling's case, I know she is no longer the one she used to be

153
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,399
No compromise

154
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,240
First, don't resign

155
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:52,360
unless they find out the truth and prove your innocence

156
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,039
Second

157
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,120
If Yuan Huizhong does this on purpose,

158
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,080
you should fight against her

159
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:58,879
How?

160
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,840
Discredit her and ruin her

161
00:17:12,358 --> 00:17:13,838
Liu Yang got promoted

162
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:18,160
A chief or a director, I am not sure

163
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:20,119
Anyway, he is promoted

164
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,279
He is so busy every day

165
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,240
Of course I live in Liu Yang's house

166
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,400
His house is big

167
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:31,839
I have a private room

168
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:36,880
Ok, stop it

169
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,559
I am busy

170
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,759
I will call you back later, bye

171
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,640
What the hell

172
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,000
Yuwei, drink some water

173
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,200
Ok

174
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,079
Ask you something

175
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:19,880
Say it, mom

176
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,575
Did your wife drink my medicine?

177
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:26,640
She did, I think

178
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:29,839
She didn't drink at all

179
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:31,799
She hid the medicine in kitchen cabinet

180
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:33,240
I see it all

181
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:40,759
Don't force her to drink it

182
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,440
And we didn't plan to have a second child yet

183
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:46,680
When will you plan to have?

184
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:48,759
Not now

185
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,640
No, Yuwei is in kindergarten

186
00:18:52,775 --> 00:18:55,680
And our country encourages a second child

187
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,713
You should answer the country's call, right?

188
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:02,519
Yes, it's a new policy

189
00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:06,640
But it's based on each family's specific situation 

190
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,279
The specific situation of our family is

191
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:10,720
you need to have a second child as soon as possible

192
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:12,000
Understand?

193
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:14,079
I have a good health now

194
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:18,319
Otherwise I will be too old to take care of your kid

195
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,480
Mom, I'm busy now

196
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,799
We will talk about it another time

197
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:23,799
It's important

198
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,519
Think about it

199
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:26,720
Ok

200
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:29,359
I'll discuss with Zhizhi

201
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,720
No, no need to discuss with her

202
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,039
It's your decision to make

203
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,440
Grandma, I want cookies

204
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:38,640
No

205
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,720
Your mom says, you can't eat too much

206
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,720
I am talking to you, can you hear me?

207
00:19:44,839 --> 00:19:45,880
Yes...

208
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,440
Wait

209
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,839
I'll get you cookies

210
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:57,519
Here

211
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:17,519
Be careful

212
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,400
Have a good rest after you go back

213
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:23,240
Don't think about anything

214
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:24,519
Watch out for steps

215
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:25,519
Yes  -Be careful

216
00:20:26,575 --> 00:20:29,359
You have so many things to do tomorrow

217
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,480
Ok

218
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,440
I asked Chen Yiming to pick you up

219
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,559
Thank you

220
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:45,039
Tell us if you need any help

221
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:45,519
Ok

222
00:20:46,225 --> 00:20:48,160
I have seen all the dramas about harem fight

223
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:49,319
I know all the means

224
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:52,079
Go

225
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:01,079
Be careful

226
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:03,839
Bag

227
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,200
Be careful

228
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:08,599
Be careful

229
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:09,559
Bye

230
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:27,000
Come

231
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:28,759
Drink some hot honey water

232
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,240
Sorry

233
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,559
I can't be with you all day long

234
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,880
Is there any new progress?

235
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,319
I don't want to talk about it anymore

236
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:15,559
How about your work?

237
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,279
You know I am innocent

238
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:02,359
We used this way to get overwork reimbursement for half a year

239
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:05,200
Sister Siyu, I want to help you

240
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:10,000
If I admit it now,

241
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:13,200
I will ask for troubles myself

242
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:14,960
But if you don't help me

243
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,160
they will report you in the future

244
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:19,839
I...

245
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,839
Let me think

246
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:27,279
Li Siyu

247
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:28,640
Please come to finance department

248
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,359
Here you are

249
00:23:54,575 --> 00:23:56,000
Take all the false invoice back

250
00:23:57,125 --> 00:24:01,000
Resubmit an application for overwork payment of the same money

251
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,839
What do you mean?

252
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,359
And in the future, overtime pay is overtime pay

253
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,400
PR fee is PR fee

254
00:24:10,759 --> 00:24:12,119
Don't mix them

255
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,559
What happened?

256
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,000
President Pan came back in advance

257
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:31,319
Come in

258
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:38,720
President Pan

259
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:40,960
I want to explain it to you

260
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:42,440
From beginning to end

261
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:44,200
I never overapply for reimbursement

262
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,039
It's over now

263
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:48,440
I need to explain even if it's over

264
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,000
I do not want to hear it

265
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,359
Why?

266
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:54,240
Because I know you

267
00:24:55,175 --> 00:24:57,319
You won't do things like this for 500 yuan

268
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,680
You are innocent

269
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:03,400
President Pan

270
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,400
Li Siyu

271
00:25:08,075 --> 00:25:10,480
I helped you this time

272
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:15,930
But I can't guarantee I can help you again next time

273
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,425
You know what to do?

274
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,900
The solution is you need to stand tall enough that they can't touch you

275
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,000
President Pan, I understand now

276
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,759
Do not worry

277
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:37,000
I will be a good leader

278
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:39,725
In three months, I will be the director

279
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:41,880
Great

280
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:17,720
Xiao Jia

281
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:18,640
Sister

282
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:19,839
Do you still have that wine?

283
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,599
Yes

284
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,680
I need it

285
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,200
Ok

286
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,680
Sister

287
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:34,440
Pour the wine

288
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:42,000
Since you trust me and follow me

289
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,725
I will never disappoint you

290
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:46,900
Let's work hard together

291
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:49,480
It doesn't matter who is the director in three months

292
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,440
The important thing is we live up to the company and friends

293
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,279
And ourselves

294
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:54,240
Cheers

295
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,119
Cheers

296
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,079
Sister Siyu, we all listen to you

297
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,359
We speak with quality

298
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:03,359
Strength proves everything

299
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,519
We will be better than them

300
00:27:04,519 --> 00:27:05,680
Come on

301
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:07,880
Drink

302
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:13,440
Sister Ziru

303
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,279
3, 2, 1

304
00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:37,519
Another pose

305
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:38,119
Another pose

306
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:38,799
Change the angle

307
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:39,759
Here...

308
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,640
Come, 3, 2, 1

309
00:27:43,825 --> 00:27:45,759
Take a picture of us three girls

310
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:46,359
Ok

311
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:51,720
3, 2, 1

312
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,319
One more

313
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:54,359
One more...

314
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,640
Take more pictures

315
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,200
It's a bit too long

316
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,720
You haven't changed your work for ten years

317
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,480
You lack some experience

318
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,400
I dare not recommend to my clients

319
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,359
Our products are for post-90s

320
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:09,279
They won't want you

321
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:11,425
I think you should need a few more years

322
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,160
You are too old for us

323
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:32,279
Where are you now?

324
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,160
Near your company

325
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:38,279
I'll go to see you

326
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:39,920
I have a good news for you

327
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:41,599
Send me your location

328
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,599
Ok

329
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,425
When are you interested in this circle?

330
00:28:54,825 --> 00:28:56,559
My dad likes it

331
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:58,759
So he forces me to work for this direction

332
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:01,825
So boring

333
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:02,920
I want to go now

334
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,680
Wait a moment

335
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:06,316
My dad made an appointment with a connoisseur for me

336
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,519
Go with me

337
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,119
Ok...

338
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:11,240
Excuse me

339
00:29:16,119 --> 00:29:19,925
The colors and lines have strong visual impact

340
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:28,000
I like the brushstroke 

341
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,839
So I think you like early works of Mondrian

342
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:33,240
Who?

343
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,039
The master of style

344
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,759
Don't tell me

345
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,920
You don't know him?

346
00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:40,160
Of course I know

347
00:29:41,625 --> 00:29:44,975
She has a lot of the works that you are talking about

348
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:48,720
You have a collection of Mondrian's paintings?

349
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,000
Which one?

350
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:51,559
The most famous one

351
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,319
It can't be Red, Yellow and Blue right?

352
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,880
Exactly

353
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,359
That's it

354
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,640
Miss Gu

355
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,799
The biggest dream of my life

356
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:05,450
is to see Mondrian authentic works with my own eyes

357
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:07,559
Can you invite me to your house?

358
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:12,079
We will talk about it another time

359
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,319
I need to see a friend

360
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:15,279
Excuse me

361
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:20,000
Miss Gu

362
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:22,319
Miss Gu

363
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,720
Mondrian

364
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:35,119
Neoplasticism

365
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:39,680
Neoplasticism

366
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:41,680
Mondrian

367
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,039
Neoplasticism

368
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:44,799
Pure abstraction

369
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:47,680
Mondrian. Neoplasticism

370
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,839
Pure abstraction

371
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,480
President Pan came back in advance

372
00:30:53,775 --> 00:30:55,359
He helped me

373
00:30:56,759 --> 00:30:59,613
Finance department tells me to reapply for the reimbursement 

374
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,680
Then it's over

375
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,720
So simple

376
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,160
It's out of thin air

377
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:11,960
It's just back to the original point

378
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,359
Great

379
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:20,592
But sister Yuan and I are completely over

380
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:25,075
Our relationship for seven years comes to an end

381
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:34,799
What a pity

382
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,920
Am I wrong?

383
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:43,759
No

384
00:31:45,425 --> 00:31:49,079
It's so complicated

385
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:56,400
We can't become a sales director unless we experience these?

386
00:31:58,675 --> 00:32:01,759
The workplace is so brutal?

387
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:10,160
I wouldn't lose my job if I had known the answer

388
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:17,319
Well

389
00:32:18,759 --> 00:32:20,119
How about your job?

390
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:31,000
Can we stop talking about this?

391
00:32:37,375 --> 00:32:40,160
Pure abstraction

392
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:28,160
Sorry

393
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:28,799
It's ok

394
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:35,160
Amazing

395
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:40,880
You can understand?

396
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:45,039
Deconstructivism

397
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,839
My friend recommended me to buy it

398
00:33:48,839 --> 00:33:50,519
Do you think it will appreciate?

399
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:54,200
Deconstructionism appreciates every year

400
00:33:55,799 --> 00:33:59,559
But Mbappe and Suarez

401
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,880
are believers of deconstructionism

402
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,079
Of course

403
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:08,250
Ronaldo and Pogba will disagree

404
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,639
Miss Gu, do you think so?

405
00:34:12,518 --> 00:34:13,279
Sorry

406
00:34:14,125 --> 00:34:16,159
Those you mentioned are all artists?

407
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,159
Yes

408
00:34:17,875 --> 00:34:19,800
Why does it sound so familiar?

409
00:34:20,518 --> 00:34:22,439
Excuse me

410
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:31,679
I think, the painting, you can consider about it

411
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:32,360
Really?

412
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,400
Amazing

413
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:35,840
Well

414
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:38,639
Sister Ziru called me

415
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:41,639
She invites us to a new energy lecture on the weekend

416
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:43,360
Let's go together

417
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,400
No

418
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,559
Sister Ziru specially invited you

419
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:52,800
I do not want to go

420
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:55,960
Go...

421
00:34:58,119 --> 00:34:59,719
Anyway, you will idle around

422
00:35:00,525 --> 00:35:03,039
You should go for a walk rather than stay at home

423
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:04,920
Maybe you will have a chance

424
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,900
How do you know I idle around?

425
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,519
I have been to a lot of places today

426
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,960
I mean

427
00:35:26,119 --> 00:35:27,679
Sister Ziru has many friends

428
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:30,850
Maybe she can introduce a job for you

429
00:35:31,425 --> 00:35:32,880
I can solve it by myself

430
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,239
No need her help

431
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:12,875
Your formal competition with sister Yuan will begin

432
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:14,159
Are you sure?

433
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:21,280
I will not lose to her in terms of ability

434
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:23,119
On the team

435
00:36:24,125 --> 00:36:27,440
she almost has all the elites in the sales department

436
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,169
But my team is younger and more courageous

437
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,719
I can poach more outside

438
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:37,000
My only disadvantage is I don't have as many clients as she does

439
00:36:38,775 --> 00:36:41,119
I can find some of my former clients for you

440
00:36:41,525 --> 00:36:43,039
In case you need it

441
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:46,320
No need

442
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,639
What I need is mature sales

443
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:51,800
For the fierce fight

444
00:37:02,675 --> 00:37:06,360
You will be busier than before, right?

445
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,679
I have no choice

446
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,280
Only three months

447
00:37:17,039 --> 00:37:18,159
I can make it

448
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,400
I believe you can

449
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:22,039
But what about your body?

450
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:22,880
Are you sure?

451
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,360
I think it's ok

452
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:28,159
You travel almost each week and work overtime every day

453
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:29,119
And you need to drink with clients

454
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:30,559
Can your stomach stand it?

455
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:36,440
You want to talk about business trip, overwork, drinking

456
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,360
Or stomach?

457
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,631
What I want to say is you don't need to push yourself so hard

458
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,440
But...

459
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,159
But what?

460
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,350
But I have no job now

461
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:50,320
I don't need you to raise me

462
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,800
I can rely on myself

463
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,880
No, don't get me wrong

464
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:13,320
I know you wish me good

465
00:38:16,039 --> 00:38:18,679
I also know you are in a bad mood

466
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,519
Can we stop quarrelling, ok?

467
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,440
You can't be out for too long, right?

468
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,480
You should go back now

469
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,239
How about you?

470
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:13,480
Me?

471
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,320
I will just sit for a while

472
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,320
Bye

473
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:06,159
The exhibition is so boring

474
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:08,039
Where do you want to go tonight?

475
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:14,360
I'll talk to you later

476
00:40:21,239 --> 00:40:21,920
What are you doing?

477
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:31,320
Miss

478
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:34,440
The chair is very long

479
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:36,480
I can sit in the car

480
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,320
Why are you here?

481
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:47,119
I am here all along

482
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,440
I am not talking to you

483
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:51,079
I am talking to my girlfriend

484
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,320
It's your girlfriend?

485
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:53,599
I'm sorry

486
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,719
I need to talk to my girlfriend

487
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:55,559
Talk to you later

488
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:01,639
Are you sick?

489
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:02,760
You are haunting me everywhere

490
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,639
What do you want?

491
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,800
I'm helping you

492
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:05,960
Are we familiar?

493
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:07,480
I don't need your help

494
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:10,760
I can tell you

495
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,920
His name is Xiao Ke

496
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,599
My middle school classmate

497
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,440
I know him so well

498
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:18,599
He is worse than Lanke

499
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,400
Don't believe it?

500
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,960
Look the Moment

501
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:24,840
Look

502
00:41:31,159 --> 00:41:31,960
Look

503
00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:34,975
He is a good classmate

504
00:41:35,711 --> 00:41:38,700
But he is a disaster for women

505
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,239
So dangerous

506
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,960
So you can't judge a man by money

507
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:48,079
Don't go

508
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:48,920
I saved you

509
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:49,639
You should invite me to dinner

510
00:41:49,639 --> 00:41:50,920
Or I invite you

511
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:54,039
Your name is Lei

512
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:55,880
Yes

513
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,519
Listen

514
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,679
Go as far as you can

515
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,360
Why are you so ungrateful?

516
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,639
Your conscience won't hurt?

517
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,119
Gu Xiaoling

518
00:42:05,559 --> 00:42:06,679
Listen

519
00:42:07,039 --> 00:42:08,599
I won't intervene in your business in the future

520
00:42:08,599 --> 00:42:10,599
Otherwise I will be thunderstruck
