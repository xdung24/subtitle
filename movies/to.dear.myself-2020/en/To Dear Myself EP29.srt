# Google translate version for your reference #

2
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,840
Twenty years ago

3
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,200
I leave my work to start a business

4
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,400
Everyone said I was crazy

5
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:44,719
Fourteen years ago

6
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,560
I take out all the money

7
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,599
Invest in Emerald One's research and development

8
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,200
You said I was crazy again

9
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,359
Five years ago, I insisted on the green treasure

10
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:54,959
Must transform and upgrade

11
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:56,319
You guys still say i'm crazy

12
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:58,760
It turns out I'm not crazy

13
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,840
I succeeded

14
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:00,680
Mr. Pan

15
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,400
This previous market

16
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,840
And the current market

17
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,239
It's not the same

18
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:06,920
But courage and vision

19
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,039
In any era

20
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:09,919
right

21
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:10,560
Mr. Pan

22
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,719
That's also out of date

23
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
And cautious

24
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,080
President Wang

25
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:18,680
This is the rule of your financial circle

26
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:19,840
about us

27
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,840
For business people

28
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,240
Only one way

29
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,039
That's going forward

30
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,000
IMHO

31
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,719
Want to make the green treasure bigger

32
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:30,400
There are many ways

33
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:31,479
But you

34
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:32,639
I chose one

35
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:34,560
The dumbest and most adventurous

36
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:36,280
But the most effective

37
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:37,879
Make money in five years

38
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,800
too slow

39
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:42,240
President Wang

40
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,599
If you want to make quick money

41
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:46,319
You shouldn't invest in Emerald

42
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,120
Because of my original intention to create Lubao

43
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,199
Not to make money

44
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:50,479
But to open up history

45
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,159
Ok, deal

46
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,800
Green treasure next step

47
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:55,599
Just rebuild the park

48
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,080
Rebuild the production line

49
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,000
I object

50
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,840
invalid objection

51
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,560
Effective or not effective

52
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:02,840
Let's vote by show of hands

53
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,360
well

54
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,039
Agree to emerald three

55
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,800
Two more production lines

56
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,520
Please raise your hand

57
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,039
Four votes in favor

58
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,080
Fang Zhan

59
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,719
Is it

60
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,240
Do you want to abstain

61
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,000
I vote against

62
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,240
I object

63
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,080
Five votes against

64
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,719
Now that the result is out

65
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:58,120
Then we proceed to the next agenda

66
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,080
Discuss Mr. Wang's proposal

67
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,719
Adjust business layout

68
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:02,759
Create a future concept

69
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,159
First, Mr. Wang

70
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,520
Tell us about the background of the proposal

71
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,319
Ok

72
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,759
Chairman, directors

73
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:13,560
No need to understand

74
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,479
I object

75
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,800
According to the articles of association

76
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,360
Board of Directors

77
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,600
When discussing important matters

78
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,839
Chairman has no decision-making power

79
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:24,519
but

80
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,319
He has a veto

81
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,920
More than ten years

82
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:29,439
I never use

83
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:30,279
This power

84
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:33,480
But today I decided to use

85
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:36,879
And I will use it often in the future

86
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,519
I have seen it today

87
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:50,920
Pan Zhiyong is overbearing

88
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:52,959
This is his style

89
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,879
Not making money for five years

90
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:57,560
But he can tell

91
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,199
Not making money

92
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:01,399
Pan Zhiyong's first purpose

93
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:03,319
But as an investor

94
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,360
Nor my money

95
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,639
It's a strong wind

96
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,720
I still have

97
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,759
How about countless limited partners

98
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:08,879
They treat me

99
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:10,160
There are performance requirements

100
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,519
Does Lvbao really have such a charter?

101
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,319
Have

102
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:29,199
Written at the beginning of the establishment

103
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,120
Just never used it

104
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:32,720
I almost forgot

105
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,800
Can it be changed

106
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,040
Difficult

107
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,639
You have followed Pan Zhiyong

108
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:41,519
More than ten years

109
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:43,279
Do you have any idea

110
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:44,000
Can convince him

111
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,120
Almost impossible

112
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,480
He is very stubborn

113
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:54,480
Things he decides

114
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,800
No one can stop

115
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,360
Coincidence

116
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:01,319
What i want to do

117
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,839
No one can stop

118
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:21,160
what's up

119
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:26,360
Don't see it

120
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,560
What do i ask you

121
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:31,079
I will hand in my homework

122
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,399
Go aside

123
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,959
Count you again

124
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,079
that's it

125
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:52,279
So what

126
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,879
No raise

127
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:55,240
Don't you just think

128
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,720
Looking for a low-paying job?

129
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:58,480
Why are you still asking for a raise?

130
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,759
that

131
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:01,519
The premise of low wages

132
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:02,800
You have to live less

133
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,720
How much work have you sent me recently

134
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:06,879
Yes you promised me

135
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:07,959
Can be late and leave early

136
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:09,000
I left at three in the afternoon

137
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:10,600
But you at eleven o'clock in the night

138
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,720
Give me a voice call on WeChat

139
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,519
Talk about work

140
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,839
Why don't i ask for a raise

141
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,120
Do not worry

142
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:16,639
Wait for the call to go online

143
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:18,680
You deserve a lot of rewards

144
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,759
Speak for words

145
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:21,560
Not leaving yet

146
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:25,120
I think you should

147
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:26,680
Compliment me

148
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,439
You behaved well recently

149
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:39,199
Keep going

150
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,000
Sister Li

151
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:44,040
You cursed recently

152
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,199
Much less than before

153
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,000
Good performance

154
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:48,399
Keep going

155
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,000
That's it for today

156
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,600
Let's end

157
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,839
Chen Yiming, you stay

158
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:27,439
You come with me

159
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:29,399
That don't take it

160
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,000
President Wang

161
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,440
Where are we going now

162
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:20,519
President Wang

163
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,360
You better let me breathe first

164
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:23,840
I'm so prepared

165
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,399
boarding

166
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,840
Sister Ziru is here

167
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,919
How to trim it today

168
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:20,240
It's not me today, it's him

169
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:21,200
Ok

170
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,360
Come on, wash my hair first

171
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,120
Please wait

172
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:24,480
Mr. Wang, I

173
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,120
Go

174
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,840
Hello, please

175
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,039
Go

176
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,240
Wash here

177
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:34,720
beware of the steps

178
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:52,480
Can it be tight?

179
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:53,840
can

180
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,480
How to trim it today

181
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,480
Just look at it, I can do it

182
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,320
Good good good

183
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,000
All right

184
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,519
This is what I want to subvert

185
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,279
The brand strategy of Tianyi Group

186
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,000
Chen Yiming

187
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,919
This is the vice president I value most

188
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:46,440
Miss Gu

189
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:47,440
Thank you

190
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,679
This panji is really good

191
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,639
To be honest

192
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:56,879
There used to be a chef in our family

193
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,320
The dessert made

194
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,080
Really great

195
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,679
I can still eat it now

196
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:03,799
Does he make desserts?

197
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:06,600
If you want to eat, you have to go to France

198
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:08,000
He is a maasai

199
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:09,679
Go back after retirement

200
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,440
I kind of like France

201
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:13,679
I do not like

202
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,519
The overall feeling of Europe now

203
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,720
Behind

204
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,759
If there is no business at home,

205
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,440
I won't go once a year

206
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,639
Where do you like best

207
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:28,720
to be frank

208
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,919
When I went abroad at 18

209
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,720
I am very reluctant

210
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,480
my favorite

211
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,360
Han Tang

212
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,759
That's a brilliant

213
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:47,480
that

214
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:49,320
What year did you go abroad

215
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:51,080
1986

216
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:57,600
That year you were eighteen

217
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,519
I am 51 years old

218
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,360
Is the plan I want available?

219
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,919
No way

220
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:18,919
Before twelve o'clock this evening

221
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:20,159
Must be given to me

222
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,360
Then I will wait for you until two o'clock in the morning

223
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,120
If two o'clock in the morning

224
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,440
You can't deliver yet

225
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,000
I stayed up all night

226
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,399
Drive to your house and beat you up

227
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,480
Take you five minutes

228
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,240
I met someone today

229
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:25,879
He was me for half a year

230
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:27,799
The best condition among people I met

231
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,279
Which group

232
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,919
Across the birth life group

233
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:33,039
Upstart group

234
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,919
We both added WeChat

235
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:37,200
In my experience

236
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,440
After breaking up

237
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,200
I should also chat on WeChat

238
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:41,399
But after breaking up

239
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:42,679
Never show up

240
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:45,440
People don't like you

241
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,440
impossible

242
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,279
At dinner

243
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,679
Have a good chat

244
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,080
If you think it's an opportunity

245
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,519
I won't find you

246
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:53,879
You take the initiative to find someone

247
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:55,720
This

248
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,720
Will it appear to me

249
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,840
Too unreserved

250
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:02,879
From a sales perspective

251
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,600
It's never wrong to take the initiative

252
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:25,200
have you slept

253
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,159
What are you doing

254
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,240
This grandson deleted me

255
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,279
What happened to him

256
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,000
You laugh at me

257
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,799
You still laugh at me

258
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:44,639
People deleted me

259
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,919
You still laugh at me

260
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,879
what's wrong with you

261
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:48,279
I don't like you

262
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:49,240
How could I be so good-looking

263
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,200
He doesn't like me

264
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,559
Miss Gu, hello

265
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,279
Where's your sister Zhou?

266
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,440
Miss Gu, I'm here

267
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:08,600
Sister Zhou

268
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,240
You introduce me to the 57th

269
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,440
Isn't it a marriage trust?

270
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,200
What is this

271
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,720
Do you have any misunderstanding

272
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:16,200
So don't worry

273
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,279
We sit there and talk slowly

274
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:18,440
Go

275
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:19,759
Bring me the tablet

276
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,120
Thank you sister Zhou, we are leaving

277
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,039
I wish you happiness

278
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:23,759
Bye bye

279
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,559
Come

280
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:25,759
Come sit here

281
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:26,559
Sit here sit here

282
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:31,840
let me see

283
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,799
The fifty-seventh you said

284
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:36,879
Is this Mr. Zhao?

285
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:38,759
Yes it's him

286
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:43,799
You guys are dating

287
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:44,679
Yes indeed

288
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,200
When we meet

289
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,279
Still had a good chat

290
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:48,159
But a break up

291
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:49,200
He blacked me

292
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:50,639
You say this behavior

293
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:51,759
What is not a marriage

294
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:53,240
How could it be a marriage care

295
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,519
It's even more unexplainable

296
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:55,559
We both make an appointment

297
00:16:55,559 --> 00:16:57,039
Went to see penguins in Antarctica

298
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:57,919
Two hours later

299
00:16:57,919 --> 00:16:59,200
I can't reach him anyway

300
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:01,759
It's weird

301
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,879
So don't worry

302
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:03,600
I'll ask you

303
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:05,000
There must be a misunderstanding

304
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:07,880
OK, you turn on the hands-free

305
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,000
no problem

306
00:17:22,358 --> 00:17:23,439
Hello i am jerry

307
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,880
Hello, is it Mr. Zhao?

308
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,720
I come from your club

309
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,640
Miss Zhou

310
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,920
Miss Zhou, what is it?

311
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:32,079
Is such that

312
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:32,920
I am here

313
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,440
Want to give you a return visit

314
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,200
Make an appointment with Miss Gu

315
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,039
Do you feel okay

316
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:40,559
quite pretty

317
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,119
We can talk

318
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,880
Then you think you still have

319
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,279
Is it possible to develop

320
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,960
I think it's okay to be friends

321
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,160
If you get married

322
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:51,759
A little older

323
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,319
She is too old for you

324
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,119
I still love

325
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,839
Girls under twenty-five

326
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,680
I still don't think you are old

327
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:04,480
Miss Gu

328
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,440
You let me slow down

329
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:21,559
Miss Gu

330
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,559
You have some tea to cool down

331
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:27,759
You say how old i look

332
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,680
Twenty six up to twenty six

333
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:34,759
such

334
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,400
I still have one

335
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,920
Fifty-eight-year-old professor

336
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,440
Billions of assets

337
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,799
Very good conditions

338
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,079
Like you

339
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:43,279
Around thirty

340
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,839
He should be able

341
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:45,880
I have fallen to

342
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,359
Only old men can see it

343
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:52,720
Miss Gu, you know

344
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,559
Woman's age and worth

345
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:55,599
Is inversely proportional

346
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,799
Man

347
00:18:57,839 --> 00:18:59,559
Age is not too big a problem

348
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:00,279
You just said

349
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:01,640
I look like only twenty-six

350
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:08,599
No matter how well you maintain it

351
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:11,759
Where is the ID number

352
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,160
This one looks good

353
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,000
I want this

354
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:20,359
Send to me send to me

355
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:21,119
Ok ok

356
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:22,319
Send to me send to me

357
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,680
Come pick me up

358
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:44,759
I knew there was a happy event today

359
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,720
You are winning

360
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,759
It's still a new stock

361
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,440
See what you said

362
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:54,200
How vulgar

363
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,119
What's that happy event

364
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:01,920
I'll go first

365
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:02,880
The boss is coming

366
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,960
You cover for me

367
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:06,400
Bye bye you

368
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,440
Don't be afraid

369
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:16,599
I'm here to save you

370
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:21,720
You are too exaggerated

371
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,079
You have a rare foot

372
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:24,559
I must cherish it

373
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:25,400
What did you say

374
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,880
See which one you like

375
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:30,759
Let's apply ice first

376
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:34,200
Give me the foot

377
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,240
slower

378
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:38,960
Why are you twisting so serious

379
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,599
Does it hurt

380
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:40,680
It hurts

381
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,759
Why

382
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:46,160
Bear with me

383
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:51,039
Bear with it, bear with it, bear with it

384
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:38,279
Yu Wei

385
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,200
Mom butterfly

386
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,400
Yuwei, Yuwei, don't move

387
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,000
do not

388
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:53,200
Yu Wei

389
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:55,799
Mom helps you catch butterflies

390
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:56,960
do not move

391
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:12,759
Not later

392
00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:13,519
Catch butterflies like this again

393
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:14,240
do you know

394
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:15,200
Ok

395
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,440
Why did you go

396
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:28,000
I went shopping

397
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,119
How can you take Yuwei

398
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:30,359
Throw it at home alone

399
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:31,319
Windows are not closed

400
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:32,880
Almost something happened just now

401
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,720
Just downstairs supermarket

402
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,640
I was back in five minutes thinking about it

403
00:24:40,759 --> 00:24:42,319
Five minutes will not work

404
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,839
She is so young and active

405
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:45,480
Don't know what is dangerous

406
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:47,240
Can't be distracted for five seconds

407
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,400
There is also a supermarket downstairs

408
00:24:54,839 --> 00:24:55,880
Caibi Farmers Market

409
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,079
50 cents expensive

410
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,519
The price of onion ginger garlic

411
00:24:58,519 --> 00:24:59,720
Nearly twice as expensive

412
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,160
If you can't buy it, don't buy it later

413
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:18,839
Yu Wei

414
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,440
I can't climb higher anymore

415
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,240
do you know

416
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:21,799
Ok

417
00:25:21,799 --> 00:25:23,000
Very dangerous

418
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,160
Pitiful dad

419
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,359
Why do you say that

420
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,200
You scold dad

421
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,559
Dad didn't say a word

422
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,200
Here, shoes on

423
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,599
Go to the room to play

424
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,480
Ok

425
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:15,000
I just spoke a little harder

426
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,839
I have to tell you something

427
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,839
Changsheng Community

428
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:34,599
There is a Fangcao kindergarten

429
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:38,319
I plan to turn Yuwei over

430
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,119
I know that kindergarten

431
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,160
Than Blue Sky Kindergarten

432
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,000
A big difference

433
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:53,160
Hardware facilities are a little bit worse

434
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,000
But the price

435
00:26:55,799 --> 00:26:56,880
More than half cheaper

436
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,240
Zhizhi

437
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:08,640
prior to

438
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:10,640
I am against you taking Yuwei

439
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,799
Send to Jin Gu Duo

440
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,519
Because that is indeed beyond

441
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:16,400
Our class

442
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,720
But now this

443
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,640
Fangcao Kindergarten

444
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,440
Is it too low?

445
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,200
We couldn't reach golden bones before

446
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:33,400
And now

447
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,519
We can't even afford the blue sky

448
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,000
In addition to fragrant grass

449
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:41,559
No other choice

450
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,400
Sorry

451
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,599
it's all my fault

452
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,319
But i still

453
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,000
Worried that Yuwei is gone

454
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,839
Will not get used to

455
00:28:10,359 --> 00:28:11,440
She will get used to it

456
00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:14,960
Zhizhi

457
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,240
Hard for you all this time

458
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,240
The old Chinese doctor didn't let you

459
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,119
Taboo?

460
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:50,880
Don't you instigate

461
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,319
Can you drink less

462
00:28:59,119 --> 00:28:59,759
Drink

463
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,200
Can't you drink less

464
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,680
Pour me up

465
00:29:06,039 --> 00:29:06,759
Drink less

466
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:07,519
Upside down

467
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,519
Upside down

468
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:12,519
Drink you to death

469
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:13,759
Come come drink

470
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,799
Lei Haowen

471
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:21,640
I ask you something

472
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,160
You must answer me honestly today

473
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,440
You let me answer you honestly

474
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,599
It depends on what punishment you use to me

475
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,680
Chili water tiger stool

476
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:33,160
Regardless of the role

477
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,559
If it is a beauty

478
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,160
My superior name recruit

479
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,359
Subordinate names are also recruited

480
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,759
You said

481
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:51,799
How old i look

482
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,200
I'll just say if you don't drink

483
00:29:56,519 --> 00:29:57,240
Say

484
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,079
Say you look like eighteen years old

485
00:30:04,599 --> 00:30:06,240
It seems that I have an attempt to you

486
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:09,839
If you say you are twenty-six years old

487
00:30:10,359 --> 00:30:12,440
It seems I can't eat grapes

488
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,119
Say grapes are sour

489
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,200
So transparent, fair and open

490
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,200
you

491
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:19,960
Twenty-four years old

492
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:23,640
Why am I young and beautiful

493
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,119
But i am now

494
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:26,079
Can't even get married

495
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,640
That might be fate

496
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,400
It's not here yet

497
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,000
When will the fate arrive?

498
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,480
There is another possibility

499
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:36,519
The destined person has arrived

500
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:39,400
Your consciousness didn't feel it

501
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,400
Don't drink

502
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,400
What are you doing

503
00:30:46,759 --> 00:30:47,519
Don't drink

504
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,920
Say you still don't listen

505
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,559
Gu Xiaoling

506
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:55,880
I can't get married anyway

507
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,920
Why are you stealing my wine

508
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:00,039
Gu Xiaoling

509
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,440
You're a little good

510
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:03,920
you do not say

511
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,079
I want to fight for another ten years

512
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:06,200
Where is this?

513
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:12,839
what happened

514
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:14,519
What is this

515
00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:19,480
Don't lie on the table, dirty

516
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,519
Come come

517
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,079
Get up

518
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,359
Fight for another ten years

519
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:35,680
I'll be 40 years old after another ten years

520
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,079
I can't even get married

521
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:40,960
Come

522
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,119
Come

523
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:45,079
Dirty table

524
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,119
Get up and say okay? come

525
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:53,160
You want to marry

526
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,039
Isn't it easy

527
00:31:57,799 --> 00:31:58,440
Do not cry

528
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,400
The one who fell in love with me

529
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,920
I don't like it

530
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:10,000
The person i like

531
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,039
People don't like me

532
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,440
do not Cry

533
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,480
You won't be pretty if you cry

534
00:32:20,359 --> 00:32:21,440
Stop crying, okay

535
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:25,519
you

536
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,920
If you want to cry again

537
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,759
me

538
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,200
I want to take your ugly picture

539
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,079
Make an emoji package

540
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,559
Put it in the circle of friends

541
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:33,200
Take a look

542
00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:35,839
Lei Haowen, dare you

543
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:36,920
Do you see me dare

544
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,079
I shoot

545
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,640
I can't take pictures if you turn around

546
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,160
Come, keep crying

547
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:41,839
I will show you

548
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,920
Various angles

549
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,160
Yes yes this angle

550
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,000
exactly

551
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,920
Cry cry keep crying

552
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:48,400
Unless you promise me not to cry

553
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,359
Come take a selfie, come

554
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,720
You sit down

555
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,519
Then unless you promise me not to cry

556
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,480
You sit down

557
00:32:58,079 --> 00:32:58,720

558
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:00,400
Just don't cry

559
00:33:00,599 --> 00:33:01,839
Let's eat well

560
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:03,880

561
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:06,359
Come, let me pick you up

562
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:10,640
I'm very annoying lately

563
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,200
So annoying

564
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:15,599
I'm really really annoying lately

565
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,680
Is very annoying

566
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:21,599
So annoying

567
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,240
I think

568
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,319
I want to find a boyfriend

569
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:28,720
I want to marry

570
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,720

00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:33,400
Find her a boyfriend

572
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:35,000
Don't let her go crazy

573
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:36,920
Oh my god

574
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,240
Where is my man

Above

579
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,720
OK, no problem

There are dogs

589
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,639
Are you okay, Xiaoling

590
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:09,518
Lei Haowen, come

591
00:34:09,518 --> 00:34:10,598
Come and help me

592
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:11,199
Come and bite me

593
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,000
Come and bite me

594
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,760
Why another one

595
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,519
Withdraw

596
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:16,199
Lei Haowen

597
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:17,719
Lei Haowen

598
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:19,199
You can't save you bastard

599
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:20,840
Come, come, come, hurry up

600
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,840
More than one dog

601
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,880
Come here, let me carry you

602
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:24,039
Lei Haowen

603
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,559
I turn it quickly

604
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:27,679
Run fast

605
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:29,360
Run fast

606
00:34:29,559 --> 00:34:31,280
Go go go go go

607
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,599
how is it going

608
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,280
Have the three dogs chased you?

609
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,920
No, no chase

610
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:47,079
I'm exhausted

611
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:48,679
Tired to death, tired to death, tired to death

612
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,840
Why are you laughing

613
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:16,119
I just suddenly felt

614
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:17,920
Mood improved

615
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:30,840
You said

616
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,960
I want a man

617
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:37,280
It gives me some cherries

618
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,360
what's the meaning

619
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,800
Cherries are good

620
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,760
In China

621
00:35:45,559 --> 00:35:47,239
In traditional culture

622
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,679
Cherry refers to

623
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:51,639
Cherish the person before you

624
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,599
What you said is true

625
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,519
Of course it is true

626
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:06,079
Confucius has said

627
00:36:07,159 --> 00:36:09,519
Cherry refers to

628
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,440
Marry this person

629
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,599
Abbreviated as courtesy, justice and shame

630
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,679
Can't talk nonsense

631
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,480
really

632
00:36:25,239 --> 00:36:26,000
Really

633
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,960
You just have a good foot, keep it for use

634
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,760
Stop noisy

635
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:49,360
Mother Liu Yuwei

636
00:36:49,719 --> 00:36:50,840
The financial notice says

637
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:52,519
Liu Yuwei's living expenses for the next quarter

638
00:36:52,519 --> 00:36:53,199
Haven't paid

639
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,800
Please apply as soon as possible

640
00:36:55,159 --> 00:36:55,800
Don't affect

641
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,199
Liu Yuwei's admission in the next quarter

642
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,440
Manager Hu

643
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,480
Is there any hope for my transfer?

644
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:48,639
Don't go to this kindergarten

645
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:51,239
I want the original kindergarten

646
00:37:51,559 --> 00:37:53,679
Yuwei, obedient

647
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:55,400
This kindergarten is also very good

648
00:37:56,199 --> 00:37:59,119
Mother don't want me

649
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:00,679
I want to wear teacher

650
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:02,639
I want Teacher Liu

651
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:04,559
I want to play with Susan

652
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:06,960
I want to play with Xiaoxiao

653
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,239
I want to play with Brother Haohao

654
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,920
Yuwei, obedient

655
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,639
This kindergarten

656
00:38:15,639 --> 00:38:17,559
There are also many good teachers

657
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,559
And many good kids

658
00:38:19,559 --> 00:38:21,719
I don't want me

659
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,559
Yu Weiguai

660
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,599
Mom will be late if I don't go in

661
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:26,719
I won't go i won't go

662
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,159
Teacher, what do you do

663
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:33,280
The child goes to kindergarten on the first day

664
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,159
It's all like this

665
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:34,880
It depends on your parents

666
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,199
I'm so ruthless

667
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,159
Come

668
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,039
Yuwei, gone

669
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:48,000
Mom, you don't want me

670
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,920
Mother, don't want me

671
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,480
Go in with the teacher, be good

672
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,079
Mother, don't want me

673
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,280
Hello, Mr. Wang

674
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:07,000
Yiming, are you in the company?

675
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:07,840
I'm here

676
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:09,880
I'm in the office

677
00:39:10,039 --> 00:39:11,039
I have something

678
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,079
Only you can help me

679
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,519
OK, I'll go up right now

680
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:16,079
it is good

681
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:16,599
Ok

682
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:25,480
The information here

683
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,679
All very important

684
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:27,719
Let others fix it

685
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:28,920
I really don't worry

686
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:34,559
I will plug in this memory stick

687
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,000
What's the reason

688
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,119
Can't turn on the machine

689
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,400
I just tried

690
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,559
Its memory stick and motherboard

691
00:39:45,559 --> 00:39:46,559
No problem

692
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:47,599
I think it might be

693
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:48,719
System reason

694
00:39:49,239 --> 00:39:50,880
It was fine yesterday

695
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,840
All right

696
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,679
I didn't plug it in

697
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,079
should be

698
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,440
Gosh

699
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,079
All right

700
00:40:16,199 --> 00:40:17,679
Am I stupid?

701
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:21,639
If you are stupid

702
00:40:21,639 --> 00:40:22,119
In this world

703
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:23,519
There are no smart people

704
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,039
Don't tell anyone about this

705
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,679
This is the little secret between us

706
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,000
will not

707
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:32,280
I will never tell anyone

708
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,480
Don't lie to me

709
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:40,280
Obviously sold for 20 million

710
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,159
You let me write a hundred million

711
00:40:41,159 --> 00:40:41,760
this is not

712
00:40:43,559 --> 00:40:45,119
President Fang, President Yuan, go ahead

713
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:45,760
Bye bye

714
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:49,239
Isn't this fake

715
00:40:55,679 --> 00:40:57,039
This is not fake

716
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:59,079
This is called data

717
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,039
Pan Zhiyong will not agree

718
00:41:03,039 --> 00:41:04,000
Did that

719
00:41:04,679 --> 00:41:06,119
This is the decision of Mr. Wang and I

720
00:41:06,679 --> 00:41:07,920
Which President Wang

721
00:41:08,679 --> 00:41:10,280
She is a master in this area

722
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,480
But now the sales are under the control of Pan Zhiyong

723
00:41:13,719 --> 00:41:15,119
He has to read the report every day

724
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:15,760
And also

725
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,039
Call me to the office and ask

726
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,440
In case something is wrong

727
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,639
I can't hide from him

728
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,280
Then we will make two sets

729
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,960
Show him one set

730
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,599
One set for our own use

731
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:31,679
This

732
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,280
This issue

733
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:36,559
I haven't done it

734
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,320
This also matters

735
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,480
Your vital interests

736
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:40,719
Your equity

737
00:41:40,719 --> 00:41:41,679
Will be cashed soon

738
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:43,239
Emerald's valuation goes up

739
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,119
Your net worth will increase

740
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:51,880
Xiaoling said

741
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:53,119
Siyu's company

742
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:54,400
Officially launched next Monday

743
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,440
She always feels a wolf is chasing

744
00:42:03,519 --> 00:42:04,639
Xiaoling also persuaded

745
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:06,159
Let her not fight too hard

746
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:08,079
Of course I can't persuade

747
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,400
Gu Xiaoling recently

748
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,039
Blind date is hit

749
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,119
You say i want

750
00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:17,159
at this time

751
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:18,840
Come in

752
00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:21,880
Lei Haowen

753
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,519
Die if you want to die

754
00:42:24,199 --> 00:42:25,079
I won't stop you

755
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,079
Hurry up and say hello to uncle

756
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:36,719
Yuwei, why are you here?

757
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,159
I miss Uncle Haowen

758
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,119
Zhizhi said she was going out

759
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:42,360
I said, let me take Yuwei

760
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,679
You suddenly said you want to meet

761
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,440
I still want to see you

762
00:42:46,039 --> 00:42:46,679
Our place

763
00:42:46,679 --> 00:42:47,800
Is it not suitable for children

764
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,920
Or let's change the place

765
00:42:49,719 --> 00:42:50,400
It's ok

766
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:51,800
I know the boss here

767
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,000
Yu Wei

768
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:53,880
Uncle, give you some juice

769
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:54,440
good or not

770
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:54,880
Ok

771
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:55,679
sit

772
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,920
Has Yuwei adjusted to the new kindergarten?

773
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,239
Anyway, these two days

774
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:04,599
Stop crying

775
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,840
But obviously can feel

776
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,639
She is very unhappy

777
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,320
How about the new kindergarten

778
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:16,559
Just like that

779
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,480
I was

780
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,239
Should really listen to you

781
00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:26,920
You said that if I am transferred

782
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:28,440
Have a skill

783
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:31,440
I am not now

784
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,599
Make Yuwei suffer such a grievance

785
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,039
You were too unconfident at that time

786
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,360
Think of it now

787
00:43:41,079 --> 00:43:42,199
Actually lazy

788
00:43:44,119 --> 00:43:45,440
I always feel

789
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,079
I just rely on Liu Yang

790
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:49,480
My day

791
00:43:50,039 --> 00:43:51,719
How can I live on

792
00:43:52,679 --> 00:43:53,679
who knows

793
00:43:55,079 --> 00:43:57,400
When Liu Yang is unreliable

794
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,480
This day

795
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,440
There are times when I can't go on

796
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:07,000
No one in this world can trust

797
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:08,880
Only you can trust

798
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,480
How are you and Liu Yang

799
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:24,079
Just like that

800
00:44:27,239 --> 00:44:28,360
Two days ago

801
00:44:30,559 --> 00:44:31,639
He suddenly said something to me

802
00:44:31,639 --> 00:44:32,519
Sorry

803
00:44:33,719 --> 00:44:35,400
Also told me

804
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:37,719
Worked hard

805
00:44:41,199 --> 00:44:42,079
You said

806
00:44:43,559 --> 00:44:45,519
I have been with him for so many years

807
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,599
Never heard of

808
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:48,880
He talks to me like this

809
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:53,880
Instead, I'm getting divorced now

810
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:57,679
He suddenly said this

811
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,079
I really do not know

812
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,320
I should be relieved

813
00:45:05,039 --> 00:45:06,079
Still helpless

814
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:08,920
can only say

815
00:45:10,039 --> 00:45:11,159
People will change

816
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,360
Yes

817
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,039
People must also change

818
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:20,199
People will get old

819
00:45:22,239 --> 00:45:23,800
Why are you still sighing

820
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:25,360
Do not sigh

821
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,639
No time to sigh

822
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,320
I'm trying my best

823
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:30,679
How can there be a better way

824
00:45:30,679 --> 00:45:31,440
Can go to catch

825
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,599
The person i want to catch
