00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:28,975
[To Dear Myself]

2
00:01:30,725 --> 00:01:32,725
[Ep10]

3
00:01:41,975 --> 00:01:45,325
As I know, your dunners came to my house

4
00:01:45,325 --> 00:01:47,175
They messed it up

5
00:01:47,175 --> 00:01:50,000
I will compensate you

6
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:53,040
I just need the rent

7
00:01:53,475 --> 00:01:55,480
I don't want to invite any troubles

8
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,319
Did you hear me?

9
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:57,879
Don't worry, I have solved it

10
00:01:57,879 --> 00:01:59,225
It won't happen again

11
00:01:59,225 --> 00:02:00,040
I do not care

12
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,000
You need to move out by the end of this month

13
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,519
But...

14
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:07,319
Today it's golf range

15
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,840
Next time I will take you to the real golf court

16
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,479
Over there

17
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,199
Over there?

18
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:10,840
Correct

19
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:12,199
Eighteen holes

20
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:12,919
Oh

21
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:16,319
Dear

22
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,639
I want to play more

23
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,080
It's your first time

24
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:22,000
Your skill will go astray if you go on playing

25
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:24,199
Ten dozens are enough

26
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,360
Fine

27
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,960
I will take you here next week if you like

28
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,360
Anyway, I am VIP here

29
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,000
I can come whenever I want

30
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:31,840
Great

31
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:33,240
A cup of coffee

32
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,520
Excuse me

33
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,680
Two cups of coffee

34
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:52,360
I have group purchase coupons

35
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:00,240
You are here to play golf?

36
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:02,120
What's the problem?

37
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:06,875
You got the outfit from the wholesale store in Qipu road, right?

38
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,319
Don't look down on me

39
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:14,200
It's No. 2 retail brand in the world

40
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,120
You rented the pole?

41
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:21,719
I forgot to bring my pole

42
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,360
Borrowed the car today?

43
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,381
I borrow it from my nanny, any problem?

44
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,199
Don't tell her I use the group buying coupon

45
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,479
A rich son needs a group buying coupon?

46
00:03:40,075 --> 00:03:42,159
Thrift is my family's tradition

47
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,919
Two cups of coffee

48
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,719
Let's go to see a movie later

49
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,080
It's boring

50
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,120
Let's go shopping

51
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:57,680
Go shopping

52
00:03:58,639 --> 00:03:59,639
Sucks

53
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:04,199
I like a bag

54
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:06,439
It's not expensive, only over 20,000

55
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,700
You can buy it for me as the anniversary 

56
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,240
that we know each other for a week, ok?

57
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:14,280
It's the latest

58
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,439
It's hard to buy

59
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,700
Excuse me, Mr. Lei, Miss Lai

60
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,700
Can you give me two minutes?

61
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,560
Great

62
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,879
How do you feel today?

63
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:26,680
Very well

64
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,399
What about our service?

65
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,360
Not bad

66
00:04:30,075 --> 00:04:33,399
Do you have any interest in buying a VIP card?

67
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,720
You are not a VIP here?

68
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:39,800
I am

69
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,825
Maybe I haven't come here for a long time, so it's expired

70
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,519
My company didn't renew it?

71
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:48,759
Mr. Lei

72
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,279
Can you tell me your card No.?

73
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:54,231
I can help you renew you now

74
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:02,199
Card No., let me think about it

75
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:05,839
078

76
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,720
I forgot it

77
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,800
I need to ask my secretary

78
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:11,800
You should let me keep the card

79
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,199
So you won't forget it

80
00:05:15,975 --> 00:05:19,125
Miss Lai, actually you apply for a card separately

81
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,775
We have Liren card for female VIPs

82
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:28,000
20% discount after 20% discount after 20% discount

83
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:32,300
And you can enjoy the privilege of a VIP card of 400,000 yuan

84
00:05:32,975 --> 00:05:35,480
What kind of privilege?

85
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,925
You can enjoy all the golf courses

86
00:05:38,925 --> 00:05:41,000
facilities and hotels

87
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,839
You can participate in membership activities for free

88
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:44,959
Great...

89
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:47,399
I'll fill out the form for you right away

90
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:47,959
Ok

91
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,199
We should get one

92
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,160
I like the environment here

93
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,519
And it's close to the downtown

94
00:05:52,775 --> 00:05:54,600
Then we can come here often

95
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,680
How much is it?

96
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,120
It has discount

97
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:01,519
Well, we won't buy the bag today

98
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:02,600
Is that ok?

99
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,719
Mr. Lei, so you will pay with credit card or Wechat or Alipay?

100
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,360
Vivian, leave Mr. Lei alone

101
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,959
He is the senior VIP

102
00:06:14,725 --> 00:06:16,680
He has all our cards

103
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,120
Sorry, Mr. Lei

104
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:22,439
Good day

105
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:23,519
It's ok, thank you

106
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,800
Mr. Lei, sorry

107
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,800
She is new here

108
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,439
She doesn't know you

109
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:37,920
All my fault, I usually keep low profile

110
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,399
I need the Spouse card

111
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,879
Don't give me the Kid card

112
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,439
Let me ask the secretary

113
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:51,480
She is so careless

114
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:53,680
What's wrong with her?

115
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,759
Thank you

116
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,199
We are even now

117
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,439
Do you like that alpaca?

118
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:22,360
I like koala

119
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,360
You like koala

120
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,160
Ok, here you are

121
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,879
Give me the alpaca

122
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:28,839
Alpaca...

123
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:30,000
Alpaca is here

124
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,040
Look at me...

125
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,879
Alpaca

126
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,319
That is camel

127
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,600
I am very happy that you are here

128
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,399
Why do you buy so many things?

129
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,319
You are so polite

130
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,399
Aunt, usually I don't see you

131
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:45,920
I should do this

132
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,199
It costs you a lot of money, right?

133
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:51,639
Aunt can make a lot of money

134
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:52,759
Really?

135
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:57,879
Aunt bought me a lot of toys, clothes and food

136
00:07:57,879 --> 00:07:58,680
Really?

137
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,439
Mom

138
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,680
My cousin can make a lot of money

139
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,279
She can make more money than three of us

140
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:05,399
Really?

141
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,279
It's nothing

142
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:08,040
Aunt

143
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,759
Yuwei is so smart

144
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:11,879
She is promising

145
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,639
What are you talking about?

146
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:17,360
Aunt, no

147
00:08:17,925 --> 00:08:19,920
Now girls are more useful than boys

148
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:21,040
Really?

149
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,639
Look, German Chancellor Merkel

150
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:25,519
Chairman of the International Monetary Fund

151
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:27,279
And Dong Mingzhu, Tu Youyou

152
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:28,120
They are all women

153
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,120
I know nothing of them

154
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,320
Let's talk about my company

155
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:35,360
Most of the managers are women

156
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,960
We lead the men

157
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,600
Really

158
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:42,500
Except the shareholders, most of managers are female

159
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,639
Including sister Siyu

160
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,450
Still, the man leads the women

161
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,799
We have female shareholders

162
00:08:52,175 --> 00:08:57,325
Most of my shareholders and general manager are female

163
00:08:57,975 --> 00:09:00,759
So these women can't manager family well

164
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,600
Auntie, what are you talking about?

165
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,559
It's true

166
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:06,039
I'm telling the truth

167
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,840
What's the point of this?

168
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:12,039
Yeah

169
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,325
Most capable women are single now

170
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,600
I mean in modern society,

171
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,440
We have no distinction between men and women

172
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:24,399
Whoever has the power has the final say

173
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:26,080
The losers will be eliminated

174
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,919
Yes...

175
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,850
So, aunt, don't force them to have a son

176
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,639
Cultivate Yuwei well

177
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,720
She is no worse than a boy

178
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,720
I am no worse than a boy

179
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,759
Ok...

180
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,559
Mom, time to eat now

181
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,720
Ok, eat

182
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,080
Come. Let's eat

183
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,360
Come, put on your shoes

184
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,600
Hello

185
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:17,679
Are you off work?

186
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,679
Can I invite you to dinner?

187
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,759
No need

188
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:26,159
I don't mean anything else

189
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:28,840
I just want to show my gratitude

190
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:33,840
Ok, name the place

191
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,320
I will send you the place later

192
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,399
You freaked me out

193
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:22,639
Come, Xiaoling

194
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,639
You just invite me to eat this?

195
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,639
I saved you over 40,000 yuan

196
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:34,600
Don't underestimate the shop

197
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,039
They only sell fifty pots a day

198
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:39,559
The boss is my friend

199
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:41,279
Otherwise you need to wait for 3 days

200
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,159
Sit...

201
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:44,440
My clothes so expensive

202
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,480
You just let me sit here?

203
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,440
Gosh

204
00:11:47,025 --> 00:11:48,960
Not a big deal, look

205
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:50,840
Aston Martin

206
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:52,440
Ferrari

207
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,320
And McLaren

208
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,759
Don't worry, you are not the only one

209
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,720
Sit down

210
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:58,879
Be careful

211
00:11:58,879 --> 00:11:59,679
You should eat

212
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:00,639
Come, eat

213
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,559
Come...

214
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:02,879
You are back

215
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:04,320
Brother Yang 

216
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,240
Siyu, you are here

217
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,879
I will reheat the dishes for you

218
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:07,600
No...

219
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,960
Leave it to me

220
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:10,240
Sit down

221
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,799
I am here to see aunt

222
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,200
Brother Yang, you just get off work?

223
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,240
Why do you work harder than me?

224
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,159
After he becomes the leader of tender team

225
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:23,399
he works overtime every day

226
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:25,480
He is back a little early today

227
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,039
Brother Yang got promoted

228
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,279
Congratulations

229
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:31,000
Just a team leader 

230
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,039
Just a team leader

231
00:12:33,325 --> 00:12:35,679
But the project is more than 20 million yuan

232
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:36,759
What project?

233
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,519
Lighting engineering renovation in the suburbs

234
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:44,440
So can My Lubao have a chance?

235
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,279
Yes

236
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,225
This time, we need to change the old batteries 

237
00:12:50,225 --> 00:12:51,925
to environmentally friendly batteries

238
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,519
Then I'll bid on behalf of Lubao

239
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,519
No problem

240
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:57,875
I will tell you when we have the tender plan

241
00:12:58,159 --> 00:12:58,879
Thank you, brother Yang

242
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,800
During the bidding process, we need your help

243
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,559
To be honest

244
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:05,080
I am the team leader

245
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,000
But I don't have a say who will have the bid in the end

246
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,440
You need to speak with your products

247
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,879
Don't worry

248
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,799
Lubao has the reputation in the industry

249
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,240
The quality is great

250
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:18,125
I won't give you any special help because we are friends

251
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,480
I know

252
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:21,399
Don't worry, I won't make troubles for you

253
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:22,480
We do things according to the rules

254
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:26,960
You just need to tell me your team's decision in advance

255
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,559
So I could be better prepared

256
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,475
As long as I don't violate the principles 

257
00:13:31,475 --> 00:13:33,200
or don't be caught for playing favouritism 

258
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:35,399
and committing irregularities, I will help you

259
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,840
Thank you, brother Yang

260
00:13:37,675 --> 00:13:39,919
Or if you come for the tender,

261
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:43,800
don't tell your company your relationship with us

262
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:45,960
I won't

263
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,559
My colleagues won't know our relationship

264
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:51,050
And no one knows except me and Zhizhi

265
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:08,159
So delicious

266
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,080
You are such a foodie

267
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,060
I, Lei Haowen, am the gourmand of Huangpu

268
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:16,519
I will take you to eat more delicious food in the future

269
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,799
Just eat 

270
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:20,679
Xiaoling, thank you today

271
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:23,919
You didn't expose me and you even cooperated with me 

272
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:25,519
Great

273
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:26,679
Thank you too

274
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,240
Help me leave a bastard

275
00:14:29,475 --> 00:14:33,799
Now we eat together

276
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:36,399
So we are good, right?

277
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,320
Let me have a reintroduction

278
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,080
My name is Lei Haowen

279
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,399
Nice to meet you

280
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,960
Eat

281
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:48,399
Eat, come

282
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,440
Where is your girlfriend?

283
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,799
Why you didn't ask her here?

284
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:54,799
She is my ex-girlfriend

285
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,519
When?

286
00:14:57,679 --> 00:14:58,960
Three hours later

287
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:01,879
She is pretty

288
00:15:03,175 --> 00:15:05,080
But she is a little vulgar

289
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:07,000
Why say so?

290
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,480
We just meet for the second time

291
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:11,399
She told me to buy her a card and a bag

292
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:13,279
Don't you think she is vulgar?

293
00:15:14,825 --> 00:15:17,039
Spend some money for her, what's wrong?

294
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:18,834
If you don't spend money for her, 

295
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,559
why should she be your girlfriend?

296
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,840
Only incapable men will think women are vulgar

297
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:27,159
Yes... You are right

298
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,240
It's not vulgar

299
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,799
What is it called?

300
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,840
I overestimate myself

301
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,120
If you are my girlfriend

302
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,975
I will buy everything for you even if I am bankrupt 

303
00:15:42,725 --> 00:15:44,759
Stop it, I am not your girlfriend

304
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:46,519
I say, if

305
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:47,879
No if

306
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,200
No if...

307
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,480
Xiaoling

308
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:56,320
You should smile often

309
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,399
Don't pull the long face all day

310
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,525
Because you look at least ten years younger when you smile

311
00:16:03,225 --> 00:16:05,720
You will look like at most forty

312
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:06,960
Lei Haowen

313
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,559
Are you on purpose?

314
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:09,720
No, I don't eat coriander

315
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:11,559
I eat green onion

316
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:14,480
No

317
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:16,679
You smash for real?

318
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,120
You are laughing, so great

319
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:22,440
Come

320
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,000
I eat too much

321
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,679
I went to the gym last month

322
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:34,720
Now it's all ruined

323
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:35,679
It's ok

324
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:37,720
I don't mind it even if you put on five or six catties

325
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:39,840
You take advantage of me again

326
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,799
I will teach you a lesson

327
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,159
I am sorry...

328
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:43,240
That's it

329
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:45,159
I will walk back with you

330
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:45,919
As exercise

331
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:48,375
I won't drive you back as apology

332
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,720
Your car?

333
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,879
You won't be ashamed when you drive me home?

334
00:16:55,559 --> 00:16:56,720
I am a confident man

335
00:16:59,159 --> 00:16:59,879
Come, goddess

336
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:00,840
Let me help you with your bag

337
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,640
What are you doing?

338
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:00,400
Will people think we are a happy young couple?

339
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,759
Lei Haowen

340
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,799
You are so brazen-faced

341
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,920
It shows I am a man of taste

342
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,240
I have told you

343
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,160
We can't be together

344
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,359
But I want to try

345
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,640
You really spend money to no avail 

346
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:16,160
What if it's to some avail?

347
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:18,880
You are so brazen-faced

348
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:21,960
I will do everything I can for you

349
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,480
Lei Haowen

350
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:27,359
If you really want to be my boyfriend,

351
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,359
let's take a stroll around IFC

352
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:35,279
If you want to be my ordinary friend

353
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:36,960
we can take a stroll along the Huangpu River

354
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,119
IFC

355
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,640
Forget it

356
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:49,039
IFC, right?

357
00:19:49,425 --> 00:19:51,599
You'd better invite me to the little restaurant with your little money

358
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,480
I want to die

359
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,440
Can you let me die?

360
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,240
I can't

361
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:57,759
Consider me, ok?

362
00:19:57,759 --> 00:19:58,519
Eyes on road

363
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:07,839
9996

364
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:09,039
9997

365
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,119
9998

366
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:11,200
9999

367
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:12,240
10,000

368
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,200
Stop counting

369
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,519
Legs so short

370
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:16,720
You have never seen long ones

371
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,559
Ok, I am home

372
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:20,279
It's ok

373
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:21,559
Let me walk you to your door

374
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:22,319
No need

375
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,359
Ok

376
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,160
Thanks

377
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,125
If you really want to thank me, stop blacklisting me

378
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:41,599
Let me help you

379
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:46,599
What happened?

380
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:52,375
Do you have friends who rent a house?

381
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:54,920
Yeah, you ask the wrong person

382
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:57,759
One of my friends have so many houses to rent

383
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,039
Bragging again

384
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,039
No, I am not

385
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:01,400
Say it, what requirements?

386
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:04,559
It's not too far from my company

387
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:06,400
It needs to be convenient for transportation

388
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,640
I should be near the subway

389
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,559
The environment should be quiet in a bustling area

390
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,039
It's comfortable to live

391
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:13,880
And don't be too expensive

392
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,480
Ok?

393
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:16,640
Ok

394
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:18,079
That's all?

395
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:19,359
Count on me

396
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,279
Thank you

397
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:22,759
It's ok

398
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:25,640
Don't see me an outsider

399
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:31,279
Ok, I won't see you an outsider

400
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:35,250
From today on, you are my good buddy

401
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,000
You are my BFF

402
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,839
Bye

403
00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:41,319
Go to bed early

404
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:01,200
Hello

405
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:03,960
Let's break up

406
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,440
Why?

407
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:09,775
I walked alongside Huangpu River just now

408
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:12,279
Don't understand?

409
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,050
If you don't understand, it means we are not good for each other

410
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:24,519
One

411
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,559
Two

412
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:26,119
Three

413
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:26,960
Four

414
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:27,839
Five

415
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:28,759
Six

416
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:29,359
Seven

417
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:29,880
Eight

418
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:30,720
Nine

419
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:31,359
Ten

420
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:31,920
Eleven

421
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:39,160
Zhizhi

422
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:41,440
Take the medicine

423
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:48,200
Mom, sister Siyu have told you a lot today

424
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:49,960
What did she say?

425
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:53,720
You don't remember?

426
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:56,279
Why should I listen to her?

427
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,920
You say, she is quite capable, right?

428
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,880
How old is she?

429
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:01,319
32

430
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:04,799
Yellow face and deficiency of qi and blood

431
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:07,880
Yeah, she works very hard

432
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,640
She is capable and can make a lot of money

433
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,759
What's the use?

434
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:14,680
She is 32, but still single

435
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,000
She doesn't have a family

436
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,160
She is going to get married

437
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:21,359
After getting married, she needs to have a baby

438
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:23,319
Till then she will be 34 or 35 at least

439
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:25,480
Let me tell you

440
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:28,960
Women should have a baby before 30

441
00:23:29,275 --> 00:23:32,680
Otherwise it's not good for mom and baby

442
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:35,119
Today Siyu's persuasion is futile

443
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:36,799
Zhizhi

444
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,640
The women's capability is fake

445
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,759
Men's capability is true

446
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:44,559
Zhizhi, hurry

447
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:45,400
Stop it

448
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,480
Drink the medicine

449
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:48,839
Give me a good grandson

450
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,000
Drink it...

451
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:51,599
Drink it...

452
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:53,319
Drink

453
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,240
Mom, let me tell you the truth

454
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,400
It's not true that we don't want a son

455
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,440
We just can't afford another kid

456
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:05,759
What does it mean?

457
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:07,880
To be honest

458
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,200
Our salary is so hard to support Yuwei

459
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,519
We really can't afford a second child

460
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:18,920
Liu Yang has been promoted

461
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:21,500
Now he is the director or the team leader?

462
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,400
Mom, let me tell you this

463
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:27,680
Liu Yang's salary is 15,000

464
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:29,720
Mine is 6,000 at most

465
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:32,200
21,000 in total

466
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,079
House loan, 6000 one month

467
00:24:35,319 --> 00:24:36,920
3000 for meals each month

468
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,920
Maintaining a car, 1,500

469
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,160
Yuwei's early education class plus kindergarten

470
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,759
It's 8000

471
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Utility fee, 250

472
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,160
Phone fee and internet fee 150

473
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,160
My bus fare is 100

474
00:24:49,225 --> 00:24:51,599
In total, it's 19,000

475
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,000
So expensive?

476
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,200
Liu Yang, a big man

477
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,440
He needs to buy some clothes

478
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,400
Yuwei needs toys from time to time

479
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:09,275
We need to go shopping during the weekends

480
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,960
All need money

481
00:25:12,075 --> 00:25:15,519
We really can't afford another one

482
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,640
I see

483
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:33,160
How could this be?

484
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:51,559
Wake up...

485
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:55,400
I want to discuss something with you

486
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:56,759
Mom, ok

487
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,839
I thought about it all night last night

488
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:01,319
I had a good idea

489
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,599
I will take Yuwei back to hometown

490
00:27:05,875 --> 00:27:08,359
Why do you take her back for nothing?

491
00:27:10,175 --> 00:27:12,960
Yuwei needs to spend at least 8000 yuan each month

492
00:27:13,125 --> 00:27:15,759
You will save 8000 yuan after I take her back, right?

493
00:27:16,075 --> 00:27:18,519
It's enough to support a son

494
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,400
Mom, what do you mean?

495
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,920
Zhizhi told me

496
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:27,200
Yuwei spends over half of your salary at least a month

497
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:28,599
You have no money

498
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:30,319
So you can't have a second child

499
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:34,799
So this is the only thing I can do for you

500
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,680
What nonsense are you talking to mom?

501
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,160
No

502
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,119
Zhizhi

503
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,960
Zhizhi... Don't worry

504
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,759
Just leave Yuwei to me

505
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:45,319
I will be good to her

506
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,650
I will take her to early education class or interest class

507
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:52,800
The education in hometown is no better that in Shanghai

508
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:54,359
But it's cheap

509
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,175
120 yuan each month

510
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,079
Mom

511
00:27:58,759 --> 00:27:59,880
You can go

512
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,039
But Yuwei must stay

513
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,325
She must receive education in Shanghai

514
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,559
When will you have a second child?

515
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:16,119
I can tell you

516
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:20,075
If you don't have a second child, I won't leave

517
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:21,599
I will live here forever

518
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:37,824
Your mom is determined this time

519
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:39,880
What should we do?

520
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:42,440
Don't ask me

521
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:44,279
You called her to come here

522
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,240
Figure a way out yourself

523
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:56,119
Brother

524
00:28:57,119 --> 00:28:57,920
You are so early

525
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:01,359
According to your instructions

526
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:05,500
I told them you told me to draft up a tender contract

527
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:08,599
Then I asked them some questions

528
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,839
This is their reply

529
00:29:23,079 --> 00:29:23,839
Xiao Xu is great

530
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,799
Very professional

531
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:30,240
Yang Feng is a little inexperienced

532
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:37,119
Zhang Xinyi is not bad too

533
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,400
Xiao Zhao

534
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,525
According to what he said, it's doomed

535
00:29:51,319 --> 00:29:52,480
Really?

536
00:29:53,079 --> 00:29:53,759
Here

537
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:56,279
Here

538
00:29:58,039 --> 00:29:59,359
It's nothing on the surface

539
00:29:59,725 --> 00:30:02,000
It's fatal if something goes wrong

540
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:05,200
So he is the mole

541
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:09,350
We will know the truth after I compare the data

542
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,200
Put it here first

543
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:38,160
Hello, Yiming

544
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,279
Where are you now?

545
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:41,200
I am busy today

546
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,000
I can't go

547
00:30:42,275 --> 00:30:44,200
What's more important than playing basketball?

548
00:30:44,725 --> 00:30:46,960
It's more important than basketball

549
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,279
That's all

550
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,160
Brother, do you need to rent a house?

551
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,400
Exactly

552
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:57,550
I rent a house for my future girlfriend

553
00:30:57,799 --> 00:30:59,039
Brother, come inside

554
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,160
Come in

555
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,440
Do you have...

556
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,475
Hello, Liu Yang

557
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:14,319
Yiming, sorry

558
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:15,319
I am working now

559
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,200
When will you come?

560
00:31:18,039 --> 00:31:19,559
You just play with Haowen first

561
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:20,720
I will go after work

562
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:21,599
Ok

563
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,640
My two brothers stood me up

564
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:01,119
What a coincidence

565
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,960
My client stood me up

566
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:08,000
I will go to see you

567
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,240
Ok

568
00:32:10,175 --> 00:32:15,350
You want to watch a movie or play video games

569
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,960
Or something else?

570
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
We will discuss about it later

571
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:23,279
Ok, see you in the old place

572
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:24,839
Sister Siyu

573
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,400
What?

574
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,825
This morning Liu Yang's mom told us

575
00:32:28,925 --> 00:32:31,920
she won't go if we don't have a second child

576
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,759
What should I do?

577
00:32:34,625 --> 00:32:36,880
I think aunt is too idle

578
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:41,550
You think find her a husband

579
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:43,480
Then she will have no time for you

580
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:45,519
I am serious

581
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,519
I am serious too

582
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:49,240
Give me another idea

583
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,759
President Pan

584
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,279
Hello, president Pan

585
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:20,839
I'm sorry

586
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:21,799
Mr. Lei

587
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,000
What a traffic jam

588
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:25,599
It's ok

589
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,839
A bit old

590
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,920
This is the style here

591
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:33,799
Your house is so old

592
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,319
Subway is around here, will we be often stuck in traffic jam?

593
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:39,440
No

594
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:44,400
Here is the bathroom

595
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,599
And kitchen

596
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,850
It's hard to find a one-room house nearby

597
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,280
The decoration is also very stylish

598
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,599
Ok

599
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:20,400
Ok

600
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,400
Mr. Lei, how's it?

601
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,079
It's ok

602
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:42,920
My future girlfriend may like the style

603
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:44,280
So you will sign the contract?

604
00:34:44,518 --> 00:34:45,759
Wait

605
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:48,000
How much

606
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:49,000
4,000 a month

607
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:50,079
One month deposit and 2 months up front

608
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,880
4,000 a month?

609
00:34:52,125 --> 00:34:54,920
You think I am an idiot?

610
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:57,039
I just live next to you

611
00:34:57,325 --> 00:34:59,400
I know the price better than you

612
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,119
Brother, since you live nearby

613
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:02,199
you should know better

614
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:04,559
This is the price here

615
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,000
3,000 a month

616
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:07,400
3,000

617
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:10,920
3,000, you will have this kind of decoration?

618
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,320
You will have this furniture and appliances?

619
00:35:12,475 --> 00:35:15,000
Enough, what decoration, furniture and appliances

620
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,800
What do you have here?

621
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,159
I still have to buy more

622
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:18,320
Let's make a compromise

623
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:19,280
3,500

624
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,550
Brother, the price can't be less

625
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,159
Let me tell you, you can't do business like this

626
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,400
I rent so sincerely

627
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,375
We both should make some compromise

628
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:34,400
3,999

629
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,920
What the hell

630
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,000
Brother, you want to a cheap one

631
00:35:39,325 --> 00:35:41,719
I can show you a cheap one

632
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,079
Ok...

633
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:49,239
Let me tell you

634
00:35:50,675 --> 00:35:53,119
My girlfriend is so beautiful

635
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,425
Here is only 300 meters away from my home

636
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,880
Otherwise I won't buy it

637
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,480
Fine

638
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:00,079
Brother

639
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:01,280
We should sign the contract

640
00:36:02,519 --> 00:36:03,280
Wait

641
00:36:03,925 --> 00:36:06,159
I can give you 3,999 yuan

642
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:07,800
But I have one condition

643
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:08,800
Ok

644
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:10,900
My girlfriend will sign the contract

645
00:36:11,025 --> 00:36:12,599
She will bargain with you

646
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,239
You should give her the price she wants

647
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:17,400
I will make up for the rest

648
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:18,320
A deal

649
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,159
Check the contract

650
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:30,800
Just fabricate a agenesia certification online

651
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,679
But...

652
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,050
Where do I get one?

653
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,450
Just search one online

654
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,679
Yes

655
00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:45,960
Thank you, Xiaoling

656
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,039
You're welcome

657
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,239
Ok

658
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,679
Bye

659
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,760
Doudou should quit

660
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,599
It's ok...

661
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,119
Thank you

662
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:09,000
Are you Yuwei's mother?

663
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,199
Yes, you are...

664
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:12,480
I'm Doudou's mother

665
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:13,599
Hello

666
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,840
I'm here to apologize to you

667
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:22,360
I and my husband are so busy recently

668
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,440
We have no time to take care of Doudou

669
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:29,679
As I know, Doudou bullies others in kindergarten

670
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,159
I am so sorry

671
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:35,639
It's ok...

672
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:38,159
Doudou has a little ADHD

673
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:40,440
But just a little

674
00:37:40,679 --> 00:37:42,079
He doesn't need to take medicine

675
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:44,225
His ADHD will be eradicated

676
00:37:44,275 --> 00:37:46,889
as long as we pay attention to code of conduct

677
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,920
So don't worry

678
00:37:48,225 --> 00:37:50,875
Doudou won't hurt your kid

679
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,039
Great

680
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,400
I plan to quit my job

681
00:37:54,525 --> 00:37:56,960
I will take care of Doudou in person

682
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,599
So rest assured

683
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,050
Doudou, he will change

684
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:03,679
I mean it

685
00:38:06,975 --> 00:38:12,175
Well, as I know, many parents don't like Doudou

686
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:17,280
They even write a letter to dismiss Doudou

687
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,079
It's...

688
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:23,000
Actually...

689
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,159
Yuwei's mom

690
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,650
Can you give Doudou another chance?

691
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,840
Forgive Doudou

692
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:32,679
Doudou loves this kindergarten

693
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:35,550
He also likes playing with others

694
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:41,025
We promise he will change

695
00:38:42,679 --> 00:38:47,325
I think it's normal that young boys are naughty

696
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,480
Thank you so much, Yuwei's mother

697
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,480
I...

698
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:53,000
Don't worry

699
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:57,725
If they mention this again, I will help you explain

700
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,920
Thank you

701
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,440
Well, I won't interrupt you now

702
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:07,079
I need to apologize to other parents now

703
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:08,800
Ok, don't worry

704
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,079
Excuse me

705
00:39:17,159 --> 00:39:18,599
You are Xiaoyu's mother, right?

706
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:19,320
Exactly

707
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,280
I am Doudou's mother

708
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:23,599
I am here to apologize to you

709
00:39:24,039 --> 00:39:25,360
My son recently...

710
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:43,079
Yiming, sorry

711
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,250
President Pan wants to see sister Ziru today

712
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,039
I am the introducer

713
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,639
I need to go with him

714
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,519
What will you do?

715
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,639
Can I ask?

716
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,559
President Wang

717
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:18,400
Which university do you graduate from?

718
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:19,239
Harvard

719
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,280
My major is finance

720
00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:30,440
Think about when I started my business...

721
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:41,719
Everyone knows

722
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:44,840
The battery industry is currently facing a cold winter

723
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,375
President Wang, you want to join in now

724
00:40:48,475 --> 00:40:50,360
You are so remarkably brave

725
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,000
Actually, I have no courage at all

726
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:53,880
I'm very timid

727
00:40:54,775 --> 00:40:57,600
But I knew a sentence when I was young

728
00:40:58,675 --> 00:41:01,880
If winter comes, can spring be far behind?

729
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:05,920
But...

730
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:08,840
Spring will come

731
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:12,175
But not everyone can live to that time

732
00:41:17,175 --> 00:41:21,000
So who can survive this winter?

733
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:24,280
Those who have grain stock at home

734
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:26,079
What about those who have a shotgun?

735
00:41:27,625 --> 00:41:30,280
You mean Lubao III ready to be on the market?

736
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:30,920
Correct

737
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,875
A shotgun can only guarantee food and clothing

738
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:37,679
Those who have grain stock and shotguns

739
00:41:37,775 --> 00:41:39,880
will become the king of this industry

740
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:43,880
I agree

741
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:46,480
Come

742
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:03,639
So how much grain stock do you have?

743
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,775
It depends on the size of your warehouse 

744
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:11,360
Great

745
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,599
Well, Mr. Pan

746
00:42:15,725 --> 00:42:19,975
As I know, you have some flaws in series A financing

747
00:42:20,325 --> 00:42:23,719
So you are bound hands and feet in Lubao

748
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,679
You know quite a lot

749
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:28,600
I think you need an ally

750
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:30,000
I don't need an ally

751
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:30,880
But a comrade in arms

752
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:33,679
Mr. Pan

753
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,000
This is the purpose I am here today

754
00:42:37,519 --> 00:42:40,575
I have the strength and sincerity as well

755
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:46,559
Ok

756
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:51,425
For your sincerity, I will tell you a secret

757
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,880
You are not the only one who believes

758
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,119
spring will come sooner or later

759
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,800
or believes that the winner is king

760
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,320
Who else?

761
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:02,679
As I know, at least two more companies

762
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:05,360
I have competitors

763
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,039
I hope it's you in the end

764
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,519
