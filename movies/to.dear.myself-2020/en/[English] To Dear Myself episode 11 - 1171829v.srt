00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,700
[Episode 11]

4
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,200
I‘ve finished the letter.

5
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,600
It's in both Chinese and English with one topic.

6
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,800
In order to provide a happy environment for kids to grow up in,

7
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,000
the school must persuade Doudou to quit.

8
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,300
- Have you gone back home? 
 - Socializing with the other parents

9
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,300
What's up?

10
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,800
Go on then.

11
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,400
Senior Brother.

12
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,180
You haven't left?

13
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,000
The newest development of three districts.

14
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,450
That quick?

15
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:41,400
Mr. Liu, you can give another two districts to me.

16
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,280
You've worked hard.

17
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,300
It's okay.

18
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,200
Is Xiao Zhao the "nail"?

19
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,800
I cross-examined several numbers and

20
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,500
I found that all the mistakes are in Xiao Zhao's part.

21
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,600
So I can conclude that he is the "nail."

22
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,010
Mr. Liu, what should we do next?

23
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,260
I will think it over.

24
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,600
Go home. I also need to leave.

25
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,200
Okay.

26
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,900
Doudou's mom apologized to me.

27
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,800
She said she decided to quit her job and stay at home to educate him.

28
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,000
She said that Doudou will definitely change for the better.

29
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,600
So shall we postpone handing in the letter?

30
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,200
No way.

31
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,600
I have already tolerated as much as I could.

32
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,400
This is not the first time that Doudou's parents apologized.

33
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,800
But does he change? We don't need to bother with them.

34
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,000
- That's right. 
 - But Doudou's mom is very sincere.

35
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,400
It doesn't matter.

36
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,600
I just feel if we force them to quit,

37
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,100
will it affect the boy psychologically?

38
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,200
You are so muddled.

39
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,600
You are able to think of the psychological impact on Doudou.

40
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,370
He is a little bully.

41
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:31,200
He a bully every day in school.

42
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,400
You have to think of the

43
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,200
psychological impact he has made on our kids.

44
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,000
I asked Yuwei.

45
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,800
Doudou is a bit naughty and he likes to tease others,

46
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,600
but he cannot be considered a bully.

47
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,600
Yes. Yes. My Linda told me as well.

48
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,300
She said that there are some good points to Doudou.

49
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,800
He would voluntarily help the teacher.

50
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,400
My William said that

51
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,000
he walks back and forth during classtime.

52
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,200
He distracts other kids from studying.

53
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,400
Yes. There is another time.

54
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,600
He blocked the toilet entrance, stopping other kids from going to the toilet.

55
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,200
Xingxing pissed his pants in the end.

56
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,800
You know what he did yesterday? He was even worse yesterday.

57
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,800
Doudou put an insect on Miao Miao's dress.

58
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,000
He scared Miao Miao so much that she cried.

59
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,600
That's right.

60
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,800
This is probably just mischief between kids.

61
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,800
If what our kids attend is a low-end kindergarten with the tuition of ¥1,000 per month,

62
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,400
then whatever happens is fine.

63
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,800
But we have spent so much money

64
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,400
to attend such a good kindergarten, what do we expect from it?

65
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,700
We just want our kids

66
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,100
to grow up peacefully and healthily, right?

67
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,400
Right. We can't tolerate any mistake in education.

68
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,200
Yes. Yes.

69
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,200
Yuwei's mom, if you want to be a good person,

70
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,600
we won't force you to do anything.

71
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,600
Anyway, I must make Doudou leave

72
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,700
in order to have a peaceful and healthy environment for my Miao Miao to grow up in.

73
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,500
I will sign first.

74
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,200
Yuwei's mom,

75
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,000
are you going to sign it...

76
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,200
or not?

77
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,600
Sign it.

78
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,600
All right.

79
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:30,800
Miao Miao will celebrate her birthday on the 20th.

80
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,200
We are preparing a big birthday party for her at the saddle club.

81
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,000
- Join us on that day. 
 - Sure.

82
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
William likes riding a horse the most.

83
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Have William teach my Linda.

84
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,300
Sure.

85
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,800
Miaomiao really wants Yuwei to join.

86
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,700
Yuwei's mom, on that day, your little Yuwei,

87
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,000
will have time, won't she?

88
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Yes, she is available.

89
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,900
Eat the cake. It's pretty delicious.

90
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,400
Yiming!

91
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,400
You finally came.

92
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,300
I just finished working.

93
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,280
I will get changed first.

94
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:37,510
- President Wang. 
 - See you, President Pan.

95
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,000
We'll walk you to the car.

96
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,300
- Please. 
 - Goodbye.

97
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,400
Goodbye, Siyu.

98
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,200
- Brother Yang. 
 - Siyu.

99
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,700
I love you, Yiming.

100
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,000
Having you keeping him company is great.

101
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,990
I just arrived as well.

102
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,030
Brother Yang,

103
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:39,800
I must bother you to play basketball more with Yiming during this period.

104
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,400
What's wrong?

105
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,400
He has really been down recently. He keeps saying that he wants some quiet time.

106
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,400
Then just stays at home alone.

107
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,670
I'm afraid if he continues staying at home,

108
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,800
he will be wasted.

109
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,100
It will be fine after he finds a job.

110
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,400
Yes.

111
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,000
I have to help him find a job as soon as possible,

112
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:16,840
Brother Yang,

113
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,380
how far have you gotten with the bidding?

114
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:26,030
The notice will be sent out next week. I'll let you know in advance.

115
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:29,840
Great. I already put it on record at my company,

116
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,230
so I am representing Lubao in this bidding.

117
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:35,350
When the time comes, don't give attention to anyone else.

118
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:37,590
What do you mean? Are there other people?

119
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:41,660
The competition in our company is getting more and more heated.

120
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,820
Zhizhi said...

121
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:48,050
someone played you once.

122
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:49,690
Not just once.

123
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:52,500
There are public tricks and hidden tricks.

124
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,620
Then, how did you evade it?

125
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:58,550
Why evade? I need to fight them head-on.

126
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,990
Some people are like mosquitoes.

127
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:16,650
The more you try to evade, the stronger they come at you.

128
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:20,160
If you just kill them right away, it becomes peaceful again.

129
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,870
You're correct.

130
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,330
Here.

131
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,860
During a situation like that, I couldn't not sign it,

132
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,730
but after signing it,

133
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:51,210
my conscience isn't letting me get over it.

134
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,600
- Well, you already signed it. 
 - True.

135
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,750
I also will get to see what an Equestrian Club looks like. It seems quite good.

136
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,600
The Old Wu from my work, who I've talked to you about before,

137
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,090
is getting more and more unreasonable.

138
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:14,290
Originally I had planned on letting him off the hook, but now I think I need to counterattack.

139
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:17,820
How do you plan to do that?

140
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,790
This birthday party is already at the equestrian club, what kind of present can we even bring?

141
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,780
Why must you put so much effort into the birthday of a six-year-old kid?

142
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:34,060
If you have the time for that, then think of a way to deal with Mom.

143
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,200
Xiaoling gave me an idea about it today.

144
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,200
Can we please talk about something serious?

145
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:42,810
Is Yuwei's situation not serious? Is having another child not something serious?

146
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:46,290
Xiaoling gave me an idea.

147
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:51,190
We can just tell your mom that you have become infertile.

148
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:54,770
Then your mom will stop.

149
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:00,030
Are you joking? If this got out, do I not want to save face?

150
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:03,370
Are you annoyed by your mom's nagging? We have to figure out a solution.

151
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:05,100
This is not the solution.

152
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,920
Then, what should we do?

153
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,330
It can't be my problem.

154
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:19,410
The birthday present can't be less than ¥500. 

155
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:21,180
Go to sleep.

156
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:26,650
Here, Yuwei. Open your mouth. Eat some more.

157
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:30,370
After you finish, you'll grow as tall as your father.

158
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,200
Yang, I called your Second Aunt Liu last night.

159
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:39,640
- Which second aunt? 
 - The one who lives in the east of our house. The wife of that lame Liu.

160
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,860
When you were a baby, she even held you before.

161
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,040
Your second aunt calculated it,

162
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,870
and she said that it's because Yuwei's name is bad,

163
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:52,460
there's too much water. It repels the little brother. 
 (T/N The character "Yu" in Yuwei's name means rain.)

164
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:55,770
That's why you haven't had a son.

165
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,960
Mom, are you really that superstitious?

166
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:18,220
If you believe that, then my name has even more water. Do I have to change my name, too? 
 (T/N: the "Yang" in Liu Yang's name means ocean)

167
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,450
It has nothing to do with you.

168
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:23,030
It's Yuwei who has to change her name.

169
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,920
Dad, I'm not changing my name.

170
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,740
Yes, we won't change it.

171
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:31,280
How come you guys don't believe what I say?

172
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:37,080
Yang, in the past, you weren't like this.

173
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,970
Mom, I'm done eating.

174
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:48,140
What are you looking at? Hurry and eat.

175
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:03,610
Let's get a medical examination report.

176
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:09,320
You've thought it through?

177
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,940
Yes. I thought it through.

178
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,330
However, we have to say that there's something wrong with you, not me.

179
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:18,200
I don't want to lose face.

180
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:23,630
Fine.

181
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:42,560
Xiao Zhao...

182
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,150
Sit, sit.

183
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:47,090
I checked the data you were in charge of. It was very detailed.

184
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,720
It saved me a lot of work. Thanks for your work!

185
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,190
I'm especially busy these days,

186
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:54,920
and I'd like to trouble you with summarizing this file for me.

187
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,680
Finalize it into a formal bidding document.

188
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,570
Sure.

189
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:00,240
Thank you.

190
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:16,450
Come, just up this flight of stairs. It's this apartment here.

191
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:19,740
I told you I have many friends. It's all based on your requirements.

192
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,360
Here, let me give you the shoe covers.

193
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:26,330
Take a look.

194
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:28,900
If you don't like it, then we'll find another place.

195
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:43,470
Please come in.

196
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:45,150
Come in.

197
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:46,760
Take a look.

198
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:52,410
Here's the bathroom.

199
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:55,310
This is the kitchen.

200
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:03,180
An apartment with one living room and one bedroom now...

201
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:05,250
Look over here.

202
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:10,450
Look at the surrounding. It's very stylish.

203
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:13,060
It's very suitable for girls like you.

204
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:16,000
I looked at a bunch of apartments.

205
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,260
My friend said, "This one suits your girlfriend best."

206
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,440
Future girlfriend, I mean.

207
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,080
Take a look at the balcony.

208
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:41,050
This is the highlight.

209
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:52,940
Does it remind you of the Old Shanghai style?

210
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:55,240
This house is too old.

211
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:58,940
The house might be old, but the remodeling is new.

212
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,810
What's most important is the location.

213
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:04,640
This is in the city center but it's quite quiet for such a bustling area.

214
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,500
If it's so close to the metro, won't it be noisy?

215
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:11,100
Listen. Do you hear anything?

216
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:15,890
Do you know why? The flow of people from the metro station is northward.

217
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:19,250
This house is located south of the metro station.

218
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:22,480
But there is a snack street nearby.

219
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,140
People in and out, it'll be so noisy.

220
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:28,030
Having a snack street is great.

221
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:30,590
At night, when you're hungry, you can go and get a midnight snack.

222
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:33,080
- How convenient. 
 - Then won't I easily become fat?

223
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,860
You won't. I've already thought it through for you.

224
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:38,210
There are three gyms right over there.

225
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:40,690
There's a discount right now for memberships, too.

226
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,730
Is he the realtor or are you?

227
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:46,960
He is.

228
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,730
Come here.

229
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:51,860
- I'll introduce you. 
 - Miss Gu, what do you think?

230
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,600
Do you like it?

231
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:59,430
How much is it a month?

232
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:01,940
¥4500 per month and 2 months' rent as deposit.

233
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:04,860
- That expensive? 
 - It's not expensive.

234
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:07,320
Is he the realtor or are you?

235
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,130
- He is. 
 - Then shut up.

236
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:17,370
My old place was only ¥3,800.

237
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:22,780
W-Well, then ¥3800.

238
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:26,180
It's that easy? Then let me change my price. ¥3,500.

239
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,970
Wait, wait, wait.

240
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,620
You see, we have to have honor. Right?

241
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,690
If you said ¥3800, then it's ¥3800.

242
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,730
Do you take a commission in the middle?

243
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:39,320
God can bear witness. How can I take your commission?

244
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,700
Do I have a commission?

245
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,830
Then, why do you keep talking for him?

246
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:47,020
If you really don't believe me,

247
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,520
I'll give you my heart to show my sincerity. Here.

248
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,280
It stinks. Who wants to see that?

249
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:56,670
Miss Gu, then let's go to the office and sign the lease.

250
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,550
¥3500.

251
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:02,470
Brother, can't you step a step back?

252
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,910
For meaning's sake.

253
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,460
- Deal. 
 - Then can I move in tomorrow?

254
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,360
Once the lease is signed, I'll give you the key right away.

255
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,530
Okay. Deal!

256
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:17,150
As long as you like it. Take another look.

257
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:23,710
You really are something. A few words and I have to pay ¥500.

258
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:26,350
Bro, look at your girlfriend's appearance.

259
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:30,470
It would have been worth it even if it was ¥5,000 extra.

260
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:32,260
Go away, go away.

261
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:35,040
How is it?

262
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,230
- This bed— 
 - Don't touch my bed!

263
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:38,060
W-What? This bed is really

264
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:41,120
comfortable. Lie down.

265
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,740
Director, the new bidding document.

266
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,980
How was it? You won't have any more mistakes this time, right?

267
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:53,360
If there are any issues this time, I won't be able to face President Lu.

268
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:59,980
Okay. Leave it here. I'll look it over.

269
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:03,090
If there aren't any problems with it, I'll immediately hand it over to President Lu.

270
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:04,830
There definitely won't be any problems.

271
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:08,030
It's just that if we follow this proposal,

272
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:12,800
it will cost us over ¥8,000,000.

273
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:17,950
Liu Yang, what do you mean by that?

274
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:20,780
Director, the document in your hand

275
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:23,100
is the one that Xiao Zhao and Old Wu worked on.

276
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:25,800
I have another one here.

277
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,640
I, myself, verified all the data

278
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,740
to fix it.

279
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:38,920
The biggest difference between the two files is that

280
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:43,610
the first one has some sections done by Xiao Zhao and Old Wu,

281
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:47,720
so there is a very wasteful budget proposal;

282
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:52,430
while the other one doesn't have Xiao Zhao and Old Wu's contributions.

283
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,410
 Look at this. 

284
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:13,910
 Yes. 

285
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:16,160
This. Put this in the annex.

286
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,810
 All right. 

287
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:39,480
 Let's eat lunch together. To celebrate. 

288
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:46,770
Old Wu. Xiao Zhao. Director is looking for you.

289
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:58,600
- The braised pork you ordered. 
 - Thank you.

290
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,550
Let me tell you.

291
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:03,620
Director Wang didn't say anything in front of me.

292
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:07,050
But he transferred Old Wu to go retrieve and send files.

293
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:09,690
He transferred Xiao Zhao to reception.

294
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,250
I'm so happy to hear about it.

295
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,990
Oh right! Director Wang has agreed

296
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:20,590
to you joining my team officially so you can take part in the bidding project.

297
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:22,210
Really?

298
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:25,370
Then, does that mean I can learn real skills from you?

299
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:31,960
When the bidding is successfully over,

300
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:36,130
I'll personally go to Director Wang and have you officially stay on.

301
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:38,550
Thank you, Brother Yang.

302
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,540
I mean, Senior Brother.

303
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:48,160
Sorry, I don't know why I called you Brother Yang.

304
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,760
You can call me whatever you want to call me.

305
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:56,950
Then if I call you Brother Yang,

306
00:24:56,950 --> 00:25:00,080
then don't you need to call me something different, too?

307
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:09,950
Then, from now on... I'll call you... Little Sister Yun.

308
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:11,600
Okay!

309
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,560
Here, Little Sister Yun.

310
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,790
This time, I have to thank you.

311
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:21,820
If it weren't for you, then I don't know how big of a trap I would have fallen in.

312
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:25,180
Oh, Brother Yang, what I did was nothing.

313
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,790
With your talent and skills,

314
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:29,970
those little people can't touch you.

315
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:33,540
But it's still bothersome.

316
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:36,770
Brother Yang, from now on,

317
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:38,800
I'll be in your care.

318
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:46,570
Is the news accurate?

319
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:47,980
My uncle works there.

320
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:50,700
He said they were making a bidding document already.

321
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,580
- How much is it? 
 - Over ¥20 million.

322
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:56,420
By how much are we ahead of Li Siyu's team?

323
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,870
Only ¥300,000.

324
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:01,350
Didn't we close a deal of ¥5,000,000 with Daneng Group?

325
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:03,300
We didn't get it.

326
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:07,300
Sister Yuan had been negotiating with them for more than three months.

327
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,730
They said they found a new supplier.

328
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:11,850
I haven't asked about the specifics of the situation.

329
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:14,730
Then we must get this project.

330
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:16,680
Yes, if we get this bid,

331
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:20,220
then Sister Yuan becoming Sales Director will be set in stone.

332
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:23,090
Ask your uncle who will be in charge of the bidding,

333
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:26,950
and I'll need to know his personality and hobbies so I can get to know him better.

334
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:28,450
Okay.

335
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:36,030
President Guo, it's so hard to make an appointment with you.

336
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:38,570
It took me so long to be able to finally meet with you.

337
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:42,520
Then, today, we must finish this bottle of wine, or else no one can leave!

338
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:46,980
President Guo, I've been having some problems with my stomach recently.

339
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,630
I don't dare to drink.

340
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:51,050
How about just one cup?

341
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:54,760
I'm really not lying. Let me show you.

342
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,180
My bag is full of medicine for my stomach.

343
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,170
Okay, okay. You won't drink.

344
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:01,260
I'll drink, okay?

345
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:05,010
- Next time. 
 - Excuse me, let me take this phone call.

346
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:07,220
Hello?

347
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,570
All right, I understand.

348
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:16,680
Pay special attention to that matter for me.

349
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,680
I don't care about education or age.

350
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,260
I just want talent.

351
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,890
Right. Okay.

352
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:28,060
Take care of it, please.

353
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,660
Bye.

354
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:35,650
President Guo, is your company looking to hire?

355
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:39,190
Our Publicity Department needs a director.

356
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:42,890
Then, should I recommend someone for you?

357
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:44,800
Great!

358
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,700
Pass it.

359
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,430
Kick it in.

360
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:51,370
Yes! Yes!

361
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:53,900
Almost. Almost.

362
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:56,580
It was too dangerous.

363
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,740
Yiming,

364
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,400
why are you drinking water? Drink alcohol!

365
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,840
I drove today, I can't drink today. I'll drink with you another time.

366
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:17,260
Hey, Yiming. How come I heard that you're looking for a job?

367
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:20,180
Fenglin Company is in need of a copywriting planner.

368
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:23,720
Are you interested? I can recommend you.

369
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,970
Do you know how to speak?

370
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:28,910
Yiming was a planning director before.

371
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:32,070
Now you're telling him to apply for a copywriter position. Is he out of his mind?

372
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:34,310
Doesn't it degrade him?

373
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:37,760
Don't listen to Haowen. I just want to take a break.

374
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,400
I don't want to think about applying to jobs at the moment.

375
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,360
- Okay, I got it. 
 - Thank you!

376
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:47,620
Cheers, guys!

377
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,790
Send me your newest resume.

378
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:53,210
Yes! Yes!

379
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:55,850
Drink!

380
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:58,920
?

381
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,660
Nice!

382
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:04,540
Quick, quick, I'm waiting for you!

383
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,400
[Chen Yiming's Resume - Sent]

384
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,650
 What company is it? 

385
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:22,560
What position?

386
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,770
President Guo, I've just sent the résumé to your phone.

387
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:36,160
I got it. I'll send it to our Human Resources director immediately.

388
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:40,460
President Gu, thank you.

389
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:42,680
A toast to you!

390
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:49,670
Didn't you say you can't drink?

391
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:51,580
I'm happy today so I must even if I can't.

392
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,570
Okay!

393
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:56,720
Sit, sit. Cheers.

394
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:01,020
[What company? What position?]

395
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:04,510
Where are you right now? Who are you with?

396
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:09,440
Little Sister, look. We've collaborated for so many years,

397
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,830
and you've always been so delightful.

398
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:14,870
That's why you are the Big Bro.

399
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,940
Our Director of Human Resources asked

400
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,970
if this Mr. Chen Yiming...

401
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:29,830
- can come to the company tomorrow to have an interview? 
 - He can.

402
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:32,000
No problem. What time tomorrow?

403
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:34,180
10:00 a.m.

404
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:36,390
I'll let him know right away.

405
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:41,430
President Guo, thank you so much.

406
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:43,560
I must make another toast to you!

407
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,480
There's no more.

408
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:51,320
How about we have another bottle?

409
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:55,020
- Another bottle! 
 - Waiter, one more bottle!

410
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:04,530
I'm going to go make a call.

411
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:13,470
President Guo, I'm going to take this call.

412
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:15,360
Waiter!

413
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:29,920
- Another bottle of wine. 
 - Got it.

414
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:39,080
- Hey, Siyu. 
 - Yiming, I have good news.

415
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:43,340
Go to the company tomorrow at 10:00 a.m. for an interview. I'll send you the address on WeChat.

416
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:47,570
Did you drink? Didn't you say you weren't going to drink today?

417
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:49,720
I have a lot of good news today.

418
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:53,910
I just signed a contract and found you a job!

419
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:59,640
Send me the address. I'll go pick you up right now.

420
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:20,020
Is this curable?

421
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:23,440
I have blocked fallopian tubes. It's incurable.

422
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:26,980
What if the doctor made a mistake...

423
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:31,030
This was diagnosed by the hospital's director. It can't be wrong.

424
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:36,400
I went with Zhizhi. This specialist is pretty famous.

425
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,630
We wouldn't have even been able to see him if we didn't know someone with connections.

426
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,510
- Mom! 
 - Mom!

427
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:45,440
Are you okay?

428
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,730
Let me take some time...

429
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:31,910
Mom!

430
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,470
This worked well.

431
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,220
I'm a bit worried now.

432
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:05,230
I'm worried that she can't take such a big disappointment.

433
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:08,210
I think she is a bit disappointed.

434
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:10,120
We should show her more concern.

435
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,490
Let Yuwei spend more time with her.

436
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:15,060
It will probably be fine.

437
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:20,000
Let's hope so.

438
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:24,170
- I'll help you.
 - No, I'll help you. I'll help you.

439
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:26,600
- I'm fine. 
 - I'm fine. The car is there.

440
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,920
- The car's here. I'm fine. I'm fine. 
 - I'll help you.

441
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:33,530
Be careful. Walk slower.

442
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:37,790
President Guo, I'll be honest with you.

443
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:40,410
The Mr. Chen who's interviewing tomorrow

444
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:43,660
- is my boyfriend. 
 - Really?

445
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:46,160
He's really outstanding.

446
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:49,480
Otherwise, I wouldn't like him.

447
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:52,770
That's true. Let me tell you.

448
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:56,780
A guy that can hold onto someone like you

449
00:34:56,780 --> 00:35:00,140
definitely wouldn't be someone ordinary.

450
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:03,330
You definitely won't regret it if you hire him.

451
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:05,780
How about this?

452
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:08,550
He doesn't have to do an interview.

453
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:13,500
Just tell him that he can come to the company tomorrow and directly complete the paperwork to be employed.

454
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:16,420
- Really? 
 - Really!

455
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:20,810
- President Guo, thank you so much! 
 - I have to thank you.

456
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:25,350
Don't worry,

457
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:28,080
- I definitely won't treat him badly. 
 - Thank you so much.

458
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:31,310
You don't have to be so polite to me.

459
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:34,160
I'm not being too polite to you. I'm worried that you drank too much.

460
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:37,380
All right then, just don't worry.

461
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:40,190
I'll help you watch him.

462
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:42,590
Thank you, Big Bro.

463
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:44,400
Okay, I'm leaving.

464
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,260
- I'm leaving. 
 - Be careful.

465
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:10,920
Yiming?

466
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:13,990
Why didn't you get here a minute earlier?

467
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:16,950
If you were a minute earlier, you could've met President Guo.

468
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:22,330
What's wrong? Smile a bit!

469
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:24,720
What's wrong?

470
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:30,760
Yiming. Yiming!

471
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:52,740
Can you give me a kiss?

472
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,000
Honey water.

473
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,910
Drink some honey water to alleviate the alcohol.

474
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,540
I got it done.

475
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:24,620
President Guo said that you don't have to interview.

476
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:27,370
You can go straight to work tomorrow.

477
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:30,560
Publicity Department Director.

478
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,830
It just so happens to be your profession.

479
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,250
I'm not going.

480
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:40,640
Why not?

481
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:47,460
Be safe, sit properly.

482
00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:03,140
Yiming, you said that you want to take a pause, calm down,

483
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:06,110
and think it through. I support you.

484
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:09,170
But you can't think forever.

485
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:11,410
You can't just keep staying at home.

486
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:13,750
If you keep staying at home, you'll become a waste.

487
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:17,490
You have to go out. You have to go out and work.

488
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:22,810
I've already found a job.

489
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:25,960
You found a job?

490
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,040
Which company?

491
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,960
Fenglin Enterprise.

492
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,400
- Is the company big? 
 - It's okay.

493
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,150
What will you do there?

494
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:41,200
Copywriting planner.

495
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:48,800
President is offering you the Publicity Department Director position.

496
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,530
Even though his company isn't big,

497
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:52,680
but it's very stable in the industry.

498
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:56,070
- And last year it was labeled as China's top ten— 
 - Forget it.

499
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:00,240
I'm still going to Fenglin.

500
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:04,520
- Why? 
 - No reason.

501
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,790
Is it because...

502
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:19,190
your salary at Fenglin is really high?

503
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,510
Or the company's prospects are great?

504
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:23,900
It's not any of that.

505
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:30,730
Yiming, I don't really understand.

506
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:34,180
Any normal person would choose President Guo's company.

507
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:36,260
Then just consider me not normal.

508
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:42,840
What is it? Tell me the truth.

509
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:51,170
I don't want you to...

510
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:54,770
suffer because of me.

511
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:59,060
I didn't suffer.

512
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:03,250
I just drank a bottle of white wine with President Guo.

513
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:15,790
Are you unhappy because I drank with a client?

514
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:19,960
- I'm not that selfish. 
 - Then what's the reason?

515
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:13,660
You should still go to President Guo's company tomorrow. Tomorrow morning at 10:00.

516
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:16,230
I've already told you. I won't go.

517
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:18,160
You—

518
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,420
Are you done? If you're done then go and rest.

519
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:12,400
Why does it have to be like this?

520
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:17,260
Why must they treat me like this?

00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:49,240
♫  Some sweet and some hopeless  ♫

526
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:54,090
♫  There are also some that were never said  ♫

527
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:57,780
♫  It's been so long, I've already learned to let go  ♫

528
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:02,250
♫  Let go of obsessions, of the present, and of greed  ♫

529
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:07,490
♫  Yet I've never thought of letting you go  ♫

530
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:10,610
♫  Yeah…  ♫

531
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:14,030
♫  Oh…  ♫

532
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:15,680
♫  En…  ♫

533
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,060
♫  Letting go…  ♫

534
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:20,440
♫  Dear Myself  ♫

535
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:23,540
♫  Listen to the voice inside  ♫

536
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:27,490
♫  In this lonely world, be cautious ♫

537
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:29,960
 After we're hurt, we learn to cherish  ♫

538
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:33,130
♫  Dear Myself  ♫

539
00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:36,610
♫  Use all your strength  ♫

540
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:40,750
♫  Missing the simple you from the past  ♫

541
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:43,010
♫  Turn difficulties into courage  ♫

542
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:46,980
♫  Don't back down from the crowd  ♫

543
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:50,290
♫  Growth is inevitably accompanied by setbacks  ♫

544
00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:53,060
♫  The best way to overcome difficulties is to smile  ♫

545
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:55,130
♫  All the punishment given by fate, are you afraid?  ♫

546
00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:57,250
♫  Let everything go, all those concerns, real or fake  ♫

547
00:44:57,250 --> 00:45:00,390
♫  Cannot erase the scar, but it's just a scar  ♫

548
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:02,120
♫  We are so small yet so determined  ♫

549
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:03,870
♫  Occasionally fussy and occasionally firm  ♫

550
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:06,370
♫  If growth leaves a trace, then the trace is left be tears  ♫

551
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:09,910
♫  Your back that I've always been chasing  ♫

552
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:12,090
♫  Finally turned around to hug me tightly  ♫

553
00:45:12,090 --> 00:45:15,740
♫  It's still that familiar you  ♫

554
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:19,150
♫  Yeah..  ♫

555
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:23,080
♫  Oh..  ♫

556
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:28,550
♫  Dear Myself  ♫

557
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:31,960
♫  Listen to the voice inside  ♫

558
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:35,980
♫  I'll give you the warm that the wind took  ♫

559
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:38,270
♫  Hugging you, hugging me  ♫

560
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:41,610
♫   Dear Myself  ♫

561
00:45:41,610 --> 00:45:45,700
♫  The sky has finally cleared  ♫

562
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:48,970
♫  We've never been so clear-headed  ♫

563
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:51,030
♫  Looking for the past me who  ♫

564
00:45:51,030 --> 00:45:54,620
♫  Ran forward without evading anything  ♫

565
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:57,890
♫  Ran forward without evading anything  ♫

566
00:45:57,890 --> 00:46:01,200
♫  Listen to the voice inside  ♫

567
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:05,600
♫  The sky has finally cleared  ♫
