00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:27,875
[To Dear Myself]

2
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:32,425
[Ep16]

3
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:36,400
It's true

4
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,200
Sister Ziru told HR department about your post and salary in my presence

5
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:44,719
You just go to work

6
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:45,400
Wait...

7
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,239
Stop talking

8
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:48,875
Let me process

9
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,600
She has so many talents to choose from

10
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,840
Why does she choose me?

11
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,359
Because you are excellent

12
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,439
Tell me the truth

13
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:06,599
How did you beg Mr. Wang?

14
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:09,550
Did you promise her any condition?

15
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,479
Nothing at all

16
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,875
Sister Ziru admires your talent for a long time

17
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,975
I just told her you resigned

18
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,919
She immediately asked you to work in her company

19
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:19,759
That's all?

20
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:21,919
Yiming, don't worry

21
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,680
Sister Ziru is not stupid

22
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,250
If you are mediocre, she won't hire you

23
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,350
But I only met her twice

24
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,080
But your resume is great

25
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,759
Resume?

26
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,280
I have sent that resume for over 50 times

27
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,039
No reply

28
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:39,080
Why do I...

29
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,250
Not all bosses are talent scouts

30
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:50,739
Not all job seekers have girlfriends like you

31
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:53,520
I did nothing

32
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,000
Siyu

33
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:07,800
Thank you

34
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,039
Don't need to thank me

35
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:16,120
I do this also for myself

36
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,719
Yiming

37
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,199
I don't want you to go back

38
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,400
I don't want to have a long-distance relationship with you

39
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,200
I don't want to face unforeseeable future

40
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:31,719
I don't want, either

41
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,080
Huizhong

42
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:53,400
Sorry

43
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,199
It's ok, brother

44
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,719
I know you did your best

45
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,679
I have told my friends about you

46
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,000
They are very interested in your qualifications and abilities

47
00:04:06,725 --> 00:04:09,599
So you don't need to worry about work

48
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:12,120
Brother

49
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,199
Thank you

50
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:18,150
But I don't want to

51
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,240
What will you do?

52
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,399
Todau Mengmeng's teacher called me

53
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:33,300
She scolded me and she said I am an unqualified parent

54
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:39,325
These teachers are so ridiculous

55
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,759
I feel I am a loser

56
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,279
I have worked for 13 years there

57
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,279
Finally I am fired

58
00:04:51,975 --> 00:04:58,250
My apprentice turns against me

59
00:05:01,775 --> 00:05:06,199
My son is the poorest student in class

60
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:09,319
Don't be discouraged

61
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:13,525
People like Li Siyu won't ride on the crest of success for too long

62
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:18,160
Lubao

63
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:20,480
Li Siyu

64
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,439
Just let bygones be bygones

65
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,050
I just want to find a simple work

66
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,480
I don't care about the salary

67
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:41,225
So I can take care of Mengmeng every day

68
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:43,879
I will help him with his grades

69
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:47,240
Fine

70
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,600
I have to go now

71
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,680
Mengmeng's tuition is over

72
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,560
I have to pick him up

73
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:57,839
Bye

74
00:05:57,839 --> 00:05:58,480
Ok

75
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:00,519
Bye bye

76
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,350
Now even Wei Yayun can command me

77
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,399
What an irony

78
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:38,160
I'm no better than you

79
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:44,035
A graduate from 985 university works as a receptionist

80
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:45,519
Wu

81
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:48,560
So that's all for my life?

82
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,399
Of course not

83
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:51,120
We still have a chance

84
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,439
Chance?

85
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,800
Where is it?

86
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:01,160
From my experience, all bids have dirty tricks

87
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,152
Liu Yang drives us away deliberately

88
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:08,425
He thinks we stand in the way

89
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:11,750
But we are kicked out now

90
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:14,800
Even if there is some dirty trick, we just don't know

91
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:21,160
We don't know

92
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,959
We can start from the outside

93
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:29,959
I have the list of companies' paper for bid

94
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:31,879
You go to check it

95
00:07:33,175 --> 00:07:35,839
I think, one of them has something to do with Liu Yang

96
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:37,600
How to check?

97
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,040
The Internet is so advanced now

98
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,040
You want me to teach you?

99
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,319
It's my honor to join Tianyi Group

100
00:07:58,425 --> 00:08:00,920
So happy to work with you

101
00:08:01,425 --> 00:08:05,680
I am confident that I will make planning department

102
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,575
an important department for Tianyi Group

103
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,800
I believe under the leadership of Mr. Chen,

104
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,319
planning department will go to the next level

105
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,759
Thank you

106
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:15,480
Mr. Chen

107
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:16,560
Your office is inside

108
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,160
Ok

109
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:18,319
Sit

110
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:25,439
Mr. Chen

111
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,920
Do you need any help?

112
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,920
No

113
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,480
I'll go back to work now

114
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:31,600
Thank you

115
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,360
You take me to this wilderness

116
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,639
What do you want?

117
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:41,519
You even inebriate me

118
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,519
What's your purpose?

119
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:45,759
Say it

120
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:47,639
I am happy today

121
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,960
I will do as you say

122
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,639
I have no purpose

123
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,279
I just want to have a little walk with you

124
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:56,240
Walk?

125
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,399
Ok

126
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:05,919
Be careful

127
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:09,320
Why are you so slow?

128
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:10,759
Hurry

129
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,559
Fireworks

130
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:20,840
These two

131
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,799
Let's celebrate it

132
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:26,320
Ok

133
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,120
Congratulations

134
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:32,759
Find your place again

135
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:35,279
Congratulations

136
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You are sales director now

137
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,075
Your dream comes true

138
00:10:41,175 --> 00:10:44,960
So in the future, every time we achieve a dream 

139
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:48,480
we will light a firework to celebrate it

140
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,039
Ok

141
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:53,240
I think we should get a bigger one today

142
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:54,519
Come  -Ok

143
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,000
Drone

144
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:46,320
Take it

145
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:06,360
Siyu

146
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,679
Your husband accepts your offer now

147
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:35,600
Actually I should have accepted long ago

148
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,475
But I want to give you the best of me

149
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:41,840
A safest future

150
00:12:43,325 --> 00:12:44,564
So it took so long

151
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:51,700
After these difficulties,

152
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:58,911
I have a deeper understanding about you, me and us

153
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:02,759
Siyu, don't worry

154
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:08,919
I will work hard 

155
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,271
I will prove I am the best with the rest of my life

156
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,559
I am your Mr. Right

157
00:13:57,559 --> 00:13:59,320
So this is proposal?

158
00:13:59,320 --> 00:13:59,879
Yeah

159
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:01,120
This is my proposal

160
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:45,840
Great

161
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:46,279
Great

162
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:47,360
So happy

163
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,639
What happened to you?

164
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,320
Nothing

165
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:08,120
Because of this painting?

166
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:19,879
Xiaoling

167
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,240
I have been looking for you

168
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:27,480
I'm here all along

169
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,639
Ten years ago

170
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,360
the first time I saw this painting

171
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:34,559
I cried too

172
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,279
Many people don't understand why

173
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:39,559
But only I know it

174
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,039
What touched me?

175
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:43,519
Xiaoling

176
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:46,840
We are the same kind of people

177
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,159
Be my girlfriend

178
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:54,559
You know me

179
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,039
I know you too

180
00:16:00,575 --> 00:16:04,325
This exhibition includes clothing, sculpture

181
00:16:04,325 --> 00:16:06,960
visual art and interactive installations, etc

182
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,425
As you can see, it shows

183
00:16:10,425 --> 00:16:12,966
social networks's change on people's mind and behavior

184
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:14,960
And an influence

185
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:16,639
Hi, Danny

186
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:17,960
Hi, Bruce

187
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,480
Long time no see

188
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:25,240
Yeah

189
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,039
Your exhibition is great

190
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:28,639
Very nice  -Thank you...

191
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:32,162
I like painting and its history

192
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:34,960
Like it, yeah

193
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,279
It's great

194
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,000
Every moment is certain

195
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:45,582
But every next moment is uncertain

196
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:56,720
Where did you go?

197
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,840
Who do you send messages to?

198
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:02,519
Did you see it?

199
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:04,359
The top floor of that house

200
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:06,039
I have told you

201
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,000
That famous collector's apartment

202
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,119
Take a look

203
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,480
So low-key

204
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,880
Yeah, low-key enough

205
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,480
Right?

206
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,000
Liu Yang

207
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:21,105
Sister Siyu accepted brother Yiming's proposal

208
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:22,358
Great

209
00:17:22,358 --> 00:17:22,959
Congratulations to them

210
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,561
I want to invite Siyu and Yiming to dinner here

211
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:27,960
First...

212
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,920
I'm having a meeting

213
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:46,400
So fantastic

214
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,119
I still don't believe it

215
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,920
It's too late to change your mind

216
00:17:57,475 --> 00:17:59,759
Do we really get married?

217
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:06,759
You think I am kidding?

218
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:11,160
Yiming

219
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,975
Actually I don't know how to be a wife

220
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:22,240
You think, I know how to be a husband?

221
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,519
It's my first marriage, ok?

222
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:33,175
But I believe we can get used to it 

223
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,359
and work hard together

224
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:37,599
And explore together

225
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,038
So what's the next step?

226
00:18:48,925 --> 00:18:51,799
Next is a realistic link

227
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:59,440
Talk about dowry?

228
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:02,759
Talk about the wedding room

229
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,680
Siyu

230
00:19:07,275 --> 00:19:09,720
I have saved about a million 

231
00:19:10,525 --> 00:19:13,240
It's enough for down payment of two-bedroom house

232
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:16,089
I think we should buy a three-bedroom house

233
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:18,279
One for us and one for kid

234
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,625
In case Zhizhi or Xiaoling has dispute with her husband

235
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,325
But three-bedroom house in a better location is at least 5 million 

236
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,004
I don't have enough money for down payment now

237
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,839
I have half a million

238
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:38,839
No

239
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,680
Your money is your money

240
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,559
How can I use your money?

241
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:49,375
How can you like my appearance other than my money?

242
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,200
Siyu

243
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:58,160
We have been together for years

244
00:19:59,575 --> 00:20:01,920
I know I am not good enough for you

245
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:10,401
If you pay down payment, I really can't accept it

246
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,119
Chen Yiming, let me tell you

247
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:18,759
Today you need to take me and money at the same time

248
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,279
Or you will get nothing

249
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,880
What are you doing?

250
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,680
What do you want?

251
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,759
What do you want?

252
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:29,039
Only 500,000

253
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,200
Remember, you need to work for me for a lifetime

254
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,759
Actually I win

255
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,359
Siyu

256
00:20:40,075 --> 00:20:42,440
You can ingratiate yourself with me

257
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,575
As I know, you have a new director in your department

258
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,799
He took office last week

259
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:12,720
How's it?

260
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,200
Not very good

261
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,759
Why can he be a director?

262
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,160
As I know, he is a leader's son-in-law

263
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:19,599
President Wang can't refuse it

264
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:22,950
So she transfers He away to save a spot for him

265
00:21:23,975 --> 00:21:27,319
No wonder He was suddenly transferred away

266
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,119
It's He's blessing in disguise

267
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:31,900
He is promoted to branch's boss from the planning director

268
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,160
Director Chen

269
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,519
Director Chen

270
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,519
You didn't attend the meeting?

271
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,240
What meeting?

272
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:16,119
Wednesday's regular meeting

273
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,350
All directors need to attend

274
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,640
Thank you

275
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:27,491
800 million has 20% stock equity

276
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:31,079
So Lubao is four billion in total

277
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,924
It's a good price in previous years

278
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,875
But now, it's not a favorable price

279
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:39,680
So what's your take?

280
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,515
According to the finance company 's valuation model

281
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:44,519
3 billion is ok

282
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:45,880
3 billion

283
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,279
I think it's a little high

284
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:55,319
Sorry

285
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,000
I did not receive the meeting notice

286
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:00,960
Amy

287
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:04,680
Remember to notify director Chen

288
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:07,960
Ok

289
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:09,240
Director Chen

290
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:10,839
Come sit here

291
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:12,960
It's ok

292
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,200
I just sit here

293
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:15,920
Director Chen

294
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:17,119
Your place is here

295
00:23:41,079 --> 00:23:41,920
President Wang

296
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,680
So what's your take?

297
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,359
Let's not talk about this now

298
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:51,175
Any updates about financial openness?

299
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,631
We hold this meeting to evaluate Lubao, right?

300
00:23:55,025 --> 00:23:57,079
We are going for the next round of negotiations

301
00:23:57,079 --> 00:23:59,319
We need to get an answer today

302
00:24:08,925 --> 00:24:12,000
As I know, the new policy will adjust the ratio 

303
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,079
of indirect financing and direct financing

304
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,680
Any more?

305
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:24,799
President Wang

306
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,200
I made an appointment with a client today

307
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,600
We are going to talk about our company's brand image

308
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:32,039
Ok

309
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:33,039
Go

310
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,079
Ok

311
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,200
I'll go now

312
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:35,640
Ok

313
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,079
Ok

314
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,599
I'm sorry, everyone

315
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:38,880
Bye

316
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,200
Ok

317
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:55,640
Go on

318
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:57,960
Well

319
00:24:58,775 --> 00:25:01,000
Xingxing's father likes your cookies

320
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:01,839
Really?

321
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:02,799
I love it, too

322
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:03,799
Yeah

323
00:25:03,799 --> 00:25:05,960
Ok, I'll make more and bring it tomorrow

324
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,519
Ok

325
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:07,519
No

326
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:08,720
Make some Napoleon

327
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,200
I love Napoleon

328
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,599
I love Napoleon, too

329
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:12,480
Napoleon is delicious

330
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:13,039
Delicious

331
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:13,720
It's plain

332
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,559
Ok, I will make some

333
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:16,440
Thank you

334
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,319
Yuwei's mom

335
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,359
The school is over

336
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:21,359
They are coming out

337
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:22,440
Line up

338
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,000
Line up

339
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:23,920
Line up

340
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:25,480
Your son

341
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,839
Yeah, my grandson

342
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:29,550
Are you ok?

343
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,440
What's wrong with you?

344
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:31,960
Come...

345
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:33,799
He is not ok

346
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:34,519
Look

347
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:35,559
It's swollen 

348
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:37,359
Sorry

349
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:38,400
I am so sorry

350
00:25:38,875 --> 00:25:40,519
We can take him to the hospital now

351
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:41,359
Of course

352
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:42,880
Maybe it's a concussion

353
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:44,079
Ok, grandma

354
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,319
I will go with you

355
00:25:45,319 --> 00:25:46,400
Wait a moment

356
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:48,000
He has a younger sister

357
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,575
We will go together after we pick her up

358
00:25:50,839 --> 00:25:51,799
No, go now

359
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,799
Grandma, his sister is still little

360
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:54,759
No

361
00:25:54,839 --> 00:25:56,079
You only care about your children

362
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:57,599
What about my grandson?

363
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:58,240
Forget it...

364
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,079
Go now

365
00:25:59,079 --> 00:25:59,680
Grandma

366
00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:01,039
Grandma, don't be angry

367
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:01,359
Go

368
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:01,880
Go

369
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,880
Why are you hitting me?

370
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,440
I didn't harm you

371
00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:07,559
What's the problem?

372
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,839
Serve you right

373
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:09,880
Stop it

374
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:11,359
Who told you to cut in?

375
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:12,359
None of your business

376
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:13,240
Stop it, don't be angry

377
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:13,799
Stop fighting

378
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,960
Stop it

379
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,359
Let me go

380
00:26:18,425 --> 00:26:19,559
She hit me

381
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:20,920
You should stop her

382
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,960
Why are you stopping me?

383
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,119
Are you friends?

384
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:24,160
It's ok now

385
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:26,359
Come...

386
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:28,319
Come here...

387
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,920
Yuwei's mom

388
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:33,640
We do this for your own good

389
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,759
Think

390
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,440
The grandma is so old

391
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,720
If you have a conflit and hurt her by accident

392
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,799
you will be in a big trouble

393
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:41,319
Yes

394
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:43,000
Even if you don't hurt her

395
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,625
what if she deliberately extorts you?

396
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,119
It will invite trouble

397
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,000
Am I right?

398
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:47,960
Yes

399
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,680
Exactly

400
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,000
We are helping you

401
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,839
We let her hit you

402
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:54,519
So she could calm down

403
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,000
Am I wrong?

404
00:26:58,675 --> 00:27:00,995
You know who his son is?

405
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:03,640
It's the principal of the international elementary school nearby

406
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:07,150
It's so hard to go to that school even if parents have money

407
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,075
But the principal said in the next three years

408
00:27:09,075 --> 00:27:11,435
he will consider our kindergarten's kids first

409
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:12,880
Why?

410
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,000
All because his kid is in this kindergarten

411
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:16,960
If you irriate the grandma

412
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,599
they will transfer the grandson to another kindergarten

413
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,480
The promise will be invalid

414
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,350
All the kindergarten's kids won't be admitted to that elementary school

415
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:25,200
Including your Yuwei

416
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:26,759
Do you understand?

417
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:31,480
Kids are out

418
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,319
They are coming

419
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:33,319
Miaomiao, go...

420
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:35,319
Miaomiao

421
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:35,960
Xingxing

422
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:36,559
Come here

423
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:39,375
How's today?

424
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,319
Yuwei's mom

425
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:42,599
Don't forget to bring Napoleon

426
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:44,880
Let's go

427
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,440
Don't forget my cookies tomorrow

428
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,519
I want more

429
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:49,920
Go

430
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:51,839
Yuwei's mom

431
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:52,680
I drive today

432
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,880
Do you want me to give you ride?

433
00:27:55,319 --> 00:27:55,880
Bye

434
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,039
Get in the car, go

435
00:27:57,599 --> 00:27:58,000
Hurry

436
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,039
Mom

437
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:05,640
What happened to you?

438
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:07,200
Mom

439
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:09,240
Mom

440
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,200
Why are you crying?

441
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,519
Mom

442
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:15,839
What happened to you?

443
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:29,799
Liu Yang

444
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,640
Change this sentence

445
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:37,960
Ok

446
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,599
I need th loo

447
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:39,160
Ok

00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,075
Hello, the subscriber you dialed is busy now

449
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:27,599
Sorry

450
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:34,680
Hello, the subscriber you dialed is busy now

451
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:39,025
Sorry, the subscriber you dialed is busy now

452
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:09,039
Go home

453
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:27,119
Girl

454
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,680
Girl

455
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,720
Chinese Studies Training Class

456
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,519
Hello

457
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,319
Hello

458
00:30:59,925 --> 00:31:02,440
I like the houses for rent on your app

459
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:05,279
I want to make an appointment

460
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,000
Ok

461
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,720
Let's contact online

462
00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:12,119
Ok

463
00:31:12,759 --> 00:31:13,839
Ok

464
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:14,640
Goodbye

465
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,480
President Wang

466
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:37,960
President Wang

467
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,440
President Wang

468
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:46,720
Yiming

469
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:47,519
President Wang

470
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,150
I want to explain the meeting to you

471
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:55,039
It's ok

472
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:57,425
You know we are talking 

473
00:31:57,425 --> 00:31:59,425
about equity financing with Lubao, right?

474
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:01,200
About Lubao's valuation

475
00:32:01,475 --> 00:32:04,200
I have negotiated with president Pan for many times

476
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,169
I think you know Lubao's valuation best

477
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,200
But today's meeting

478
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:14,075
I specifically notified HR department not to tell you

479
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:16,960
I get it

480
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:20,900
You are afraid I will leak the company's secret

481
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,160
No

482
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,880
I believe in your professional ethics

483
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,920
You won't do that

484
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:27,839
I don't want to get you in dilemma

485
00:32:30,759 --> 00:32:31,799
You and siyu

486
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:33,400
One is an executive of Tianye

487
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,880
One is an executive of Lubao

488
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:38,559
If Siyu asks you about Tianyi's strategy

489
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:41,839
if you tell her, you will be sorry for company

490
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:44,720
If you don't tell her, it will affect your love

491
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:48,000
So I think you don't need to know

492
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:51,640
Thank you

493
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:52,960
President Wang

494
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,799
Thank you for being so considerate

495
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,319
Hope you can understand

496
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,319
I can understand

497
00:32:58,319 --> 00:32:59,079
Of course

498
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:03,680
Come

499
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:29,319
Who is responsible for Lubao Group's brand valuation?

500
00:33:29,319 --> 00:33:30,319
Wang

501
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:31,480
But he gets off work now

502
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,279
I have a backup

503
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:36,960
Ok

504
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,028
Give me all Lubao Group's public data

505
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:41,119
Ok

506
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:41,759
Ok

507
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:57,880
Director Chen

508
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:00,799
All here?

509
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,480
Yes

510
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:02,839
Ok

511
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:05,200
You should get off work now

512
00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:06,200
Ok

513
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,760
You are not sleeping?

514
00:34:28,925 --> 00:34:30,559
Why you didn't answer my calls?

515
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,079
Did you?

516
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:39,320
I have no missed calls

517
00:34:39,518 --> 00:34:40,558
You didn't WeChat me, other

518
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,025
Don't ask me why I called you?

519
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,039
You can tell me now

520
00:34:53,125 --> 00:34:57,840
I want to transfer Yuwei back to bluesky kindergarten

521
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:01,480
What did you say?

522
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:05,280
I will go through the formalities tomorrow

523
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:19,000
You forget how hard we tried to transfer Yuwei out of bluesky?

524
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:20,800
Now you want to go back

525
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:26,650
So, all the money, the time, energy and debt we owe are ruined now

526
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,320
I will transfer her back

527
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:32,514
Yuwei was doing great in bluesky

528
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,880
You said, Yuwei needs to receive more elite education

529
00:35:36,039 --> 00:35:37,119
So you transferred her

530
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:39,480
Now she is doing great in Jinguduo

531
00:35:40,125 --> 00:35:41,400
What do you want?

532
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:44,079
I am wrong, ok?

533
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,440
I don't need Yuwei to receive elite education

534
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:51,250
I just need her to be an ordinary girl, ok?

535
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,400
What are you doing here, so noisy?

536
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:01,199
Zhizhi wants to change Yuwei' kindergarten

537
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:02,039
Is it true?

538
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:02,800
Yes

539
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:03,760
What's wrong?

540
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,480
I disagree

541
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,639
Whether you agree or not

542
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:08,519
I will transfer, tomorrow

543
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,159
It's late in night

544
00:36:12,159 --> 00:36:13,239
Are you insane?

545
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,360
Yuwei is just familiar with the environment of new kindergarten

546
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,440
You want to transfer again

547
00:36:18,825 --> 00:36:20,679
You are not afraid to leave her some psychological shadow?

548
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,225
And we just paid the tuition of this semester

549
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,750
If you transfer now, the tuition of 30,000 yuan

550
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,159
they will only return half of it at most

551
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,559
I will transfer

552
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,679
No

553
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,480
You only think about money

554
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:37,960
I was bullied today

555
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,679
They bullied me together

556
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,280
What happened?

557
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,760
Mom...

558
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,840
I am coming

559
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,440
Coming

560
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:50,440
All right

561
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,559
Yuwei, I am here...

562
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:52,960
Come

563
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:54,559
Come, go to bed

564
00:36:55,025 --> 00:36:55,585
Good girl

565
00:36:56,199 --> 00:36:57,920
They bullied me together

566
00:36:58,639 --> 00:37:02,351
After that, they said they did that for my own good

567
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:04,039
Voice down

568
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,760
Don't wake Yuwei up again

569
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,639
Gosh

570
00:37:09,639 --> 00:37:13,225
I have told you, including Miaomiao's mom

571
00:37:13,675 --> 00:37:15,559
Get away from them

572
00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:17,039
But you don't listen

573
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Yuwei enters Jinguduo

574
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,119
You should let her finish this semester first

575
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:26,760
Snd you just need to stay away from Miaomiao's mom

576
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,079
Can't you think for me?

577
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:30,440
Keep your voice down

578
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,000
Voice down

579
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,950
You want to transfer Yuwei back just because of this?

580
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,639
Don't make a fuss, ok?

581
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,559
I am not

582
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:43,320
I was bullied

583
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,800
Can you stop being emotionally fragile?

584
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:48,360
Emotionally fragile?

585
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:49,199
Ok

586
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,199
You are not

587
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:52,559
I can tell you

588
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:56,800
In life and workplace, it's common

589
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,719
You just need to bear with it

590
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,159
No

591
00:38:00,725 --> 00:38:04,550
If I were you, I would have resigned thousands of times

592
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:07,960
No

593
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:09,480
Ok, tell me your thoughts

594
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,519
I...

595
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,000
Zhizhi

596
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:14,960
We are adults

597
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,800
Adults should solve problems rather than avoid them

598
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:21,625
You can't just transfer her back to bluesky kindergarten

599
00:38:21,625 --> 00:38:22,639
Don't make troubles for me, ok?

600
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,000
Anyway, Yuwei can't stay in this kindergarten

601
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,639
Let me ask you

602
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:33,850
If you are bullied again after 

603
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:36,171
we transfer Yuwei back to bluesky kindergarten

604
00:38:36,425 --> 00:38:38,400
So we still need to transfer Yuwei to another kindergarten?

605
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,480
No matter what, we must transfer

606
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,639
Whatever

607
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:43,119
I am out of this

608
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,280
She wastes money

609
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,320
You should stop her

610
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,079
What does this mean?

611
00:39:11,719 --> 00:39:12,880
What does she want?

612
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:19,599
Yang

613
00:39:20,225 --> 00:39:22,079
You should sleep in the room

614
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:23,280
I will sleep on the sofa

615
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:23,679
It's ok, mom

616
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:24,239
I will sleep here

617
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,559
Bloody wife

618
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:28,599
So ridiculous

619
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,079
It's ok, mom

620
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:30,880
Let me tell you

621
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,480
You can't lower your head first this time

622
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,039
Ok...

623
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:34,400
You can't spoil her

624
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,360
Go to sleep, mom

625
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:36,840
Ridiculous

626
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,000
Good night

627
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,599
How's it?  Do you like it?

628
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,159
Brother, sister, look

629
00:40:45,575 --> 00:40:48,480
Many clients want to see the house

630
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,800
You should buy it now, don't hesitate

631
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:52,920
Ok, we need to take a look

632
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,079
Ok

633
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:18,800
We need to discuss about it

634
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,639
OK...

635
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,639
How's it?

636
00:41:31,719 --> 00:41:32,840
We will buy it

637
00:41:33,775 --> 00:41:36,239
I have considered this for a long time

638
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:39,559
I checked its real picture, floor plan

639
00:41:39,559 --> 00:41:41,800
and panoramic video in VR

640
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,725
I like the location and direction

641
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,039
And the decoration is not bad

642
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:49,079
We just need some furniture

643
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,039
Then we can get married directly

644
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:52,760
Get married?

645
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:53,559
Yes

646
00:41:53,559 --> 00:41:54,920
We can afford it

647
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,400
Wait...

648
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:59,000
I can't catch up with you

649
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:00,679
You have any plans?

650
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:02,039
I need to get mentally prepared

651
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:02,719
No more

652
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,320
Only buy a house

653
00:42:05,719 --> 00:42:07,519
Buying a house is a lifelong event

654
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:08,880
We need to be deliberative

655
00:42:09,079 --> 00:42:11,239
Yes, I am

656
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:11,800
I...

657
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:13,559
I'm discussing with you

658
00:42:13,559 --> 00:42:17,925
Tell me your opinion about it

659
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:20,159
Nothing special

660
00:42:20,679 --> 00:42:22,280
But maybe we will find a better one

661
00:42:25,025 --> 00:42:28,639
Siyu, there is no perfect house in the world

662
00:42:30,975 --> 00:42:34,199
It's our home when we move in

663
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,559
I think that is the best

664
00:42:39,039 --> 00:42:40,559
You are right

665
00:42:41,675 --> 00:42:44,519
But I want to see more

666
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:46,639
I don't want to

667
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:48,079
Just this one

668
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:49,719
I really don't want to see more

669
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,519
Don't be so impatient

670
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:52,800
I am impatient

671
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:53,840
I'm so anxious

672
00:42:54,175 --> 00:42:56,360
I want to buy the house

673
00:42:56,519 --> 00:42:57,719
Then I can marry you

674
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:07,920
Why?

675
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:09,400
You change your mind?

676
00:43:10,039 --> 00:43:11,199
You don't want to marry me?

677
00:43:11,199 --> 00:43:12,880
No, no, absolutely no

678
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:17,280
Why are you so picky when it comes to buying a house?

679
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:20,239
I'm not picky

680
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:24,960
Let me think about it

681
00:43:25,559 --> 00:43:26,320
Let me think about it

682
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,239
Brother Yang

683
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,559
Siyu, I just want to tell you

684
00:43:47,559 --> 00:43:48,519
Lubao is shortlisted

685
00:43:48,719 --> 00:43:50,680
Qualification  certification and sample testing are ok

686
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:52,079
Great

687
00:43:55,176 --> 00:43:56,920
Prepare for the bidding documents

688
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:57,880
No problem

689
00:43:58,150 --> 00:44:00,320
Next, expert team will intervene for evaluation 

690
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:01,559
We just assist them

691
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:04,960
To avoid suspicion, we can't see each other

692
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:05,800
Don't contact each other

693
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,280
I know

694
00:44:08,199 --> 00:44:08,920
Brother Yang

695
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,150
But can you tell me

696
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:15,575
What's our odds?

697
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,159
The only thing I can tell you is

698
00:44:18,199 --> 00:44:19,719
Lubao's score is pretty high

699
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:20,440
Good luck

700
00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:21,760
Thank you

701
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:39,599
Angry?

702
00:44:41,719 --> 00:44:42,480
No

703
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,360
Still deny it

704
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:46,440
You sound so indifferent

705
00:44:50,199 --> 00:44:51,000
I'm sorry

706
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,199
Ok?

707
00:44:52,599 --> 00:44:54,119
I want to get married

708
00:44:55,525 --> 00:44:57,960
I have pressure recently

709
00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:00,637
I need to make five hundred million

710
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:02,639
Also, you just went to the new company

711
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:07,050
I just can't concentrate on marriage

712
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,000
Since you are sincere

713
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,239
I'm ok now

714
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:16,960
Ok

715
00:45:36,199 --> 00:45:37,480
Mr. Chen?

716
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:38,239
Yes, it's me

717
00:45:38,239 --> 00:45:38,920
I made an appointment before

718
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:39,800
Come in, please
