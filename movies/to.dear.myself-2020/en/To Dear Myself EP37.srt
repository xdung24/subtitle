# Google translate version for your reference #

2
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:52,879
Don't you all say it's busy?

3
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,640
Why did not I see

4
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,719
Someone is working

5
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,439
Everyone is reserving energy

6
00:01:58,599 --> 00:01:59,640
Busy at the end of the year

7
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:06,239
Next year that

8
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:07,519
Scenic work plan

9
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:08,280
Who will do it

10
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:15,639
Li Siyu

11
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,240
Next year's plan

12
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,199
It's up to you to draft

13
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:21,240
Take advantage of this opportunity

14
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,199
Get acquainted

15
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:22,960
Work at hand

16
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,879
Why don't you answer my call

17
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,199
You didn't answer my call

18
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,560
You are still working for

19
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,560
Blame me for the heavy rain that day

20
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:57,840
You don't know

21
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,240
I every night

22
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,560
Fall asleep on time at a quarter past ten

23
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:02,159
Phone will also shut down

24
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,840
Yes, your life is extremely regular

25
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,680
Thunderous

26
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:08,039
But you are my boyfriend

27
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:09,439
Have you ever thought

28
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,319
What might happen that day

29
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,479
Unexpected things

30
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:12,639
Have you ever thought

31
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:13,719
I might be scared

32
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,080
That evening

33
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,240
When a thunderstorm occurs

34
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,599
I'm asleep

35
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:20,680
Not to mention when people fall asleep

36
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,520
Brain activity

37
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:23,759
Still unsolved mystery

38
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:25,240
You have a point

39
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,280
But in my opinion

40
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,759
There is only one explanation

41
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,840
You don't care about me

42
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,719
So you don't care about me

43
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:34,520
I have no weight in your heart

44
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,599
This is wrong

45
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,800
I have determined

46
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,879
You are my life partner

47
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,680
This is enough to explain

48
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,719
Your weight in my heart

49
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,840
But when I need it most

50
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,000
I can't get through your phone

51
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:48,599
this problem

52
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,400
I already have a solution

53
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:54,280
I gave you a cell phone

54
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,879
every night

55
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,520
10:15 Separate Machine

56
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:59,360
Shut down at 5:30 in the morning

57
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,199
This is the phone number

58
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,759
only you know

59
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:07,080
But what I want to remind you is

60
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:08,280
This call

61
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:09,840
Only occurs above level 5

62
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,120
In critical situations

63
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,080
Can call

64
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:13,680

Critical situation above grade 5

66
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,000
According to your daily life

67
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,519
Possible unexpected situation

68
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,759
According to criticality

69
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,600
Made a table

70
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,839
And divided into levels

71
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,839
The situation that day

72
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:25,199
Belongs to the sixth level

73
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:27,000
Can call

Can we go eat

77
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:42,519

00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:46,120
According to the overall ranking

00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,920
The scoring situation with the gourmet king

81
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:49,199
I found you a restaurant

82
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,839
You should like it

83
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,079
I'm still quite romantic, right

84
00:04:58,319 --> 00:04:59,519
So romantic

85
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:19,639
Yuwei, come on

86
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:20,120
mom

87
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:20,920
Come, Yuwei

88
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:22,519
Teacher, sorry

89
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,319
it does not matter

90
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,120
Delayed your get off work

91
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:24,759
it's okay no problem

92
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,199
Say goodbye

93
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,920
Goodbye susan

94
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,319
Goodbye Yuwei

95
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:31,920
Goodbye teacher li

96
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,759
Bye bye Yuwei

97
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:33,519
Gone, bye

98
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:35,160
Goodbye

99
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:35,680
Ok

100
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:43,600
It's okay

101
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,800
Dad will pick you up in a while

102
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:46,639
Then play yours

103
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,199
Come, Yuwei

104
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:01,360
teacher

105
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,800
Susan's mother hasn't come to pick her up yet

106
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:04,920
Still not here

107
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:05,800
Her father made a call

108
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,680
Said it was temporary

109
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,120
Maybe a little later

110
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,519
Are you okay?

111
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:13,120
My husband is on a business trip

112
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,800
Then the child is at home alone

113
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:15,680
I am a bit

114
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,839
A little worried about him

115
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,279
How about this

116
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,680
I happen to take Yuwei

117
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,279
Go to the fast food restaurant

118
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,120
You call Susan's father

119
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,399
If he agrees

120
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:26,720
I took Susan with me

121
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:27,800
Let her father

122
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,879
Just pick her up nearby

123
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,560
That's too much trouble for you

124
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,199
Nothing

125
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,360
Susan, come on

126
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:36,879
I'll call now

127
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:38,040
come on

128
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:47,319
Guoguo, I'm here to play with you

129
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,000
father

130
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:52,240
Susan miss dad?

131
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:53,040
miss you

132
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,600
kiss Me

133
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:54,480
Thank you

134
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,519
Yu Wei

135
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,360
Come

136
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,319
It is you

137
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,680
What a coincidence

138
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:10,319
I'll treat this meal today

139
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:11,480
No need to

140
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:13,040
I have already paid

141
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,600
Then next time I invite

142
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:19,240
Haven't eaten tonight?

143
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,879
Didn't eat yet? Just after the meeting

144
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,759
I ordered a lot today

145
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,120
Do you want to sit down and eat

146
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:28,959
You're welcome

147
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:31,879
What do you want to drink

148
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,439
A cup of hot American

149
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:35,959
Drinking coffee so late

150
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:37,000
Can't sleep

151
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:37,879
Go back in a while

152
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:38,920
There is still work to be done

153
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,360
So hard

154
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,120
Now you say

155
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:44,519
Who doesn't work hard

156
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,480
I will buy coffee for you

157
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,720
Um thanks

158
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,079
Yu Wei

159
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,800
Hello, a cup of hot American

160
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:56,120
What are you doing

161
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,040
What to take

162
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,639
We are taking almond's home

163
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,519
This is a home, right

164
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:04,399
Haven't eaten enough, Susan

165
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:05,120
I am full

166
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:05,920
Do you want to eat more

167
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:09,720
Yes yes yes

168
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,839
Yes this

169
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,839
Be careful, be careful

170
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:12,680
Fell down for a while.

171
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:14,920
mom

172
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,600
Susan and I went to the children's playground

173
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,360
Go

174
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:19,639
Be safe and don't fall

175
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:20,079
Ok

176
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:20,759
Slow down

177
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:31,199
thank you

178
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,720
Mother Yuwei

179
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,279
What happened before

180
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:49,360
My attitude is not very good

181
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:50,720
Sorry

182
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:53,840
It's okay to do sales

183
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,240
It's all commonplace

184
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:55,879
Ok

185
00:08:58,519 --> 00:08:59,440
but

186
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,720
You said

187
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,960
I always have a doubt

188
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,200
Our company's products are also good

189
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:06,679
I am in sales

190
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,039
Also took a lot of thought

191
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,000
Why is

192
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,279
Can't get into your eyes

193
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:16,000
What about your emerald products

194
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,639
not bad

195
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,240
Just your emerald people

196
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,080
Am I not doing well?

197
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,759
Don't don't you misunderstand

198
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:25,799
I'm not talking about you

199
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,480
I docked with me before

200
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,360
That salesman

201
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:30,960
This person

202
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,399
Too bad faith

203
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,639
I am very very disdainful

204
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:39,559
You mean

205
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:40,960
Before me and her

206
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,919
Talked about a small list

207
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:44,399
What about my colleagues later

208
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,240
I found out during the contract review

209
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,519
Contract that requires a seal

210
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,600
Before us

211
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:52,159
Confirmed version

212
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,759
Is totally different

213
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:56,080
As long as this chapter goes on

214
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:57,799
Our company paid more than 100,000 yuan

215
00:09:58,679 --> 00:09:59,759
There will be such a thing

216
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,039
For our company

217
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,519
Pay more than 100,000

218
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:05,960
Not a big number

219
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,600
But this low-level method

220
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,879
I can't stand it, can't tolerate it

221
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,559
I would rather you take everything

222
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,759
All on the table to talk

223
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:12,960
right

224
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,840
It's okay if you add money

225
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,600
I did sales very late

226
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,759
You are my visit

227
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:19,759
First customer

228
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:21,519
I am about the previous

229
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:22,639
Not very clear

230
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:25,039
is it possible

231
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,960
Is my former sales colleague

232
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,200
She didn't mean it

233
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,519
She just accidentally

234
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,120
Got this data wrong

235
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:32,159
What about her

236
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,519
That's what you told me

237
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,519
But it doesn't matter

238
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:37,159
I said that

239
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:38,159
I can't accept this behavior

240
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:38,840
Can't tolerate

241
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,639
Then terminate the contract

242
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,200
But you don't know your colleague

243
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:47,200
What did later

244
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:50,480
She started making my rumors outside

245
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,000
Say why she

246
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,080
Can't sign this order

247
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,039
Because I accepted

248
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:55,399
Money from other battery companies

249
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:56,480
That's why I didn't sign with her

250
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,799
How could she do this

251
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,080
She did it

252
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:00,799
Too much

253
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:02,320
Fortunately my leader

254
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,720
I still believe in me

255
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,759
Otherwise, I'm Su Lixing

256
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,679
Principles that have been adhered to for so many years

257
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:09,200
And the accumulated reputation

258
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:10,440
Not all ruined

259
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,399
Did she put her mouth on one?

260
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,960
This is too much

261
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:19,240
So when you came before

262
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,919
Just caught up with me

263
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,080
I understand

264
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:27,240
You are you she is her

265
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,360
I shouldn't be angry

266
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,320
Sprinkle on your head

267
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:31,399
This is very rude

268
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:32,799
I

269
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:34,360
Apologize to you again

270
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:35,519
No no no

271
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:37,399
I should apologize to you

272
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:39,039
As a member of Emerald

273
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,080
I should act for my colleague

274
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,600
I'm sorry to tell you

275
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:44,159
It has nothing to do with you

276
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,960
Mr. Su

277
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:48,399
I think i should

278
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,519
Take this matter

279
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:50,960
Report to our manager

280
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,519
Because of this

281
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,360
It’s not just you that hurt

282
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,840
Also our green treasure

283
00:11:59,279 --> 00:11:59,759
It looks like

284
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:01,039
You pretty much protect your emerald

285
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,840
Although the damaging horse

286
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,080
But our company

287
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,159
Most employees

288
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:08,600
And our company's products

289
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:10,039
Are still excellent

290
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,960
Can you think about it again

291
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:17,559
next year

292
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:19,559
This year's purchase is over

293
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:21,240
Understand more

294
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,480
next year

295
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,120
Nana

296
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:34,559
Ok

297
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,519
Trouble you

298
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,039
Marketing strategy this year

299
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:37,720
market expansion

300
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,639
There are price plans

301
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,120
tomorrow

302
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,799
You said yesterday

303
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:48,679
Then tomorrow

304
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:53,799
Brother Zhai

305
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:05,559
how

306
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,919
Thought in front of the boss

307
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:08,960
Hit me small report

308
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,000
Can sit in my place

309
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,639
Ignore him, it's okay

310
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:15,360
Boss met me

311
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,840
You have to call Brother Zhai

312
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:18,559
A new one

313
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:20,480
I don't know how high the sky is

314
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:22,720
Actually challenged me

315
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,399
He berated me

316
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,919
The more you care about him, the more angry he gets

317
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:28,200
Stop talking, ignore him

318
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,720
I provoke him

319
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:30,679
do not

320
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,279
Who will get the takeaway?

321
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,840
That just came

322
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:35,360
You go get it

323
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:37,399
I'll buy you milk tea

324
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,799
It's okay, okay, go quickly

325
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:40,639
Thank you

326
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,759
What did you want yesterday

327
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:45,080
Marketing Channel Network Platform

328
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,000
Customer profile data

329
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,440
To tear through Lao Zhai's tricks

330
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,440
Lao Zhai said he was going to inspect

331
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,480
Actually go to play mahjong

332
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,200
Let Manager Feng know

333
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,360
Don't fine any money

334
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,440
So Lao Zhai angered you

335
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:57,960
Then why are you

336
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,000
Don't let me go back

337
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,320
Lao Zhai has no grudges

338
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,279
You let him say a few words

339
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:03,240
It's over

340
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,639
Then you have to go back

341
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:05,799
Small things become big things

342
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:06,840
Where in the future

343
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:08,519
This is clearly

344
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:09,919
He doesn't make sense

345
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:12,000
Not a kid

346
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,159
Everything has to be reasonable

347
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,879
I think

348
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,440
Everyone's attitude towards me

349
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,320
All weird

350
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,159
As if i offended someone

351
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,600
That's not it

352
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:27,559
Mainly this work plan

353
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:28,759
Why are you so serious

354
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,600
Want this and that

355
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,720
Take the whole office

356
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,759
Uneasy

357
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:36,399
But Manager Feng told me

358
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,039
I can't just perfunctory

359
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,600
Do you want to make enemies?

360
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,039
I do not want

361
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,159
But leave it to me

362
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,919
I can't neglect

363
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,480
Then you have to

364
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,960
Slowly change your character

365
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:56,080
Let me try

366
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:57,080
Ok

367
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:58,240
Where i am

368
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,320
Have last year's work plan

369
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,600
You take it and modify it slightly

370
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,480
Hand it in

371
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,759
really

372
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,600
I just learned

373
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,919
His daughter and my daughter

374
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:12,279
Is a good friend of kindergarten

375
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:17,440
Let me deal with this problem

376
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,399
Stop telling others

377
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,399
correct

378
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:24,279
Siyu's new company

379
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,120
collapsed

380
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:28,440
Yes

381
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,519
I call her cellphone

382
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,240
Always shut down

383
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,240
She's back home

384
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,840
Previous phone number

385
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,639
Not much use anymore

386
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:44,240
it's a pity

387
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,279
I'll go out first

388
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:53,919
Zhizhi

389
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,320
Congratulations

390
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:56,360
Got it this month

391
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,240
Most Progress Award

392
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,360
Keep going

393
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:01,799
Thank you Mr. Yuan

394
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,600
I am back

395
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:29,879
came back

396
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,480
time to eat

397
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:32,879
it is good

398
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:33,679
Siyu is back

399
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,240
Got angry in the unit

400
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:46,840
How do you know

401
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,759
I don't know, guessing

402
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:56,639
I tell you

403
00:16:57,399 --> 00:16:58,440
Your aunt

404
00:16:58,759 --> 00:17:00,720
I want to introduce you a boyfriend

405
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,679
At home today

406
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,480
Made a phone call

407
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,279
Then why don't you stop her?

408
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,960
Why should i stop her

409
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,880
I didn't stop you from falling in love

410
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,720
right

411
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,880
Are now older leftover women

412
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,920
What reason do i stop

413
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,119
Xiaoling is the one who fell in love with me, not me

414
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,720
Xiaoling

415
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,799
Don't you say

416
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:26,119
Xiaoling is better than you in this respect

417
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:28,400
dad

418
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,880
What are you father and daughter talking about

419
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:32,599
Talk about boyfriend

420
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,960
Since you all talked up here

421
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:40,079
Siyu, Auntie wants to persuade you

422
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,160
The past is over

423
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:43,400
You are not young anymore

424
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,599
Hurry up

425
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:46,200
I know

426
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,680
Those friends around me

427
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,799
Daughter as old as you

428
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,240
Their children are in elementary school

429
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:52,759
Us

430
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,680
Even if you don't worry about getting married

431
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,759
Also have to talk about one first

432
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,599
dont you agree

433
00:17:57,799 --> 00:17:58,680
Yes yes yes

434
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,559
Aunt Luo

435
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:04,920
Introduced you one

436
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,400
The guy from the design institute

437
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,319
Family conditions are pretty good

438
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:10,720
Take time to meet you

439
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,799
Auntie, I just went to work

440
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:14,680
Busy

441
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,160
Wait two days

442
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:16,920
No no no

443
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,680
You can delay the day

444
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,119
Not so much

445
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,319
Obedient obedient

446
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,799
Be that Aunt Luo

447
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:24,960
Give her a face

448
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,839
Who is Aunt Luo?

449
00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:31,359
Aunt Luo, don't you know

450
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:34,200
Your child in the future

451
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:35,799
If you go to a good school

452
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,799
That can be all pointed

453
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,200
Aunt Luo helped

454
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,759
Don't copy it all

455
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,400
Data wording

456
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,599
Slightly modified

457
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,759
Answering reasoning

458
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:28,079
Answering reasoning

459
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,799
Take care of me

460
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:32,359
I beg, I'm going crazy

461
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,839
At least let me confirm

462
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:34,880
Your life and death

463
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,759

I really envy you

473
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:10,799
How are you

474
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,000
Your mom has started

He Mu's business

480
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,160
She annoyed me for three days

481
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:27,680
Such a big thing

482
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,759
You don't tell your mother

483
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,640
I didn't think about it myself

484
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,960
What did i tell her

485
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,160
You haven't thought about it

486
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,359
It's OK, don't talk about me

487
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,759
How are you

00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:38,720
Are you still used to going back?

Go ahead

553
00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:30,079
Li Siyu

554
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:31,359
You don't remember me anymore

555
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,480
Small news

556
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:40,559
My features

557
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,240
It's really not easy to remember

558
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,440
Nor is it

559
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:52,440
I left Shanghai six months ago

560
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:54,960
You also came back from shanghai

561
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,720
Why leave shanghai

562
00:24:58,319 --> 00:24:59,880
Dislike not used to

But i don't like myself there

567
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,079
What does this mean

568
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:15,079
I really have something to do today

569
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,640
How about we make an appointment another day

570
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,759

579
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:52,400
Sorry

580
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:54,039
It's ok

581
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,720
Where did I go anyway

582
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,519

Try again

584
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,000
Why can't it open?

585
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,319
Didn't you say you remembered you

586
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:04,720
What is after 179

587
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:06,359
Dad, mom, really

00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,200
I did not put the password

589
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,079
Did you send it to you?

590
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:09,119
Why are you still at the door

591
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:10,119
Your dad didn't remember

592
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:10,759
Come come here i come

593
00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:11,480
Old age

594
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,240
Watch and remember

595
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:19,559
791

596
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:20,519
You said you guys are too

597
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:21,640
Don't tell me in advance

598
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,880
I'll pick you up at the station

599
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,319
Just don't want to trouble you

600
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:25,680
So I didn't tell you in advance

601
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:26,960
Know the address

602
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,480
Just come by your own car

603
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:32,839
Son, you don't live here

604
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:34,680
I worked overtime these two days

605
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:36,359
This is

606
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:37,759
The house you bought for five million

607
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,119
Yes

608
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:41,920
This must be in my hometown

609
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,400
Can buy two villas

610
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,000
Dad, this is Shanghai

611
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,319
Yiming

612
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,559
House prices in Shanghai will not fall

613
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:51,440
How can Shanghai's house prices fall

614
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,039
Okay, this house

615
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:07,960
Ok

616
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,119
I called your company

617
00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:13,720
The company said you stopped doing it long ago

618
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:15,799
why

619
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:18,559
Do you have a job now

620
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,759
I have it now

621
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:21,000
Me and my friend

622
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,039
Closed a company

623
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,880
Can it work

624
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,279
Yes of course

625
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,000
We have found the investment

626
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,920
Then the company is on track

627
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,079
Then you and Siyu

628
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:33,559
There is no way to save it

629
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,799
We come this time

630
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:39,240
I also want to help you and Siyu

631
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:40,359
Have a good talk

632
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,599
I already have a new girlfriend

633
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,079
Then your new girlfriend

634
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:50,119
What is it for

635
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,559
Financial

636
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:54,480
Financial

637
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,279
Economic conditions are OK

638
00:27:57,359 --> 00:27:58,119
Really good

639
00:27:58,119 --> 00:27:58,960
Anyway better than me

640
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,559
Where is her home

641
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:02,759
I really don't know this

642
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:04,119
how old are you

643
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:07,160
just like

644
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,119
Seems to be a bit older than me

645
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,359
How big

646
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,599
Where do i know where to go

647
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,640
I didn't ask so clearly

648
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:18,160
Such an important thing

649
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,000
You don't even know

650
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,839
Are you deceived by her?

651
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:22,119
No mom

652
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:22,920
How old am i

653
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,839
Why am I being deceived

654
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:24,519
You are for her

655
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:25,799
Did you break up with Siyu?

656
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:28,839
Is not

657
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:31,039
I broke up with Siyu

658
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:33,240
It's our two own reasons

659
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,160
That's because of her

660
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:35,920
Lost your original job

661
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:36,960
Things at work

662
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,119
It's my decision

663
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,720
Let's meet that person

664
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:03,359
Come mom

665
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:04,720
Drink some hot water

666
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,200
Ok

667
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:05,920
Be careful

668
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,480
it is good

669
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,079
We want to meet your girlfriend

670
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:11,920
No need

671
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,759
Needed

672
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,240
No this time

673
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,200
Mainly came too anxious

674
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:15,960
Or next time, next time I

675
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,599
Just this time

676
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:24,599
Row

677
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,519
Let me check the time

678
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,359
Dad, auntie, I'm back

679
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:33,440
Siyu, have you eaten yet?

680
00:29:33,559 --> 00:29:34,319
Nope

681
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:51,640
Sit down

682
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,799
how do you feel

683
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,119
I need to ask

684
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,079
Came back without eating

685
00:29:59,079 --> 00:30:00,039
Definitely not feeling it

686
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,000
I didn't ask you, I asked Siyu

687
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,559
no feelings

688
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,039
Such good conditions

689
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,400
You don't feel it

690
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
What condition

691
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,400
Aunt Nalu said

692
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,759
Before this little news comes back

693
00:30:12,759 --> 00:30:14,359
Sold a house in Shanghai

694
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:16,680
Worth millions

695
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:18,519
Millions

696
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:19,720
You sell your sons and daughters

697
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,720
Even if we want to sell our daughter

698
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,200
How can it be hundreds of millions?

699
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:28,720
Don't listen to your dad, listen to me

700
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,960
Get in with that little smell

701
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,480
forget it

702
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:35,160
Don't count

703
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,640
You have to marry in your life

704
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,240
You are over thirty

705
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:41,680
This is your last chance

706
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:44,000
Why do you say that

707
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,480
Your value is starting to fall

708
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:48,799
The 30-year-old guy

709
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,160
So popular

710
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:51,839
Just started to pull up

711
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:54,319
Auntie, what is your theory?

712
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,759
I'm for your good

713
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:00,200
Auntie, don’t lose it

714
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:02,960
talk later

715
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,039
Too urgent

716
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,759
Time is not enough

717
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,920
I need before the end of the year

718
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,039
The brand value of Emerald

719
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:12,960
Tenfold

720
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,759
Contacted several companies

721
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,359
They all retreated

722
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,160
what happened

723
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:29,680
Nothing

724
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,319
Yiming

725
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,799
I desperately need to reverse

726
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:35,920
Emerald's unprofitable situation

727
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,839
I wonder if I have any friends

728
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:42,680
Can recommend

729
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,720
You can recommend Yiwen Company

730
00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:47,680
Forgive me

731
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:06,799
Do you want some soup

732
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:07,759
I will help you Sheng

733
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:08,960
Let auntie go

734
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:09,960
No, I'll come here

735
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,039
Let me do it

736
00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:46,200
Come

737
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:46,759
Ok

738
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,759
My parents are here

739
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:19,160
They want to see you

740
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:25,880
Why are you laughing

741
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,400
I just suddenly felt

742
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,400
So real

743
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,680
Isn't it true between us

744
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,200
do not mean that

745
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:44,279
I mean

746
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,119
Suddenly feel

747
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,119
Chai, rice, oil and salt are so close to me

748
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:00,960
tomorrow I will

749
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:02,839
May have to travel

750
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,239
You just thought about going on a business trip

751
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:15,639
Do you think

752
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,800
It's not appropriate at this time

753
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,159
I don't think it is necessary

754
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,440
Do you think it is unnecessary now

755
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,159
Still not necessary in the future

756
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,920
Feelings are our business

757
00:34:32,518 --> 00:34:34,479
Has nothing to do with other people

758
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:36,400
They they are not

759
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,360
Anyone else

760
00:34:38,039 --> 00:34:39,119
They are my parents

761
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,159
Yiming

762
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:47,960
Recently

763
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,920
You have an excuse to work overtime

764
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,800
did not return

765
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,159
Do you think i'm out of ideas

766
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:02,280
But I didn’t ask, right?

767
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,679
Because i believe

768
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:08,000
Your loyalty to feelings

769
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,519
I also allow

770
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:12,280
You have your own private space

771
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:15,599
So i hope you are the same

772
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,599
You can also respect my ideas

773
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,440
I only love you

774
00:35:21,639 --> 00:35:23,239
Just want to be with you

775
00:35:25,639 --> 00:35:26,639
What do you think

776
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,679
Our relationship

777
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:32,039
What is the final attribution

778
00:35:34,679 --> 00:35:36,079
I haven't thought about this

779
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,280
You never thought about our future

780
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:43,639
We are together now

781
00:35:43,639 --> 00:35:44,360
Very happy

782
00:35:44,679 --> 00:35:45,679
Why do you want so much

783
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:47,280
If i want

784
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,840
It's not just happiness now

785
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,320
What else do you want

786
00:35:52,679 --> 00:35:54,199
Although we are just together

787
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,800
But what I want is responsibility

788
00:35:58,639 --> 00:35:59,480
Is guardian

789

For a lifetime

790
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:10,039
I may not be able to give you these

791
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:18,199
Can i understand

792
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:21,199
You actually just want

793
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:22,239
Have a love with me

794
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:23,920
Don't want to participate in my life

795
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,960
Don't want me

796
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,960
Participate in your life

797
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:38,719
Yiming

798
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,199
Yiming

799
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:48,400
You say i am your angel

800
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,559
But do you know

801
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,880
Angel round investment failure rate

802
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,079
Is 95%

803
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:58,920
I said I don't want to participate too much

804
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:00,559
Because of

805
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,159
If one day

806
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:02,800
I have to

807
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,079
When facing failure

808
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,119
I can just explain to myself

809
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,280
No need to tell anyone else

810
00:37:42,519 --> 00:37:43,159
and many more

811
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,679
Wait, wait, wait

812
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:46,119
No regrets

813
00:37:46,679 --> 00:37:47,760
I am your father

814
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,599
That's not OK

815
00:37:50,039 --> 00:37:51,679
Why are you so serious about playing chess?

816
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:54,039
It's your turn

817
00:37:56,679 --> 00:37:58,400
What did you two do

818
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,880
The phone rang and did not answer

819
00:38:00,039 --> 00:38:00,920
Don't bother

820
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:01,800
Hey

821
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,480
Who

822
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,559
Is it a little smell

823
00:38:06,199 --> 00:38:08,119
She's free

824
00:38:09,239 --> 00:38:11,000
You come pick her up now

825
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,280
Good good

826
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,840
Goodbye

827
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,639
Who

828
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,920
It's Xiao Wen

829
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:19,760
He asked you out

830
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,119
I do not want to go

831
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,239
I can agree

832
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,480
He will be there soon

833
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:25,440
I want to play chess with my dad

834
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:26,840
Play chess with your dad

835
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,880
What's the point

836
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:28,840
Laohuiqi

837
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,880
You regret playing chess

838
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,760
Be good, go and change clothes

839
00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:33,599
Obediently

840
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:35,320
obedient

841
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:43,440
See who's here

842
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:44,599
Yu Wei

843
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,119
Susan

844
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:47,480
early

845
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,480
Come here, dad

846
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,199
Come here to pick her up tonight

847
00:38:56,199 --> 00:38:57,920
My business trip is postponed to next week

848
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,400
I promised Susan before

849
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,239
Said to go to Disney

850
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,519
I don't want her to be disappointed

851
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:03,800
and so

852
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,199
I'll accompany you

853
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:08,840
Okay

854
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,119
boarding

855
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,400
Go to Disney

856
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,480
Let's go let's go

857
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:27,079
Super him

858
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,679
Drive

859
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,320
Safety first

860
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,400
I drive

861
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,480
Safe driving

862
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:45,840
what did you say

863
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:49,159
What i plan is

864
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:51,440
Have a child after three or five years

865
00:39:52,039 --> 00:39:53,159
Change to the travel version

866
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,400
Good to take the kids

867
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,519
Travel or something

868
00:39:58,519 --> 00:39:59,599
You think so far

869
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,440
Three to five years are not far away

870
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,440
Life goes fast

871
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,159
Arrived

872
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:18,519
Two tigers love to dance

873
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:22,760
The little rabbit pulls the radish obediently

874
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:27,199
I learn to walk

875
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:28,639
You see

876
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:30,119
The tallest building

877
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:31,360
Is Shanghai Center

878
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:32,559
Is that one?

879
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:33,920
Shanghai Center

880
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:35,840
The second highest one is

881
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,440
World Financial Center

882
00:40:37,639 --> 00:40:40,079
World Financial Center

883
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:40,800
Correct

884
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,519
There is another building next to it

885
00:40:42,519 --> 00:40:43,800
Slightly shorter

886
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,639
That is Jin Mao Tower

887
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,760
Jin Mao Building

888
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,079
Yes smart

889
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,639
Little duck

890
00:40:56,119 --> 00:40:57,519
Ducks where are ducks

891
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,000
That is swan

892
00:40:59,000 --> 00:40:59,760
let me see

893
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:03,400
I know the story of the ugly duckling

894
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:05,400
Tell me one

895
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,760
I beg you

896
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:09,119
Ok i will tell you

897
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,639
a long long time ago

898
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,960
There is a female duck

899
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:22,519
Why are you bringing me here

900
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:24,840
This is my parents

901
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:25,920
Wedding room for me

902
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,920
The room payment was paid in full

903
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:30,639
The decoration money is ready

904
00:41:30,679 --> 00:41:32,280
Just wait for the lady to decide on the decoration style

905
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,480
Let's not reach this point yet

906
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:35,840
Yes

907
00:41:36,199 --> 00:41:37,320
I just want to use this way

908
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,119
Tell you

909
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:39,480
I'm not the kind of unreliable person

910
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,400
I went to get married with you

911
00:41:42,519 --> 00:41:43,960
If we get married

912
00:41:44,199 --> 00:41:44,800
Economically

913
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,079
You don't have to worry about the future

914
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,119
correct

915
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:48,480
Our home is in Jinye Square

916
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,079
There are two pavements

917
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,599
My mom said

918
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:52,800
The rent for those two shops

919
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,280
Will be used by children in the future

920
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,119
No longer have to be afraid

921
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:56,119
The landlord has increased the price

922
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,280
No need to worry anymore

923
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,519
The landlord is going to sell the house

924
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:02,079
Since then became a house slave

925
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:04,440
Finally became a house slave

926
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,440
I

927
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,559
I have a crush on you since the first grade

928
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:21,079
what did you say

929
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:24,440
Since I saw you last time

930
00:42:24,679 --> 00:42:25,719
Know you are still single

931
00:42:26,199 --> 00:42:27,079
I can't wait

932
00:42:27,079 --> 00:42:28,159
Auntie Luo

933
00:42:28,159 --> 00:42:29,559
Let her introduce you to me

934
00:42:31,719 --> 00:42:32,679
Turned out to be like this

935
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:46,239
Siyu

936
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:49,679
Although you don't say anything

937
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,639
But i can feel

938
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,960
You must be injured in Shanghai

939
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,079
I can assure you

940
00:42:59,719 --> 00:43:01,079
As long as you stay with me

941
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:03,159
I will never hurt you

942
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:06,400
you know

943
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,920
Why do people get hurt

944
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:09,840
Because I met a bad guy

945
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:12,199
Do not

946
00:43:13,039 --> 00:43:15,519
Be hurt because of love

947
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,920
If you don't want to be hurt

948
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,519
Just not love

949
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:22,960
But can we do it

950
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:26,400
I can not do it

951
00:43:27,159 --> 00:43:28,199
I can't do it

952
00:43:29,639 --> 00:43:30,559
so

953
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,079
As long as we still have the instinct of love

954
00:43:34,239 --> 00:43:35,800
You have to face the hurt

955
00:43:40,039 --> 00:43:40,840
How do i have a

956
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:41,880
Ominous premonition

957
00:43:44,719 --> 00:43:45,480
Small news

958
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,000
We still

959
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,320
Just be ordinary friends

960
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:51,039
you sure

961
00:43:51,639 --> 00:43:52,639
Very sure

962
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:56,679
be with you

963
00:43:57,559 --> 00:43:58,800
I won't feel tired

964
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,000
Won't hurt

965
00:44:02,679 --> 00:44:03,519
but

966
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:06,519
I think

967
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:10,199
Boring isn't it

968
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,199
or

969
00:44:15,639 --> 00:44:16,840
Let's go everywhere

970
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,559
Maybe you can find the feeling

971
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:21,440
Small news

972
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:23,920
Your conditions are good

973
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,639
Everyone advised me to cherish

974
00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:29,280
but

975
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,239
You are not what i want

976
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,239
What do you want

977
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:43,960
I still want that

978
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:45,039
The feeling of love

979
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,800
Even if it will hurt again
