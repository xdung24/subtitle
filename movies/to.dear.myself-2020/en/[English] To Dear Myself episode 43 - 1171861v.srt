00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,600
[Episode 43]

4
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,000
Xiaoling, I made plans with my boyfriend so I won't be going in the same direction as you. I'll see you tomorrow.

5
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,800
- Bye-bye. 
 - Bye—

6
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,600
You don't have dyslexia.

7
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,800
You have symptoms of procrastination.

8
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,500
And procrastination often arises from the conflict in one's heart.

9
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,400
You are not avoiding me either.

10
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,400
You are hinting to me

11
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,300
that you want to break up with me.

12
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,400
I—

13
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,000
Let me finish first. When I realized this,

14
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
my muscle began to tic.

15
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,800
My breath and pulse

16
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,600
are all a mess.

17
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,200
The dopamine level in my brain was far lower than the normal level.

18
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,600
This directly caused me to become sad.

19
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,800
At the same time, it caused me to not be able to focus my attention.

20
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,800
My cognitive function

21
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,000
and memory all started to degenerate.

22
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,200
I didn't do anything.

23
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,400
Xiaoling...

24
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,100
You didn't do anything indeed,

25
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:38,600
it is I who fell in love with you.

26
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,800
All of my physical reactions

27
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,400
perfectly match the

28
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,500
pathological conditions the humans exhibit when they are heartbroken.

29
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,000
Logically,

30
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,500
Gu Xiaoling, I love you.

31
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,600
No one has ever

32
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,300
confessed their love to me like this.

33
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,200
I reviewed our dating data again.

34
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,900
I found that...

35
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,800
the day when you told me that your sister urgently needed ¥5,000,000

36
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,000
and I immediately rejected was a critical point.

37
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,900
From then on, you started to avoid me.

38
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:25,790
I carefully recalled everything that I said that day.

39
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:30,250
From my point of view, everything I said was correct.

40
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,800
However, a relationship therapist told me that

41
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,800
there is no right or wrong in relationships.

42
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,200
Xiaoling,

43
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,800
here is ¥5,000,000. Please accept it.

44
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,200
No.

45
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:04,690
I feel like my actions right now are very stupid.

46
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:09,400
It doesn't correspond to the principles I use to act by.

47
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,000
It also violates several articles of our prenuptial agreement.

48
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,500
Nevertheless,

49
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,820
I'm willing to make an exception for you.

50
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,200
You don't need to do this.

51
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,700
Xiaoling,

52
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,600
I discovered a scary truth.

53
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,400
I cannot accept a future without you.

54
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,800
Thus, I must do this.

55
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,600
Please accept it.

Dubu has caused me to be exhausted. 
 (T/N: literal translation is my head and forehead are burned)

66
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,600
I didn't have time to care about you.

67
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,700

I don't know why, but now

74
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,400
I don't feel furious anymore.

75
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,200
How about her?

76
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,300
She apologized and repented to me.

77
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:17,420
You didn't forgive her just like that, did you?

78
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,890
I'm not that saintly.

79
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,200
I don't know why, but

80
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,600
when I see her try so hard to get on my good side

81
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,000
and her being so afraid, I pity her.

82
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I don't know why either.

83
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,600

I signed the prenuptial agreement.

92
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,700
What did you say?

93
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:28,400
I said I signed the prenuptial agreement!

94
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,400
You decided?

95
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,700
When I was eight years old, I already decided.

96
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,600
You don't love him at all!

97
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,300
You don't even like him!

98
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,800
But when I'm with him,

99
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,000
I can forever forget about that day.

100
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,800
Which day?

101
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,200
The second year after my dad died,

102
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,200
my mom brought me along to my uncle's to borrow money.

103
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,600
Then my mom had me wait for her at the door.

104
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,200
It was especially cold then.

105
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,200
It was snowing.

106
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,600
All the other kids are having snowball fights but I was there waiting and waiting.

107
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,200
Then they threw snowballs at me.

108
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,200
My clothes got all wet.

109
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,800
Then I blamed my mom.

110
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,800
Why didn't she let me wait inside my uncle's home?

111
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,900
It wasn't until later that I found out that

112
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,200
my mom didn't want me to see her cringingly beg people.

113
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:48,000
Then, was she able to borrow the money?

114
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,640
My mom wanted to borrow ¥2,000.

115
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,600
Then my uncle used ¥50 to dismiss her.

116
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,600
When my mom came out from his place,

117
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,800
her eyes were red.

118
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,100
I will never forget that moment.

119
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,600
Why haven't you told me this before?

120
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,600
From that moment, I knew that

121
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,700
there is nothing reliable in the world.

122
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,000
Brother Haowen has always liked you.

123
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,400
He Mu loves me a lot, too.

124
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:37,600
Then, who do you love? Who do you like?

125
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,630
Me?

126
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,600
I like money.

127
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,800
I want to live a stable

128
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:51,800
life where I don't need to worry about anything nor the future.

129
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:56,600
I like the feeling of buying whatever I want without checking the price tag.

130
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,400
Then, have you gotten what you wanted?

131
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,000
Yes!

132
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,200
So we should be happy!

133
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,000
Happy!

134
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,600
Xiaoling,

135
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,800
Lei Haowen has changed a lot lately.

136
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,200
I think you can try to see him from a different perspective.

137
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,400
- Maybe you will have another possible future— 
 - Stop trying to persuade me!

138
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,700
I don't want you to regret anything in the future.

139
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,000
No matter who I choose, there's a possibility that I'll regret it.

140
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,200
But at least I have money. I have money!

141
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,900
Here!

142
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,800
What's this?

143
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,800
He Mu gave me ¥5,000,000.

144
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,800
¥5,000,000!

145
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,400
Xiao Ling, thank you. I can't accept this money.

146
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,600
Take it.

147
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,600
Don't think I don't know.

148
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:07,400
Lately, you've been so worried, you can't even sleep.

149
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,400
We've already got enough money.

150
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,200
For now, the Dubu project doesn't need money.

151
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,800
Besides, even if I'm desperate,

152
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,300
I can't use your money.

153
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,300
Because I hope...

154
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,400
you can return this ¥5,000,000, without a penny missing,

155
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,200
to He Mu.

156
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,800
Li Siyu!

157
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,000
Why can't you just give me your blessing and congratulate me?!

158
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Why do you keep thinking of breaking He Mu and I up?

159
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,700
Xiao Ling!

160
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:52,430
We hope that you are happy.

161
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
We hope that you are blissful.

162
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I definitely will be!

163
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I definitely will be happy and blissful!

164
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,700
Come on!

165
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,300
Happy.

166
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,200
Blissful!

167
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,800
Blissful.

168
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,600
Blissful.

169
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,800
Hey, Lei Haowen,

170
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,400
where have you been?

171
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,200
I called you but you didn't answer. I messaged you and you didn't reply.

172
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,100
Director Gong and I waited here for you for a long time.

173
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,200
I'm about to go bankrupt.

174
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,300
What's going on?

175
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:18,200
Dozens of Dubu's experiments have

176
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,200
successively failed.

177
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:24,000
If we can't find an investor to put in money right now,

178
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:26,990
my house,

179
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,400
and Siyu's next ten years

180
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,600
will all be gone.

181
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,700
What should I do?

182
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,400
Haowen's here?

183
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,210
Director Gong?

184
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,400
Hey, Director Gong.

185
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,400
Why didn't I think of you?

186
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,400
Right now, I—

187
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,400
No, no need. Just tell me.

188
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,400
Right now, there's a great project.

189
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:02,200
It's almost complete but we just need some money. Would you be interested?

190
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,060
Sit down and tell me.

191
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,400
Dubu, Professor Gao Zhengdao's membrane-less battery.

192
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,000
If this project is successful,

193
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,200
then the world of new energy will be ours.

194
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,200
I'm at the club.

195
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,400
Okay. How about in 15 minutes?

196
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,200
Come pick me up.

197
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,600
President Wang.

198
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:43,000
They are willing to transfer another 20% of the shares for ¥10,000,000.

199
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,800
The price is secondary. I must hold a majority of the shares for this project.

200
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:49,400
But you went to negotiate so many times already and they didn't agree to it.

201
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:53,200
They didn't say agree before because they haven't exhausted their resources (capital).

202
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,800
Now, should be a perfect time.

203
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,200
Ziru.

204
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,670
You can go back first.

205
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,700
How did you get here so quickly?

206
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,000
I happened to be nearby.

207
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,400
How long have you waited?

208
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,200
Not very long. Just a few minutes.

209
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,200
Let's go?

210
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:33,970
I think I saw the inventor of my Yiwen company just now.

211
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:38,300
You didn't recognize the wrong person, did you?

212
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,980
I don't think so.

213
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,200
That's also possible.

214
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,200
A lot of people in the finance industry come to that club for dinner.

215
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,100
You were in such a hurry to see me, did you miss me?

216
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,800
You are half-correct.

217
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,800
What about the other half?

218
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,800
As for the other half, I have good news.

219
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:11,900
Professor Gao's lab is starting second-round financing.

220
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,700
I have already given up on investing in that project of his.

221
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,500
Haven't you been quite interested in that project this whole time?

222
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,800
I have invested in two other labs

223
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,100
with lower risks and better prospects than his.

224
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:30,500
Got it.

225
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:43,600
Director Gong, that's everything in our lab.

226
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,900
Although our lab is small,

227
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:47,700
we have everything we need.

228
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,600
Professor Gao strictly checks every detail.

229
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,800
This is all of his life's hark work.

230
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,900
What do you think, Director Gong?

231
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,300
It's okay.

232
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,800
Director Gong, do you have any more questions?

233
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,000
My question is will this experiment of yours

234
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,600
really be successful?

235
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,800
I can only say that since the establishment of this lab,

236
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:17,000
today is the day we are closest to succeeding.

237
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,400
Excuse me, Director Gong. I'm going to answer a call.

238
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,500
Okay.

239
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,200
Let's sit down and talk, Director Gong.

240
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,800
Hello, Director Yang.

241
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,100
Are you also interested in Dubu's shares?

242
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,200
Hey, Haowen.

243
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,400
Come here.

244
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,200
What is it?

245
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,400
To be honest,

246
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,600
¥10,000,000 for 20% of the shares,

247
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,800
I absolutely cannot accept that.

248
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,800
Then, how much can you accept?

249
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,000
¥5,000,000.

250
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,400
¥5,000,000? That a bit too ruthless, don't you think?

251
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,300
60%.

252
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,200
You want to hold the majority of shares with just this little bit of money?

253
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,200
Yes. I must.

254
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,800
Don't say "must" just yet.

255
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:10,000
Putting money aside, Professor would never agree to you holding the majority of the shares.

256
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,200
If I cannot hold a majority of the shares, then this is pointless.

257
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,000
Director Gong.

258
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,400
Say, when you invested in our company,

259
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,400
you didn't want to hold a majority of the shares.

260
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,400
Why are you so interested in that for this project?

261
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,200
I can see the future of your company.

262
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,700
However, for this one, I'm really gambling here.

263
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,600
I can't decide on this matter myself.

264
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,000
I will discuss it with the partners.

265
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,800
Okay. You guys discuss it first.

266
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,800
Let me know after you all discuss it. I'm leaving now.

267
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,800
- I will walk you out. 
 - No need.

268
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,200
Take care.

269
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,400
Siyu, Director Gong is leaving!

270
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,700
Take care.

271
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,800
How did it go?

272
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,700
The good news is that he made a counter-offer.

273
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:09,000
The bad news is that there is no way we can accept the counter-offer he made.

274
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,740
I don't agree.

275
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,200
I don't want anything else.

276
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,800
Just one thing. Whether Dubu succeeds or fails,

277
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,400
we must hold the majority of the shares.

278
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,600
But with the present circumstances, we have no choice.

279
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,300
I think Professor Gao's concerns are valid.

280
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:33,380
Dubu is about to fail before it even truly begins. 
 (T/N: literal translation is a fetus dying in the womb)

281
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,400
Is there a need to decide whose surname the child will take and what the child's name is?

282
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,700
Stop arguing.

283
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,600
Haowen, call Director Gong back.

284
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,200
¥5,000,000 for 49%.

285
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,400
If he is willing to do that, then we can immediately sign the contract.

286
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,000
If he is not willing to do that, then we can think of other ways.

287
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,800
What ways?

288
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:02,700
Worse comes to worst, I'll sell another 10 years of my labor.

289
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:08,700
49... 1.02...

290
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,200
6.63...

291
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,700
42.33...

292
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,100
That's not impossible.

293
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:21,700
President Wang, the reason why you want to invest and hold the majority of the shares

294
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:25,200
is the fear that if Dubu succeeds, it would threaten Lubao.

295
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,600
However, after going there today, I can conclude

296
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,200
that they won't succeed.

297
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,800
Why?

298
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:39,400
First, the lab is the most dilapidated lab that I've ever seen.

299
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,800
Second, although they seem very confident,

300
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,700
they are actually uncertain as well.

301
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,800
Then your suggestion is?

302
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:53,200
My suggestion is that there is no need for us to invest.

303
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,200
Let them, who are at a dead-end, give up on the project themselves.

304
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,800
They won't give up.

305
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,700
However, if they don't have money, then they must accept their fate.

306
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,600
Based on Gao Zhengdao's stubborn

307
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,600
plus Li Siyu's craziness,

308
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,200
they can do anything.

309
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:22,210
Sister Yuan, say, how should I take care of this?

310
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:27,400
First, why does your subordinate want to leave?

311
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,000
Secondly, is she worth keeping?

312
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,600
Figure out these two questions and you'll know what to do.

313
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,400
This issue is a bit complicated.

314
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,800
This person... in the past...

315
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,000
- actually was— 
 - Hey!

316
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,800
Zhizhi!

317
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,400
Director Wu.

318
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,800
Let me introduce you. This is my previous leader.

319
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,900
No need to introduce. I have met Director Yuan many times now.

320
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,400
- Long time no see. 
 - Yes.

321
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:57,600
Did you know? The headhunting company recommended Director Yuan to us in the beginning.

322
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,200
Afterward, Director Yuan strongly recommended you.

323
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,000
She said you were very capable, young, and have a good personality.

324
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,200
So I had HR to send you a message.

325
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,800
How is it, Director Wu? The people I recommend are not bad, right?

326
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,400
That's right. After she came,

327
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,400
sales improved a lot.

328
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,300
So I have to thank you!

329
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:18,000
If you want to thank me, then do so by placing an order.

330
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,200
No problem.

331
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,000
You two talk. I still have some business to tend to.

332
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,800
Go ahead. I will go looking for you for that order later.

333
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,000
- No problem! 
 - Bye-bye.

334
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
- Bye-bye. 
 - Goodbye.

335
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,400
I have been perplexed this whole time.

336
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,600
How can a rookie like me, who's been in the industry for less than a year,

337
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,100
get this position?

338
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,200
Turns out that you've been helping me this whole time.

339
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,300
It's nothing.

340
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,400
Sister Yuan,

341
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,800
why did you recommend me?

342
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:01,700
I felt like I played a part in you leaving Lubao.

343
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,200
So recommending you for the job could be considered my compensation to you.

344
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:11,200
But I've never been a manager before.

345
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,900
Weren't you afraid that I wouldn't be competent enough for this position?

346
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:19,600
Zhizhi, you qualify for sure!

347
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,300
First, you are kind and gentle.

348
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,400
Secondly, you were able to endure my torment in the beginning. It clearly shows that you are very strong.

349
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,400
Third, after my tormenting,

350
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:37,800
you didn't hold a grudge against me and you still became my friend. That clearly shows that you are open-minded.

351
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:42,400
And the three points mentioned are the key features of a team leader.

352
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,800
Am I that great?

353
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,600
You, of course, have your shortcomings.

354
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,700
You are easily swayed by your emotions.

355
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:52,300
You are not rational enough when considering an issue.

356
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
However, you are good at learning. So by putting you in a manager position,

357
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,200
you can definitely overcome your own personal prejudices

358
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,300
in order to consider matters from a work perspective or in relation to the bigger picture.

359
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,200
By the way,

360
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,940
who's the subordinate wanting to resign that you were just talking about?

361
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:19,000
Who she is is no longer important.

362
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,400
I know what I should do now.

363
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,800
Sister Yuan, a toast to you with water in place of wine.

364
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,600
Thank you.

365
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:34,010
All right. It's settled then.

366
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:46,800
We're doing as you said, ¥5,000,000 for 49%.

367
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,600
- Let's continue. 
 - Let's continue.

368
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,700
Don't continue yet, Professor Gao.

369
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:57,400
This is our last chance. We can only succeed. We can't fail.

370
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,980
Did I need you to remind me?

371
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,800
Haowen, thank you.

372
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,200
If you really want to thank me, then tell Xiaoling about

373
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,200
my great achievement. Tell her that I,

374
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,200
Lei Haowen, have a reliable side.

375
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,400
I will definitely relay that to her.

376
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,400
Tell her three times, okay?

377
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,300
Check this. See if there are any more mistakes.

378
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,600
Xiao He, fill this out and sign it.

379
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,000
Wei Yayun. Come in for a moment.

380
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,400
Okay.

381
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,280
Sit.

382
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,800
I heard you want to resign.

383
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:22,000
No, I'm not.

384
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,100
Is it because of me?

385
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,800
Yes.

386
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,200
No! It's because I—

387
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,800
If it is because of me, then it's totally unnecessary.

388
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,600
Since I am sitting in the manager seat,

389
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:44,800
then I must consider the company's interest above all.

390
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:50,800
If you can create profit for the company,

391
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:54,800
I can absolutely put my personal grudges aside.

392
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,500
But...

393
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:06,020
I did that kind of thing to you,

394
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,970
can you really forgive me?

395
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,600
Indeed,

396
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:18,300
we had an unpleasant experience in the past.

397
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,110
But now,

398
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
I have gotten back everything I've lost,

399
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,810
and more.

400
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:33,200
So even though I can't forgive you for now,

401
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,200
I don't hate you.

402
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,500
Manager Zhang,

403
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,900
sorry.

404
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:50,400
From now on, there's no need to say that word.

405
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,800
When you say sorry to me,

406
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,800
I don't feel touched or relieved.

407
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,200
Because who you are sorry to

408
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,800
is the Zhang Zhizhi in the past.

409
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,000
The present me

410
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,570
doesn't need your apology.

411
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I've familiarized myself with your situation.

412
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,400
You just joined the company for less than three months,

413
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,500
but you've been working hard the whole time.

414
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:26,500
As a new staff member, being able to make a deal with a big client

415
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:30,600
is considered very outstanding.

416
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,600
I should say that this company

417
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,200
and this job suits you very well.

418
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,400
You should cherish it well.

419
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,860
I also don't want to leave.

420
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,100
It's just...

421
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,700
If you must leave,

422
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:54,600
then at least get this commission first.

423
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,000
After all, you've worked hard for three months.

424
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:04,830
It's very difficult... working hard out in the world alone.

425
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,600
If you have a little more money on you, you can solve a lot of problems.

426
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,000
Sister Zhizhi,

427
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I never thought that you... you would actually...

428
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,600
treat me like this. I—

429
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,700
I was wrong.

430
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:34,990
I really was wrong.

431
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,500
I'm sorry.

432
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,800
Hello.

433
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:57,200
Ms. Gu, I'm slightly raising the rent for next year.

434
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,200
How much are you raising it by?

435
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,000
I want to raise it to ¥4,200 a month.

436
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,800
How is that slightly? That is a huge increase!

437
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,200
It's just ¥200 more.

438
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,400
You-how is that ¥200? You're increasing it by ¥700!

439
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,200
If I were to increase it by ¥700,

440
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,200
then I would be getting ¥4,700 a month from you.

441
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,600
Hold up, did you get it wrong?

442
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,200
I have always been paying ¥3,500 a month.

443
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:25,500
Are you the one who got it wrong? I've always been charging you ¥4,000 a month.

444
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,800
Sis, take care. If you need anything, please come again.

445
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,400
Please take your banknotes.

446
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:14,200
Is it starting again?

447
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,400
Is there hope this time?

448
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,100
I don't know.

449
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:26,400
How much is left of the ¥5,000,000 that Director Gong gave?

450
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,400
A little over ¥30,000.

451
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:31,600
What? A little over ¥30,000?

452
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,600
Then if we fail this time, we're all done for?

453
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,000
Theoretically, that is correct.

454
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,500
Then, why didn't you say so earlier?

455
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,500
Lower your voice.

456
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:47,400
Last time, didn't you say we still had over ¥2,000,000 left?

457
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,800
After last time, Professor Gao changed the plan.

458
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,400
Everything was re-adjusted.

459
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,230
Is there any hope this time?

460
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,200
Yes.

461
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,400
Yes. You say that every single time.

462
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,770
Then, what do you hope I say?

463
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,200
Is there really hope this time?

464
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:21,390
What did Professor Gao say about it?

465
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:25,200
Never mind. Professor Gao's words aren't accurate nowadays. What did Liu Yang say about it?

466
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,400
Can you calm down a bit?

467
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,600
In total, ¥10,000,000 was spent on this. How am I supposed to calm down?

468
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,200
Even at a casino, you wouldn't spend money like that, right?

469
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,100
Shut up!

470
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,800
It's over, it's over. I'm going to lose everything.

471
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,800
Lei Haowen, can you please have some pride?

472
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:52,280
No wonder Gu Xiaoling didn't choose you.

473
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,600
That's right. Xiaoling.

474
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:00,200
Xiaoling safeguard me. Xiaoling safeguard me.

475
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:07,400
Xiao-Xiao-Xiaoling.

476
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,600
How has she been recently?

477
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,100
The same as always.

478
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:18,000
I haven't cared about her for days.

479
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,400
[Congratulate me. Give me your blessing.]

480
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,600
Did something happen to Xiaoling?

481
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,900
What is all this that she's posting on her WeChat Moment?

482
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:36,990
Say something. Look.

483
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,000
Xiaoling...

484
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,500
Xiaoling and He Mu signed the prenuptial agreement.

485
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,600
Who is it?

486
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,000
Xiaoling. Open the door.

487
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,700
Xiaoling!

488
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,200
Open the door! I have something to say to you!

489
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,800
What are you doing?!

490
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,800
Open the door!

491
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,500
What are you doing?

492
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,700
Wait! What are you doing?!

493
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,800
- You can't marry him. 
 - How is it any of your business?

494
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,200
What's so great about that He Mu?

495
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,800
He Mu can give me what I want!

496
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,400
For money, you'd sell yourself?

497
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,800
You don't understand anything!

498
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,800
Since you're selling yourself, why don't you sell yourself to me instead of him!

499
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,800
Fine. He Mu is offering ¥5,000,000. How much are you offering?

500
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,100
¥5,000,000. I'll give it to you!

501
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,300
Then transfer it to me right now.

502
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,600
I don't have money right now, but—

503
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,600
If you don't have money, then why are you whining?

504
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,500
Not having money is only temporary!

505
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,100
You temporarily don't have money.

506
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,400
You are temporarily a poor, penniless man.

507
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,600
Your "temporary" is actually "forever"!

508
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,300
Once Dubu succeeds, I'm worth ¥300,000,000!

509
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:14,200
When the time comes, you'll regret it! Just you wait!

510
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:17,100
Scram! Scram!

511
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:25,000
Gu Xiaoling, what's so great about you?!

512
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,200
Let me tell you, you'll regret it for sure!

513
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,700
You're just a bit pretty, that's all. Right?

514
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:32,600
You just have a nice body and a good temperament, that's all. Right?

515
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,000
I will definitely buy you!

516
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:57,000
Lei Haowen, let it go.

517
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,300
Maybe you and Xiaoling really aren't fated to be together.

518
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:07,000
No matter how I think about it, I can't figure out how someone just sells herself for ¥5,000,000.

519
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
You can't talk about Xiaoling like that.

520
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
He Mu has his own good attributes.

521
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,100
What's good about him? Doesn't he just have some stinky money?

522
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,300
We must succeed this time.

523
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,600
We will definitely succeed this time!

524
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,800
 Let's rest for a bit. Just stop looking and go rest for a bit. 

525
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,400
What happened?

526
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:08,600
I don't know either. Professor Gao suddenly turned off the machine.

527
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,800
W-W-What was the result?

528
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,400
He didn't say. We haven't gotten to the testing stage yet.

529
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,600
W-What do you think?

530
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,000
Are you becoming a coward now?

531
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,600
I, Gao Zhengdao, have never been a coward in my life.

532
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:03,300
Then why did you suddenly stop at the last moment?

533
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:10,000
In my heart, you have always repeatedly fought on despite the repeated failures.

534
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,700
You are the Professor Gao who can't be defeated and who is not afraid to lose.

535
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:23,800
But this time, I'm a bit afraid.

536
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,900
Afraid of what?

537
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,600
I'm afraid that if it fails, then our lab will have no choice but to close down.

538
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,000
What's so scary about closing down?

539
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:39,400
I'm not afraid. I've already accepted that

540
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,800
I'm a failure in this lifetime.

541
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,400
However...

542
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,200
However, all of these workers,

543
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:51,300
Liu Yang, you, and Haowen...

544
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,600
they all had so much hope.

545
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:58,900
Everyone's put so much money and time into this. Some are even going bankrupt.

546
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:03,000
If we fail this time,

547
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,400
then I don't know how I will be able to face them.

548
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:17,100
Before the age of 32, I had never failed either.

549
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,100
However, starting Laidianle caused me to lose everything.

550
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:26,750
At that time, with all my hopes crushed, I escape to my hometown.

551
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,840
But now that I think about it,

552
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,400
the thing that caused me to grow up in the quickest way and gain the most

553
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,300
was actually that experience of failure.

554
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,100
Aren't you afraid of failure?

555
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:43,900
I am, but I'm more afraid of giving up.

556
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,600
As long as you don't give up,

557
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,600
failure is just the stepping stone to success. However, if you give up,

558
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:55,200
then failure is really just failure.

559
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:01,700
If we fail this time, then we have no choice but to give up.

560
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:02,800
No.

561
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:07,600
It's just a pause. I will do everything in my power to get the lab up and running again.

562
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:11,400
There's a possibility that you'll never see the day this succeeds in this lifetime.

563
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,000
If we give up halfway,

564
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,700
then, in this life, I will definitely never be able to see the day when this succeeds.

565
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:27,400
Shall we continue?

566
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,200
We will continue.

567
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:40,860
Professor Gao!

568
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,800
When I left my hometown, my dad told me

569
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,200
that happiness is most important.

570
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,800
The joy you get from working hard is the most important.

571
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,600
Your dad has more wisdom than you do.

572
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,400
Ha. Ha.

573
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,600
Xiao Wu.

574
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:37,000
Professor Gao! Professor Gao!

601
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:07,000

♫  We are so small yet so determined  ♫

603
