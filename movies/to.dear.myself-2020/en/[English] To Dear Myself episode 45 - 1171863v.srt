00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,800
[Episode 45]

4
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,000
Who is it?

5
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,200
Who is it?

6
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,800
You sold the house?

7
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,900
Yeah.

8
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,100
You still gave money to Li Siyu?

9
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,200
Yes.

10
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,200
Didn't I tell you not to do that?!

11
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,400
I felt like I should do that.

12
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,200
I treat you so well!

13
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,000
Why do you have to go against me?!

14
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,100
I didn't.

15
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,640
Do you still love her?

16
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,800
The person I love is you.

17
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,600
Then, why did you sell your only house

18
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,900
to support her?!

19
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:47,960
I just felt guilty towards her.

20
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,400
Okay. You go be guilty then.

21
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,000
Ziru.

22
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,400
President Wang has already left.

23
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,000
I want to see you.

24
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:51,000
Director Gong.

25
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,800
Would you like to drink something? Tea or water?

26
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,200
No, thank you.

27
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,600
Are you the only one here?

28
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,400
Professor Gao and Liu Yang went to see the factory.

29
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,200
They entrusted me to represent them.

30
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,700
Okay.

31
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:16,800
However, I can't seem to get in touch with Haowen.

32
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,000
It doesn't matter if he is here or not.

33
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,800
Lei Haowen is also a shareholder of Dubu.

34
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,800
He should be here, right?

35
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,400
He is no longer one.

36
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,200
What do you mean?

37
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:33,300
I called everyone here today because I wanted to announce that

38
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,600
Dubu Project's subsequent research is going to be put on pause.

39
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,900
At the same time, mass production will be stopped.

40
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,000
Director Gong, do you know what you are saying right now?

41
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
What you heard is what I want to say.

42
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,500
Why do you think you can do this?

43
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,600
I'm the largest shareholder of this project right now.

44
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,800
Your Huangjin Investment only possesses 49% of the shares.

45
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,000
Xinlu Investment, Professor Gao and Liu Yang,

46
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,200
together hold the majority of the shares, 51%.

47
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,600
Director Gong,

48
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,300
in Dubu's project, you don't have the right to decide.

49
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,210
Ms. Li,

50
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,000
did you forget

51
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,800
that Lei Haowen and you have sold Xinlu Investments to me?

52
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,300
What?

53
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,600
In addition, all of Xinlu Investment's Dubu shares were transferred to Huangjin Investment.

54
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,600
Xinlu's 6.63% plus Huangjin's 49%

55
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,800
equals 55.63% in total.

56
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,800
Sorry,

57
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,600
I make the decisions for this project now.

58
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,400
I never signed this contract.

59
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,610
Do you not recognize your own signature?

60
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:57,720
[Your account ending in 4823 has received a transfer from Lei Haowen of ¥6,000,000.]

61
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,800
What material?

62
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:05,270
Some amendments to the articles.

63
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:08,640
We have already signed them. You can just sign it.

64
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,100
Here. Just sign it first.

65
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,900
Lei Haowen.

66
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,100
He won't pick up your call.

67
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,900
You bribed him?

68
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,100
You are also one of the investors.

69
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,400
How does stopping Dubu's research benefit you?

70
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,200
This is our largest shareholder's decision.

71
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,800
You just need to comply with it.

72
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,000
Who?

73
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,500
I can't tell you.

74
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,400
When she walks over there, the lights here need to be turned on and you guys need to start playing the music.

75
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,200
Okay. Okay.

76
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,600
Also, the music should be slow. Don't rush it.

77
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:56,600
Play the music according to the pace at which she's walking. Then I will most likely

78
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,800
walk in this direction to propose to right here.

79
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,200
Okay. Okay. No problem.

80
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,400
Lei Haowen.

81
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,200
Contact me immediately. Otherwise, you will suffer the consequences. 

82
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,600
Okay. You guys go set up first.

83
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,600
Rehearse the music well.

84
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,400
Okay. Okay.

85
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,400
Let's prepare.

86
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,800
 If you dare to keep hiding from me, 

87
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,600
then I'll make it so that you can never see Gu Xiaoling ever again!

88
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,800
Are you crazy?

89
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,800
Why did you sell Xinlu at such a low price?

90
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,400
Why did you trick me into signing the contract?

91
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,200
What on earth do you want to do?

92
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,800
Siyu, I need the money to save Xiaoling.

93
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,600
Are you stupid?

94
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,200
Do you think she will agree to marry you if you do this?

95
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,700
I know that you all think I'm stupid.

96
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,200
However, what is done is done so I hope you can understand me.

97
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,400
Do you know how many people's

98
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,900
hard work you are ruining for your obsession?!

99
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,000
Sorry.

100
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You are breaking the law!

101
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,300
Come back immediately!

102
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,200
Xiaoling, come here immediately.

103
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,500
There is something very, very, very important that I want to discuss with you.

104
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,800
[Li Siyu]

105
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,900
Do you know what Lei Haowen did?

106
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:01,000
♫ Always believed you would appear ♫

107
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,800
♫ in my life ♫

108
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,400
♫ Always sure that you're ♫

109
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,800
[This is the man that Heaven is giving you.] 
 ♫ the love I'm waiting for ♫

110
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,400
[This is the man that Heaven is giving you.] 
 ♫ Even if time is pressuring us ♫

111
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,800
Xiaoling,

112
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,000
when I proposed to you last time,

113
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,200
you wanted the lanterns to be diamonds instead.

114
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,000
I've done that now.

115
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,400
♫ Don't know if we could meet again in our next lives ♫

116
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,800
♫ In this lifetime, I just want to watch the scenery with you ♫

117
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,600
♫ Give the best of myself ♫

118
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,000
♫ To my dearest you ♫

119
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,100
There is ¥5,000,000 in here.

120
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,800
Marry me.

121
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,800
Where did you get the money from?

122
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,200
I earned it.

123
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,800
How did you earn it?

124
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,200
Investment income.

125
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,200
You scammed Li Siyu of her money! You sold Xinlu Investment at a cheap price!

126
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,000
Siyu invested ¥3,000,000 into it.

127
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,700
I gave her ¥6,000,000. She didn't lose money.

128
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,000
That company is worth over ¥100,000,000

129
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,600
yet you sold it for a mere ¥10,200,000!

130
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,800
When I sold it, it was not worth a cent.

131
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,000
Are you actually stupid or just evil?

132
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,600
Xiaoling,

133
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:39,530
isn't the person I am right now

134
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,000
whom you've always wanted to marry?

135
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,000
You right now

136
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,600
is a shortsighted asshole who is blinded by greed!

137
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,400
I really love you.

138
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,800
I'm really, really disgusted by you!

139
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,200
I'm really, really disgusted by you!

140
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,410
I'm wrong!

141
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,900
I can't live without you.

142
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:35,160
Why did I ask him for ¥5,000,000?

143
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,400
I'm also not a good person.

144
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:20,600
Gong Jing planned this from the beginning.

145
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,800
Yes.

146
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,500
We were all tricked by him.

147
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,200
Professor Gao! Professor Gao!

148
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,000
Professor Gao!

149
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,200
You must provide sufficient evidence

150
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:50,200
to prove that you were tricked into signing this contract.

151
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:54,300
That way you can ask the court or an arbitration institution

152
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,800
to cancel or change this transfer agreement.

153
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,200
Are there any other ways to go about this?

154
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,600
If Lei Haowen or Gong Jing confess to their crime

155
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,000
and admit to fraud, then this will be easy to take care of.

156
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
You can call the police.

157
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,400
It's all my fault. I misled him.

158
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:22,600
If someone's to be blamed for this, then blame him for being so muddle-headed and blame me for being careless.

159
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:27,000
If it weren't to stop me from marrying He Mu, then he wouldn't have betrayed you.

160
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,800
This has nothing to do with you.

161
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,000
He is an adult. He knows what he is doing.

162
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,600
Don't call him anymore.

163
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,900
I have already left messages on all of his social media. He hasn't replied to me at all.

164
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,150
We must find Lei Haowen.

165
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,800
I think your ideas and

166
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,400
creativity for this project are all very good.

167
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,400
Our collaboration this time was a very pleasant experience, President Chen!

168
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,800
- I hope we can continue working together next time! 
 - Yes.

169
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,800
Okay. Goodbye, President Chen!

170
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,400
- Okay. Take care. 
 - See you. 
 - Bye-bye.

171
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,400
Hello? Xiaoling.

172
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,300
Do you know where Lei Haowen is?

173
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,400
I haven't seen him for a while, either.

174
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,200
Do you know what he did?

175
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:35,790
Rest assured, President Wang. I've already prepared everything.

176
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:40,100
Come in. All the media outlets will speak about this at the same time on that day.

177
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,800
Director Gong, Chen Yiming is looking for you.

178
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:49,000
President Wang, Chen Yiming came looking for me. Should I see him or not?

179
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:51,650
Treat him well.

180
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:56,200
However, you should know

181
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,600
what should be said and what shouldn't be.

182
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,800
I know.

183
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,200
Have him come in.

184
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,300
I am hanging up then, President Wang.

185
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,900
Yiming?!

186
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:19,860
What brings you here?

00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,600
Where is Lei Haowen?

What are you talking about?

189
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,800
I'm asking you, where is Lei Haowen?

190
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,600
How would I know?

191
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,200
Gong Jing,

192
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,400
I'll give you another chance.

193
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,800
You can either confess your crime of fraud,

194
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,200
or tell me where Lei Haowen is right now.

195
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,000
Chen Yiming, please pay attention to your tone.

196
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,600
I'm your investor.

197
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,400
Who is your largest shareholder?

198
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,200
I can't tell you.

199
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,000
The contract didn't say that I can't beat you up.

200
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,800

201
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,800
You don't look very well.

202
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:01,900
Did you not sleep well last night or are you not feeling well?

203
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:23,000
According to the road conditions right now,

204
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I think we will arrive at the civil affairs bureau in 23 minutes.

205
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,400
Then we will use 15 minutes to complete the procedure.

206
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,400
Then I will use 32 minutes to get back to the company

207
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,400
at 16:30. I will be just in time for the video conference.

208
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,800

In addition, after we get the marriage certificate,

211
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,800
we can start preparing for the wedding.

Siyu: Is there any news of Lei Haowen today?

213
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,600
You must choose four of them within one week.

Then make a table with the pros and cons 
 [No.]

of these four companies.

216
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:02,800
We will then decide on which wedding planning company to use.

217
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,900

What's wrong?

00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,600
He Mu,

222
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,200
can we...

00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:13,510
can we get the marriage certificate another day?

224
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,800
According to the plan,

225
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:19,800
we should have gotten it two months ago.

226
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:24,550
I'm in a really bad mood right now. I feel very confused now.

227

I have a very important meeting.

Just give me a few more days.

231
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,800
I already made all the plans that come after this.

236
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,800

Can you not be so wilful? Okay?

00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,100
But I don't want to get this marriage certificate today!

243
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,900
Can you control your emotions?

244
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:30,200
That is a basic ability of adults.

245
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,600
Do you think I'm not controlling it?

Let me tell you.

247
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,600
From the moment I saw today, I've been controlling myself

248
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,800

So what if this is a public place?

251
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:50,200
Do I need to wear a mask and be fake just because I'm in a public place?

252
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,400
He Mu,

253
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,400
I hate healthy food. I only like junk food.

254
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,600
I don't like watching Discovery. I only like to keep up with gossip.

255
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,600
I have zero interest in elegant things.

256
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,600
I'm not graceful and calm.

257
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:12,200

He Mu, I don't love you!

If it really is how you said it is

267
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,600
and you were pretending before,

268
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:00,200
it means you did put in the effort for me.

Are you sure you want all of that effort to be in vain?

270

Yeah.

For a failure like me,

00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,200

This Huangjin Investment is quite complicated.

282
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,400
This is its shareholders' situation.

283
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,200
There are 9 shareholders in total. MH Group

284
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,800
holds 89% of the shares. It's the largest shareholder.

285
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,300
This is all material on MH Group.

286
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:00,880
MH Group is Langfei Investment's holding company.

287
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,100
That's right.

288
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:06,660
This is Langfei Investment's material.

289
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,700
Zhilan Group then owns the majority of the shares of Langfei investment.

290
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:21,200
However, Zhilan Group isn't the final, true controller.

291
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:28,000
Tianye Group is Zhilan's largest shareholder.

292
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,600
So I'm sure

293
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:34,600
that Tianye Group's President, Wang Ziru, is Huangjin Investment's largest shareholder.

294
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:02,600
A friend just told me that during Lubao's bidding crisis,

295
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,800
a company called Langfei spent ¥40,000 on an "internet water army"  (T/N: a group of people posting certain content in accordance to those who paid them; very common and controversial in China) 

296
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,400
to make negative comments about Lubao.

297
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,000
Then the person who is truly controlling Langfei Group is...

298
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,300
It's also Wang Ziru.

356
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,100
I've hit and cursed at you before.

357
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,800
We've cut off all ties with each other before.

358
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:45,200
I've very deeply hurt you before but I've never lied to you before.

359
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,600
It's already too late to say those things now.

360
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,200
Not too late.

361
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,400
I-I-I'm saying it's too late for me.

362
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,200
I can't go back anymore.

363
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,000
The present I prepared for you before.

364
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,800
Before I could gift it to you,

365
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
we broke things off.

366
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,800
I made it myself.

367
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,900
I just recently found out

368
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:39,800
that in order for me to live more comfortably,

369
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,900
you helped pay a part of my rent every month.

370
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,100
I'll repay you for that.

371
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:51,040
However, in regards to your good intentions,

372
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,920
I don't want to miss out on it anymore.

373
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,600
But I'm a disgrace now.

374
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,300
Why are you doing this? I'm not worth it.

375
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,800
Because I can freely

376
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,000
be the most authentic Gu Xiaoling

377
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,800
only when I'm in front of you.

378
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:15,610
Haowen,

379
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,820
go back with me to confess your crime.

380
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,600
Confess my crime?

381
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,600
I will go to jail if I confess.

382
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,400
Shouldn't you go to jail and accept your punishment after doing what you've done?

383
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:31,000
You just said so much yet you still want me to go to jail?

384
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,300
Yes! I want you to go to jail and accept your punishment!

385
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:36,600
If possible, I would go to jail with you!

386
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:40,800
But are yo-y-you willing to be with someone who has been to jail before?

387
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,300
Lei Haowen,

388
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,700
whom I want to marry is a responsible man

389
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:50,100
with the courage to admit mistakes and change.

390
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:54,800
Not a wretched and weak coward!

391
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,800
I'll be in jail for at least three years for the things I've done.

392
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,600
Isn't it just three years?

393
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,600
Isn't it just three years? Can you wait for three years?

394
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,400
I've already waited for thirty years.

395
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,400
Would three years make a difference?

396
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,200
Xiaoling,

397
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,900
are you really willing to be with me?

398
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:17,210
Are you really willing to wait for me?

399
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:22,250
I am.

400
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,270
But I'm warning you!

401
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,200
I will only wait three years for you.

402
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,300
I won't wait for even one more day than that.

403
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,100
Therefore, get in there earlier so that you can get out earlier.

404
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,400
Xiaoling,

405
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,000
I, Lei Haowen,

406
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,600
won't let you down anymore.

407
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,000
[Serving the people]

408
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,400
Xiaoling, wait for me.

409
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,000
I'll wait for you!

410
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:21,900
I'll wait for you! I'll wait for you!

411
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:32,800
During the negotiation, it's normal to have some setbacks.

412
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,000
Yes.Yes.

413
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,600
Director Zeng. Director Qiu. Rest assured.

414
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:40,000
The final result will surely satisfy you two.

415
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,700
Okay. Okay.

416
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,000
Come in.

417
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,600
It's you?

418
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,400
It's me.

419
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:13,830
Why are you here?

420
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:15,760
Ziru,

421
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:20,100
Dubu will definitely restart.

422
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:22,200
This is the plan that I made to enhance Lubao's brand image

423
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:25,800
in response to Dubu entering the market.

424
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,800
Even if Dubu restarts,

425
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,800
they need at least three years to enter the market.

426
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,800
After three years,

427
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,000
I believe Lubao will surely have new products to compete with Dubu.

428
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,800
I don't need your plan.

429
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,800
No.

430
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,600
You need it for sure.

431
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:50,000
Otherwise, you wouldn't have instructed Gong Jing to bribe Lei Haowen into

432
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,400
obtaining Li Siyu's signature through fraud.

433
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:10,780
When did you find out?

434
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,200
Before, when we went to eat at the club.

435
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:18,000
The man I met was Gong Jing, right?

436
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:22,000
What else did you find out?

437
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,200
The reason why he invested in our company,

438
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,600
is not because of our talent

439
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:30,780
but because of your instructions.

440
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:33,790
I instigated him

441
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,400
because I really believed in you.

442
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:39,040
Thank you.

443
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,400
Thank you for protecting my self-esteem carefully

444
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:46,400
while you helped me.

445
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,000
Thank you.

446
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:53,900
What else did you find out?

447
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,000
At that time, Li Siyu

448
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,400
helped Liu Yang pay a portion of his mom's medical fee.

449
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,400
It was also you who hired an "internet water army"

450
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,400
to worsen the situation

451
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:09,220
and lower the valuation of Lubao.

452
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,200
Buy low and sell high. This is my talent.

453
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:18,300
Are bribery and fraud also your talents?

454
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:33,000
Since I am already so unbearable to you,

455
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,400
why don't you just directly break up?

456
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:38,860
Why did you write this plan?

457
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:45,810
Because I want to save our relationship.

458
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,200
I'm negotiating with FCC right now

459
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,800
to transfer the 23% of Lubao's shares that I hold

460
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,400
to them in exchange for  ¥5,000,000,000.

461
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,430
If, at this moment,

462
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:12,200
someone says that Lubao will die in three years,

463
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,200
then would anyone be willing to buy Lubao?

464
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:21,000
So you decided to sell Lubao first and then unfreeze Dubu?

465
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
That was what I was originally thinking of doing.

466
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,700
In the end, Gong Jing ruined everything.

467
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,600
The FCC called me just now.

468
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:33,700
They say they want to reconsider. They plan on canceling this purchase.

469
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:39,800
I remember you spent almost ¥800,000,000 to buy Lubao.

470
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,300
That's right.

471
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,200
However, you have

472
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:47,800
49% of Dubu's shares.

473
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,800
The market value of Dubu is at least ¥5,000,000,000.

474
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,400
Even if Lubao fails, you won't lose money.

475
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:59,600
Because I added (financial) leverage when I purchased Lubao.

476
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,800
The agreement was to turn that ¥800,000,000 into ¥3,000,000,000 in one year.

477
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:10,000
So if this purchase fails, then I'll lose all of my assets!

478
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,300
As well as all my Dubu shares!

479
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,600
So that's the situation.

480
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,300
I'm already standing on the edge of a cliff now.

481
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,600
The reason why I'm using fair and foul  methods

482
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,900
is I'm in a difficult position as well.

483
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:29,190
But what you did is wrong.

484
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,390
Yes.

485
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:36,420
I regret it very much as well. I shouldn't have asked Gong Jing to do that.

486
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,200
Are you still willing to accept me now?

487
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,350
What do you plan to do next?

488
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,000
I haven't thought about it yet.

489
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,300
Ziru.

490
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,200
The whole situation isn't as bad as you think.

491
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,200
I can immediately modify the plan and try

492
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,800
to regain the public's trust towards Lubao in the shortest time.

493
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:21,780
Thank you,

494
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,600
but I don't think that's necessary anymore.

495
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,200
It is. I think it is necessary.

496
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:30,400
Even if it's the last gamble, I want to try it.

497
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,300
This method...

498
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:35,060
will probably produce very little effect.

499
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,900
But I don't want to give up.

500
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:43,070
Ziru.

501
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:49,180
You've always supported me.

502
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:54,070
This time, let me support you.

503
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:56,640
Okay?

504
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,400
Thank you.

505
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
It's early in the morning yet all of you aren't working.

506
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,200
Why are you all standing here?

507
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,400
You're back so everyone is happy.

508
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,300
What's there to be happy about?

509
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,200
We've already wasted a lot of time.

510
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:54,200
- Stop standing here. 
 - Everyone, go to work. Go back to where you should be.

511
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:17,200
Professor Gao, do you want to rest for a moment?

512
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,600
Are you okay? How about you sit down for a bit?

513
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,600
Liu Yang.

514
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,200
Look at my blood pressure,

515
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:08,900
blood oxygen, and heart rate.

516
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,500
They have all gone back to normal.

517
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,200
Everything is good now. Everything is good now.

518
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:30,400
♫  Holding onto ideals,  ♫

519
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,200
Wang Ziru is suspected of being involved in a hostile takeover

520
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:37,200
and disrupting the system of economic and financial management.

521
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,800
She has already been arrested. 

522
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,800
I heard that she lost in her gamble as well.

523
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,400
She is heavily in debt now.

524
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,200
She deserves it!

525
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,300
When is Haowen getting out?

526
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:49,000
The lawyers are doing the paperwork for his bail.

527
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,400
 I'm guessing soon! 

528
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,200
 Xiaoling, I really never thought 

529
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,500
 that you would give up on money and marry someone you love. 

530
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:58,400
Says who?

531
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,400
Money and love, I want both.

532
