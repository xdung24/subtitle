00:01:25,499 --> 00:01:32,599
# Google translate version for your reference #

2
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,319
He Mu, do you love me

3
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,920
I feel a little sick today

4
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,799
Go home and rest

5
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,599
Welcome next time

6
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:27,919
Send a position

7
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:44,000
Lixing, where is the soy sauce?

8
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,879
Inside the cabinet

9
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:45,960
Find it yourself

10
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,400
Lixing

11
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:10,840
Do you have a larger bowl

12
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,400
Find it yourself

13
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:43,840
Stop busy

14
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,319
Time to eat in a while

15
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:56,000
time to eat

16
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:57,879
Ok yeah

17
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,680
Susan, let's eat

18
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,240
Hungry

19
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:05,960
it is good

20
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,280
Let's go eat

21
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,240
Come

22
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:12,840
Come

23
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:14,840
Sit down

24
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,279
Wait

25
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,519
Before eating

26
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,680
Didn't I tell you

27
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,759
Wipe your hands clean

28
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,639
Otherwise there will be bacteria

29
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:23,399
I forgot

30
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,800
Come, dad will wipe it for you

31
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,759
Another

32
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:35,600
Ok clean

33
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,240
Eat

34
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,480
Just do a little

35
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,240
Quickly taste the noodles

36
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,279
how about it

37
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,120
This is what i have eaten

38
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,040
The best noodles

39
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:47,079
Really

40
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:47,800
right

41
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,879
The best one, eat more

42
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:51,439
Try it soon

43
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,120
This is the life I want most

44
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,079
I'm working hard outside

45
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:05,560
Where are you at home

46
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,240
Do housework and take care of children

47
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,680
After i come back every day

48
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,519
can be seen

49
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,199
Susan this cute smiley

50
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,879
There is also a bowl of hot noodle soup

51
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,199
Is it tomorrow weekend?

52
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:24,879
Ok

53
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:25,839
You didn't arrange it

54
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:27,040
If there is no arrangement

55
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:30,839
You morning help me take Susan

56
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:31,680
Send to training class

57
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:32,879
My company

58
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:33,920
Something to deal with

59
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,720
Estimated to be in the company for one day

60
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:42,480
Workers will come in the afternoon

61
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:43,680
You come back to look after

62
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,079
And the kids are abroad

63
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:53,319
It's easy to get upset

64
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,680
If you pass by the pharmacy

65
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,040
Go buy some medicine for kids

66
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,800
I'm afraid she will get sick and catch a cold or something

67
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:04,639
Come

68
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:06,639
Some greens

69
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,279
I thought

70
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,360
You don't care about me anymore

71
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,920
I don't want to answer you either

72
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,120
I can't stand it

73
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,160
The temptation of fat intestines

74
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,879
I want to break with you too

75
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:33,399
But I thought

76
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,480
Can't just lose like this

77
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:37,639
What are you thinking about then?

78
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:43,160
You haven't got married yet

79
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:45,319
Even if you are married

80
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:48,519
Isn't it possible to divorce?

81
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:50,519
Even if you stay

82
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,399
In case you want to make one

83
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:53,639
Extramarital affairs or something

84
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:54,920
I still have hope

85
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,800
Lei Haowen

86
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,360
If you still want

87
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,560
Be friends with me

88
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,040
Since then you have died this heart

89
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:09,120
Otherwise I will leave now

90
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:10,279
Never see you again

91
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,199
It's okay

92
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:16,680
Don't be angry

93
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:18,279
Sit down

94
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:20,879
Watching

95
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:25,920
Sit down

96
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,120
You

97
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:34,720
Have to give me some time

98
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:35,519
right

99
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:38,040
Have to make my little heart

100
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:39,240
Die slowly

101
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:43,319
Can only be friends

102
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:47,160
Friends drink

103
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,240
Come on, my favorite sausage

104
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:15,160
Lei Haowen

105
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,600
If i borrow 5 million from you

106
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,839
Will you lend me

107
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,560
The premise is that you have so much money

108
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,720
I borrow

109
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,199
I might not make it

110
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,560
Then borrow

111
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,799
Don't ask me what to do with the money

112
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:35,200
Do not ask

113
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:37,559
I'm not afraid of doing bad things

114
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,799
Don't i know you yet

115
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:42,960
thank you

116
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:44,600
You're welcome

117
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,360
Just your brain capacity

118
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:48,279
Apart from buying bags and clothes

119
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:49,879
What else can you save

120
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:52,559
Don't do it again

121
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:54,720
So excited why

122
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:55,879
It's alright

123
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:57,039
Young couple young couple arguing

124
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,080
You still said

125
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,159
Answer the phone

126
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:13,480
in argument

127
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,879
none of your business

128
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:17,039
Right right right

129
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:22,960
If you can really get five million

130
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,679
Enough

131
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,960
Why do you want so much money

132
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:28,320
not me

133
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:30,600
It's Li Siyu's prodigal daughter

134
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:32,360
Why she wants so much money

135
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:34,200
What kind of project is she working on recently

136
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,240
To invest

137
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,840
I'm going crazy these two days

138
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,039
Why are you blowing on your face?

139
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,000
See who's coming

140
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:04,639
mom

141
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:06,879
Did you have fun with dad today?

142
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,919
Happy

143
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,320
I have something to tell you

144
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,600
Just so I have something to tell you

145
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,799
be careful

146
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,639
Ok

147
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,679
Siyu is starting a business again

148
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:38,279
Still cooperate with your laboratory

149
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,399
Is this reliable?

150
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,840
What do you mean by reliable

151
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:51,240
Will the experiment succeed?

152
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,159
still have

153
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,600
Zero percent

154
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,960
Zero one hope

155
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:03,639
So low

156
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,279
Sister Na Siyu is too risky

157
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,080
I understand her

158
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:16,320
Can do what you like

159
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:18,279
The adventure is worth it

160
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:22,960
This is what you want to do

161
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:24,799
Yes

162
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,840
When graduates graduate

163
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:30,879
I just want to continue

164
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:32,600
Do research work

165
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,919
But reason tells me

166
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,480
Have to find a good job

167
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,360
This life

168
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,440
Can sit back and relax

169
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:44,440
So I got in

170
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,480
The previous unit

171
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,679
You stayed there for ten years

172
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,519
Actually in those ten years

173
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,559
I have moved countless times

174
00:11:58,559 --> 00:11:59,759
Want to change career

175
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,600
But dare not start again

176
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,200
Just think about it

177
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:11,919
Then now

178
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,240
Is it what you wanted?

179
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:17,960
of course

180
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,039
Although the income is very low now

181
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:24,360
But every day is fulfilling

182
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,759
Although the experiment keeps failing

183
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:30,759
But for

184
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:32,200
For those engaged in R&D

185
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,159
failure

186
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,360
Too normal

187
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:40,480
In case

188
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:43,240
Finally failed

189
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,120
What is the last

190
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,279
Only success is the last

191
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:52,240
As long as it fails

192
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,840
Not the end

193
00:12:57,399 --> 00:12:58,720
You never did this before

194
00:12:58,879 --> 00:12:59,960
You always seek stability

195
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:03,440
That was when I was young

196
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,559
Poor family conditions

197
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,600
No cost to make mistakes

198
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,600
So every step

199
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,080
Have to walk safely

200
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:14,960
But these two years

201
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,039
Experienced these things

202
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,799
I just found

203
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:20,279
Life is full of accidents

204
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,840
Be cautious

205
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,559
At last

206
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,919
Still fall into the pit

207
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:29,559
and so

208
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,799
Not so much looking forward and backward

209
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:33,120
Better choose one

210
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,320
What I like

211
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:36,120
Throw in

212
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:42,639
You really changed

213
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:47,279
You also changed

214
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,360
before

215
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,360
We never talk like this

216
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,399
You never ask

217
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:03,559
Unexpectedly after the divorce

218
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,039
We can still chat like this

219
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:09,519
It seems

220
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,200
Divorced

221
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:45,720
I thought about it

222
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,639
Give it back to you

223
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:15,320
You decided

224
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,759
what

225
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,039
Yuwei told me

226
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:32,639
Then you went to Europe with him

227
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:35,120
Still working

228
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,320
The welfare of their company is very good

229
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:42,480
After going

230
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:44,080
Don't need me to work

231
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,600
Do not worry

232
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:54,120
He treats Yuwei well

233
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:56,639
Also good for me

234
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,200
Zhizhi

235
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:08,279
I'm actually quite happy

236
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:11,720
I have no money

237
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,240
Not capable

238
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:16,200
If you stay with me

239
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,200
Still work

240
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:19,679
Too hard

241
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,200
But Susan's father

242
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,320
It's completely different

243
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:26,559
You follow him

244
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:29,759
You can live without worry

245
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:33,200
very good

246
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:38,279
Liu Yang

247
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:44,919
I never

248
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:46,120
I thought you had no money

249
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:52,240
I know

250
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:57,960
Zhizhi

251
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,480
You are a good wife

252
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,119
The best wife in the world

253
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,960
I'm not worthy

254
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,000
in fact

255
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:30,880
I like work

256
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:35,400
Do it if you like

257
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,119
Don't let yourself be frustrated

258
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:55,839
You should keep this

259
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,920
I always owe you

260
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,920
I am back

261
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,920
What are you doing

262
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,720
What are you doing

263
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:38,039
I checked

264
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:39,279
These bags

265
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:41,039
It’s more suitable to sell on pollen

266
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:43,680
A lot more money than a second-hand store

267
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:48,720
Xiaoling

268
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:49,960
These ones

269
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:51,759
It's all your heart

270
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,039
It's annoying to see you

271
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:57,079
Can you be refreshed

272
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:00,200
Row

273
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Wait for me to make money

274
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,200
I bought it all for you

275
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:04,079
double

276
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,000
Double

277
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:06,119
Deal

278
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,480
Answer the phone

279
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:22,799
Hey

280
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,079
Xiaoling, let's eat together tonight

281
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:26,319
Go to that house

282
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,240
Your favorite french restaurant

283
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,240
Today is not our date

284
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,640
I have an appointment with the client

285
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,119
So time is free

286
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:37,759
We can just meet

287
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,680
A guest from my house

288
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:42,000
I can not go

289
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:44,400
Can you see if

290
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,400
Move the time

291
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,559
We didn't meet last week

292
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,000
Can't move

293
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,519
She will leave Shanghai tomorrow

294
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,640
Ok

295
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:56,039
I wish you all

296
00:19:56,759 --> 00:19:57,519
have fun

297
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:07,160
in argument

298
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,000
I just want to be able to fight

299
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:12,279
What's going on

300
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:15,680
I asked him to borrow money

301
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:17,200
Not only does he not borrow

302
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,000
Let's go, let's talk about me

303
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,079
Xiaoling

304
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,000
About borrowing money

305
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:29,880
Borrowing is affection, not borrowing is duty

306
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,480
I think He Mu’s approach

307
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,440
Nothing wrong

308
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:36,920
But you are my sister

309
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,640
And I asked him to borrow

310
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,200
So what?

311
00:20:40,599 --> 00:20:41,279
the first

312
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,759
You two are not married yet

313
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:43,319
second

314
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:44,599
Even married

315
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,359
He has no obligation to help me either

316
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,279
He is so boring

317
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:49,720
Why should i marry him

318
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:51,960
Is it because he is rich

319
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,759
Now I need it

320
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,000
Not only did he stand by and watch him

321
00:20:58,039 --> 00:20:59,119
What am i getting married

322
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,200
Xiaoling

323
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,400
Break up with He Mu

324
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,559
Not because

325
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:14,680
He doesn't want to lend me money

326
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,680
But because

327
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,720
The sentence you just said

328
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,200
Which sentence

329
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,440
You married him for money

330
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,480
What's wrong

331
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:25,640
Nothing is wrong

332
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,440
But happy marriage

333
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,920
Must be because of love

334
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,079
Not because of money

335
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:31,799
You still believe in love

336
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:32,960
I always believe

337
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,720
You love Chen Yiming so much

338
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,440
Don't break up

339
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:41,200
I broke up with Chen Yiming

340
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:44,279
It just happens that the love is not deep enough

341
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,640
You two are engaged

342
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,720
Still love enough

343
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,880
Maybe our relationship

344
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,359
Just enough to get engaged

345
00:21:56,319 --> 00:21:57,599
Think of it now

346
00:21:58,079 --> 00:21:59,720
Two people are really together

347
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,680
Need to sacrifice a little bit of self

348
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:05,799
More need to be brave enough

349
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:07,480
Face the pressure of reality

350
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,480
And these

351
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,200
I'm not ready

352
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,279
when will you

353
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:15,359
Want to understand these

354
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,400
Call

355
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,839
After failure

356
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,440
That day

357
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,039
I look at myself in the mirror

358
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:32,559
anxiety

359
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:34,079
impetuous

360
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,079
Paranoid

361
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:40,039
Quick success

362
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,400
Defiant

363
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Such a woman

364
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,480
I hate myself

365
00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:49,599
Why should I ask others

366
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:50,359
Come to love me

367
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,640
what about now

368
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,440
right now

369
00:22:57,839 --> 00:22:59,480
Don't you think i'm cute

370
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:05,799
that

371
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:08,759
If there is another person now

372
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:09,799
How would you love

373
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:15,680
I will definitely still

374
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:17,519
Devote yourself

375
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:20,720
I hit my head and bleed

376
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,119
Still do not repent

377
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:24,359
Broke my blood

378
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:25,440
Can't change

379
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,319
Just in case you hit twice

380
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:28,400
The wall fell

381
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:30,079
This world is mine

382
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,200
I wish you happiness

383
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,319
Xiaoling

384
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,680
I wish you happiness too

385
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,599
Don't because of money

386
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:40,759
Go to marry someone

387
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,759
Only love will starve to death

388
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:45,960
Only love will starve to death

389
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:47,759
Let go

390
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,160
I can't tell you

391
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:50,160
Think quickly

392
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,440
What else can I sell

393
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,079
You see how much my bag is worth

394
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:06,359
More than a thousand

395
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:07,319
Let's sell it together

396
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,119
How did I forget Guan Xiaotang

397
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,000
Look at the super heroine I made

398
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:27,400
Wonderful

399
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,039
Will she sit with me

400
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:31,839
Zhizhi

401
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,680
Sorry

402
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,240
I didn't keep you

403
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:40,799
President Yuan

404
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:42,440
You have tried your best

405
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,799
to be frank

406
00:24:56,319 --> 00:24:57,240
Emerald is no longer

407
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,200
The previous emerald

408
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,519
I don't even know

409
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,000
How long can I stay in Lubao

410
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,519
How old is Yuwei this year

411
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:11,599
Five years old

412
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,759
When i divorced

413
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,359
Mengmeng is also five years old

414
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,319
President Yuan

415
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:24,960
Ok

416
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,599
I can ask you

417
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:26,559
Personal question

418
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,519
Just ask

419
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,839
You are alone

420
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,160
Is it very difficult

421
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:36,759
Of course

422
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,160
Have you ever thought about

423
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,119
Get back with Mengmeng's father

424
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:43,240
or

425
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,960
Find another person to marry

426
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,519
Do you think

427
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:51,279
Two people live together

428
00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:52,200
Must be better than

429
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,559
Living alone is easy

430
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,039
Ordinary people like us

431
00:25:57,359 --> 00:25:58,680
Nothing is easy

432
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:01,200
Since it's so difficult

433
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,960
Then we pick one

434
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:06,079
Reward yourself the highest thing

435
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,880
What is the highest reward

436
00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:11,920
Stronger self

437
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,680
Stronger self

438
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:17,720
Ok

439
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:21,440
All these years

440
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:22,960
I am alone with Meng Meng

441
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:25,400
Encountered countless problems

442
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:29,559
No reliance, no retreat

443
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:32,319
I can only face myself

444
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:34,720
Over time

445
00:26:36,759 --> 00:26:37,880
I am sick myself

446
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:41,200
Fame

447
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:42,720
Also not good

448
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:44,839
But i gained abilities

449
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:45,720
Gained confidence

450
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:47,920
And only this

451
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,960
Belongs to me

452
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,240
Wealth that no one can take away

453
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:55,759
Yes

454
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,440
Before my divorce

455
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,960
Never thought of myself

456
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,359
Can sell

457
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,200
After divorce

458
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,160
I actually did

459
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,200
The backbone of the sales department

460
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,359
Speaking of here

461
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,599
President Yuan, to you

462
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:13,839
Thank you for taking me in

463
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,359
no need to thank me

464
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:17,839
I used to be so harsh on you

465
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:18,960
Don't hold grudges

466
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:24,400
I have to thank you even more

467
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,799
Fortunately, you forced me

468
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,559
Otherwise there is no me today

469
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,119
Thank you if you want

470
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,359
You are not relying on me today

471
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,279
By yourself

472
00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:36,920
thank you

473
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,640
Thank you dear myself too

474
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:41,279
Remember

475
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:43,160
We can lose everything

476
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:45,000
Just can't lose yourself

477
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:47,359
remember

478
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:48,880
Come

479
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,319
I say two

480
00:27:57,799 --> 00:27:59,039
Are you two full?

481
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,119
I'm full I'm full

482
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,839
Do you want to eat more

483
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,079
No thanks

484
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,359
no need

485
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:10,359
Xiao Tang

486
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,000
Do you want this computer?

487
00:28:12,039 --> 00:28:13,279
Don't want me to move

488
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:14,119
Move away

489
00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:15,079
You want to like

490
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:16,720
I'll give you the computer chair

491
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,599
Thanks

492
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,599
Xiao Tang

493
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:21,200
This drinking fountain belongs to me

494
00:28:21,319 --> 00:28:22,480
Like to dismantle it yourself

495
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,119
Xiao Tang

496
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:25,279
I took these two lamps

497
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,480
Take it away

498
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:38,200
Take what you want

499
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,839
Your company

500
00:28:44,839 --> 00:28:46,440
It collapses faster than a call

501
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,000
Sister, I want to hug you

502
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Hug

503
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:54,960
Lift up

504
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,720
do not move

505
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,039
Motionless

506
00:28:58,759 --> 00:29:00,599
Sister, why are you here?

507
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:01,920
Do you miss me

508
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:03,960
You're on the hook

509
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:05,400
Going to have a

510
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,799
Talk about love

511
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,759
What's going on

512
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:14,319
Broke down

513
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:16,279
Yes sister

514
00:29:16,279 --> 00:29:17,000
What do you like

515
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,720
You take whatever

516
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,640
but

517
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:20,599
I think

518
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:21,880
It's best for you to take me away

519
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:23,880
The least valuable here

520
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,640
It's you

521
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,720
Why are you so ignorant?

522
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:28,680
I am looking for you

523
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:30,000
You say

524
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,640
How much money do you have

525
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,720
I have no cash

526
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,440
I see

527
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,039
I Alipay

528
00:29:40,039 --> 00:29:40,880
Seventy-three yuan

529
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,960
Yes i still have card

530
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,319
This

531
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,440
This one is half a million

532
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,079
But there seems to be three dollars left

533
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:53,279
This this seems to be left

534
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:54,240
More than thirty dollars

535
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,640
This is frozen

536
00:29:57,799 --> 00:29:58,720
This also doesn't work

537
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,680
correct

538
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,519
I still have it in WeChat

539
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,400
There are more than 30 yuan

540
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:07,680
Why so little

541
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:11,000
I have always been a pauper

542
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:11,960
You don't know

543
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,720
Where's your car

544
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:15,160
Arrived at my friend

545
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,119
Over a million

546
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,319
Look at this

547
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:21,720
Open a company to burn money

548
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,960
You haven't burned

549
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:25,079
Had known

550
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,319
What's wrong, sister

551
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:29,680
You are short of money

552
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,599
Yes

553
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,359
How much do you lack

554
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,880
five million

555
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,400
Trivial

556
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:37,400
What a trivial thing you are doing like this

557
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,359
I have no money

558
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:39,680
But Laoguan has

559
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:40,880
Your dad

560
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,519
Yes indeed

561
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:43,799
Yes indeed

562
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,720
You can find him to invest in this project

563
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,480
Wrap me

564
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,599
Guan Xiaotang

565
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,039
Let me tell you clearly

566
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:53,799
This is a business

567
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:55,680
Nothing else involved

568
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:01,279
You are afraid of me

569
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:02,599
Use money to coerce you with me

570
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:03,319
To shut up

571
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,039
It's ok

572
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:06,079
Doesn't exist

573
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:06,680
its me

574
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,440
I will use money at best to blackmail you

575
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,160
Be my girlfriend

576
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,000
Never let you and me

577
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:09,720
To shut up

578
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:10,640
No, both of us

579
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,880
You say I will beat you

580
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,400
You beat me again, beat me, beat me

581
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:16,440
Beat me beat me

582
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,160
I don't believe it today

583
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:17,839
What are you doing

584
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,200
broom

585
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,880
Broom, where is the broom

586
00:31:22,039 --> 00:31:22,839
Broom me

587
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,240
Need to take off pants

588
00:31:24,279 --> 00:31:25,319
Let you hit me

589
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:26,640
Wait a while wait a while

590
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,359
You spank first

591
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:28,119
You spank me first

592
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:29,160
I call my dad

593
00:31:30,279 --> 00:31:31,160
Don't always slap your face

594
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,960
It's okay, just hit and hit

595
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,720
The user you dialed

596
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,319
Temporarily unavailable

597
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:37,000
Don't answer the phone

598
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,000
Sorry

599
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,400
I'll call Miying

600
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:43,119
You hit

601
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:44,519
It's okay it's okay it's okay

602
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:45,880
You don't hit me

603
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,680
Hello, Miyoung

604
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:49,839
What about my dad

605
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,960
okay, I get it

606
00:31:58,119 --> 00:31:58,759
Fight or not

607
00:31:58,759 --> 00:31:59,960
I've been lying here for a long time

608
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,160
If you can't fight, you can leave

609
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:05,160
where to

610
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,799
Go to Laoguan for money

611
00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:10,599
Go

612
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:11,440
You see it beautiful

613
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,160
let go

614
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:35,039
As long as your dad

615
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:36,319
Can give me thirty minutes

616
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:38,640
I can convince him to invest

617
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,200
Not so troublesome

618
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,359
Tell him it will definitely make money

619
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:43,400
He must vote

620
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:45,599
I'm really not sure

621
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:47,839
That's okay

622
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,440
Isn't it five million?

623
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:50,400
to him

624
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,119
Don't lose to you

625
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:52,400
I have to blame others

626
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,359
Your dad often loses money

627
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,200
Last year

628
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,799
Seems to be normal

629
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:00,839
Above

630
00:33:15,799 --> 00:33:16,559
Meiying

631
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:17,359
How did you come

632
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:19,039
I am looking for my dad in a hurry

633
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,359
He invited people to eat in there

634
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,279
I will bring this wine in first

635
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,799
How much did he drink

636
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:29,559
four people

637
00:33:29,559 --> 00:33:30,839
Have drunk four bottles

638
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,319
Now this is the fifth bottle

639
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,240
Then you send it in

640
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,000
sit

641
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:38,440
I know his drinking capacity

642
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:39,599
Let him drink another bottle

643
00:33:39,799 --> 00:33:41,359
100% of your thing

644
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,559
give

645
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:46,759
Wine is coming wine is coming

646
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:48,039
it is good

647
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,640
Why is this wine again

648
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:51,960
I'm happy to drink with elder brother

649
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,440
Laoguan

650
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,599
You have a bad stomach

651
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:57,839
Drink it again, it's going to bleed again

652
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,720
Can drink with elder brother

653
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:01,200
Don't talk about stomach bleeding

654
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,359
It turns out that your dad also has stomach problems

655
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:04,680
Can't drink

656
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,920
He has stomach problems

657
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:09,679
I do not know

658
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,880
Come, come, brother

659
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,639
I will do it first

660
00:34:16,599 --> 00:34:17,159
President Wang

661
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:18,519
You can drink more today

662
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,199
thanks, thanks

663
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:20,920
Not bad right

664
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:23,079
That one

665
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:24,920
Bank loan

666
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,679
I have to trouble you a lot to help

667
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,679
Laoguan

668
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,760
It's not that big brother won't help you

669
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,480
It's really you

670
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:35,400
Company can't make it

671
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,119
You and the company

672
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:39,000
Be accommodating

673
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,199
Yes, brother

674
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:41,079
You bother

675
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:49,558
How about you first

676
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:50,880
The 30 million in front is repaid

677
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:51,880
These five million

678
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,320
I will approve you immediately

679
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,559
If you lend me this five million

680
00:34:57,719 --> 00:34:58,880
Let me turn around

681
00:34:59,239 --> 00:35:00,599
Don't say the thirty million

682
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:02,159
50 million just before that

683
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:04,000
I can definitely pay it back

684
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,960
Can't make it

685
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:08,280
Big brother

686
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:11,800
Let me be honest with you

687
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,280
Now my company

688
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,719
Just a breath away

689
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:18,480
Just let me catch my breath

690
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:19,719
I can do anything

691
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:21,400
Really not good

692
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,880
These five million won't work

693
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,599
That that

694
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:26,679
Then three million

695
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:28,440
two millions

696
00:35:29,639 --> 00:35:30,519
As long as you can give me

697
00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:31,760
Loan this money

698
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,519
My company will survive

699
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:36,840
Brother, I beg you

700
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,239
Laoguan for decades

701
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,079
Who have you asked for?

702
00:35:45,159 --> 00:35:46,400
I will kneel for you

703
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,800
Laoguan Laoguan Laoguan

704
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,400
Laoguan

705
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:55,280
Woke up

706
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,119
Get up

707
00:35:56,679 --> 00:35:58,280
OK, I promise you

708
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,599
thanks, thanks

709
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:01,000
accepted

710
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,159
Get up, laoguan

711
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:03,199
Thank you brother thank you

712
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:04,679
Thanks big brother

713
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:05,800
You really

714
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,800
Saved the lives of our family

715
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,519
Xiao Tang

716
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:37,360
I

717
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,679
I always thought he was easy

718
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,679
Actually it's not easy for anyone

719
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:47,360
My Father

720
00:36:49,719 --> 00:36:51,000
For millions

721
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,599
I knelt down

722
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,519
I still burn money like this

723
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,039
I really i really

724
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,679
It's useless if you beat yourself to death

725
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,920
Guan Xiaotang, look at me

726
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,239
You look at me

727
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:18,400
Guan Xiaotang

728
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,039
Now is the hardest time for your dad

729
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:24,400
If you want to help him

730
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,519
Just walk in generously

731
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,119
Toast some uncles

732
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:32,960
You have to be sensible

733
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:34,519
Very capable and confident

734
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:37,400
Let uncle see

735
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:39,320
Someone in your family

736
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:41,119
Business has hope and future

737
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,000
I can get the money I borrowed

738
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,159
They readily lend money to your dad

739
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,239
But your business

740
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:54,119
You don't care about me

741
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:55,719
Sister, I have a way

742
00:38:01,719 --> 00:38:02,400
This one

743
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,519
This should be worth some money

744
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,559
Should be able to help your dad

745
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,559
sister

746
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,960
Sorry

747
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,039
Xiao Tang

748
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,360
If you can accompany your dad this time

749
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,559
Get over this difficulty

750
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:25,199
You are truly mature

751
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:32,960
Then at that time

752
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,039
Would you still consider me

753
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:40,760
Your family is in turmoil

754
00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:42,639
Don't love your children

755
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:45,480
Now your dad needs you

756
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,480
Hurry in

757
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:52,400
Wipe away tears

758
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,400
dad

759
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:06,679
uncle

760
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,880
Come come

761
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,880
Come here my son

762
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:11,880
How much did you drink

763
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:12,519
Call Uncle Li

764
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:13,400
Li Shu Li Shu

765
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:14,920
Come, my respect

766
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:15,679
Where is Li Siyu

767
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,920
Already inside

768
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,000
Li Siyu

769
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:23,000
boss Zhang

770
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,159
Position of Group Sales Director

771
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:26,280
Keep it for you

772
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,920
Conditions are the same

773
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,760
Thank you Mr. Zhang for your love

774
00:39:30,559 --> 00:39:31,199
how about it

775
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:32,599
When do you plan to start

776
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:33,880
Come, come and sit

777
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:40,679
boss Zhang

778
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:43,320
I have something else to come today

779
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,719
What's the matter

780
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:47,920
I think

781
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,440
Borrow money from you

782
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:52,400
How much to borrow

783
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,599
five million

784
00:39:55,079 --> 00:39:55,840
doing what

785
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,239
Research and development of membraneless batteries

786
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:01,320
That's the one

787
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:02,599
Gao Zhengdao

788
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:04,360
The one who has been doing research

789
00:40:05,159 --> 00:40:06,440
You also know him

790
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,159
I heard about it

791
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,199
But this project

792
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:12,920
Seems to have been

793
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,079
Not going well

794
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,840
The prospects are not too optimistic

795
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,199
All funds are withdrawn

796
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,639
Does this matter

797
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:21,679
So i came to you

798
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,760
You need to know

799
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,039
Everyone is not optimistic about this project

800
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,719
Everyone is optimistic

801
00:40:31,719 --> 00:40:33,320
It's not my turn

802
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:37,599
boss Zhang

803
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,360
Five million for a year

804
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:42,960
I'll pay you 5.8 million when it's due

805
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:45,960
Then

806
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,320
What do you use as collateral

807
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,719
All my assets including the car

808
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,039
All cast in

809
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:56,360
Called on that item

810
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,920
Now is a negative generation

811
00:40:59,719 --> 00:41:01,519
There is nothing to mortgage

812
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,639
If there is no mortgage

813
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:06,320
This matter

814
00:41:06,679 --> 00:41:07,960
I really can't accept it

815
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,199
in case

816
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,599
I use myself as a mortgage

817
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,199
what do you mean

818
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,880
Didn't you always want me

819
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,920
Join Qiji?

820
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:26,000
If one year expires

821
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,480
I can't pay the money yet

822
00:41:28,039 --> 00:41:29,639
I joined Qiji Group

823
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,559
Work for you for ten years for free

824
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,559
What you said

825
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,639
I really can't refuse

826
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,119
but

827
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,360
I can only lend you three million

828
00:41:53,639 --> 00:41:55,400
Four million in a year

829
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:57,880
Also use you

830
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,800
Ten-year labor contract as mortgage

831
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,360
Can you accept it

832
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,920
Zhang Yanzhou

833
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:07,000
You old fox

834
00:42:07,719 --> 00:42:08,920
You know

835
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:15,559
I accept

836
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:16,719
Deal

837
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:17,880
Deal

838
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:23,480
Brother, I'm not free this afternoon

839
00:42:23,719 --> 00:42:24,519
Correct

840
00:42:25,679 --> 00:42:27,159
Cancel the appointment

841
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,239
See you next time

842
00:42:34,039 --> 00:42:34,800
Advance

843
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,119
President Su

844
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:38,079
Have a courier for you

845
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:39,400
Just put it on the table for me

846
00:42:39,719 --> 00:42:40,320
it is good

847
00:43:03,159 --> 00:43:04,679
What is it

848
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:20,760
Sorry
