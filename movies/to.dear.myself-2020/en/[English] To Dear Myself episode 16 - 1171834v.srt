00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,050
[Episode 16]

4
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,850
It's true. Right in front of me,

5
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:41,110
Sister Ziru called the Resources Department

6
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:44,850
and figured out the annual salary and position. All you have to do is show up.

7
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,450
Wait, stop talking.

8
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:49,800
Let me calm down and digest this information.

9
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:58,820
There are so many talented people out there, why did she pick me?

10
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:02,650
Because you're talented.

11
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:07,520
Be honest. How did you beg her?

12
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,130
Or what promise did you make her?

13
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,280
Nothing.

14
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,780
Sister Ziru always admired your talent.

15
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:19,010
All I did was say that you were out of work, and she immediately offered to take you.

16
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:20,630
It was really that easy?

17
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:24,020
Yiming, rest assured. Sister Ziru's not an idiot.

18
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:27,480
If you were really talentless, she wouldn't take you.

19
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,820
Still, I've only met her twice.

20
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,850
Well, you have an impressive resume.

21
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:37,360
Impressive resume? I've sent that exact resume to fifty different companies.

22
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,670
It barely got any recognition, how come suddenly—

23
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:43,320
Not every single director has a good eye.

24
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,630
Not every unemployed job seeker

25
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,880
has a girlfriend like you.

26
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,510
I didn't do anything!

27
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,580
Siyu, thank you.

28
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,020
Don't thank me.

29
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,190
I did it for myself, too.

30
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:22,110
Yiming, I don't want you to leave.

31
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:24,570
I don't want to have a long-distance relationship with you.

32
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:27,570
I don't want to face an uncertain future.

33
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,680
I don't either.

34
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:54,450
Huizhong, I'm sorry.

35
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:59,650
It's fine, Senior Brother. I know that you did your best.

36
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:03,320
I told many of my friends about your situation.

37
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,460
They are interested in your ability and qualifications.

38
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:10,730
Don't worry about finding a job.

39
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,170
Senior Brother, thank you.

40
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:19,090
I... don't want to work anymore.

41
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:22,310
Then, what are you planning to do?

42
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:30,170
Today, Mengmeng's teacher called me and scolded me.

43
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:34,390
Said I was unqualified to be a parent.

44
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:39,950
These teachers really...

45
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:43,010
I really am a failure.

46
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,510
I worked at the company for 13 years.

47
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,520
Eventually, I got kicked out.

48
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,480
I brought up a

49
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,940
proud disciple,

50
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:00,290
yet she defeated me.

51
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:03,970
I had a son...

52
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:07,140
who comes in last on every test.

53
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:12,660
Don't be too disappointed. People like Li Siyu

54
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,010
can't be happy for too long.

55
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:21,570
Lubao and Li Siyu

56
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,640
can do whatever they want.

57
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:31,680
I just want to find a job that will give me more freedom.

58
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,150
I don't care how much money I make.

59
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:39,390
This way, I can protect Mengmeng every day,

60
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:42,450
and help him with his health.

61
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:45,030
I can also help him improve his grades.

62
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,460
That's good, too.

63
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:57,090
I need to go. Mengmeng is taking an afterschool class. It's almost ending. I need to pick him up.

64
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,250
- I'm leaving. 
 - Okay.

65
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,550
Bye.

66
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:32,670
Right now, even Wei Yayun can order me around.

67
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:35,520
I really have fallen from grace.

68
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:38,760
I don't have it good either.

69
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,990
I graduated during the 985 project.

70
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:44,800
Always helping others pour water and tea.

71
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,660
Mr. Wu, are our lives really going to be like this forever?

72
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,630
Of course not. We still have opportunities.

73
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:54,780
Opportunities? Where?

74
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,760
With my experience,

75
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:02,710
all bids have some dirty tricks.

76
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:05,930
Liu Yang deliberately kicked us out

77
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:09,630
because he thought we were in his way.

78
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:12,010
But we've already been kicked out.

79
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:15,920
Even if there was stuff happening behind the scenes, we still wouldn't know.

80
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,310
If there's nothing going on behind the scenes,

81
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:26,010
then start thinking outside the box.

82
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,040
I have a list of all the companies that have sent in pre-review documents.

83
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,390
Look them up.

84
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:36,850
I'm sure one of these companies has something to do with Liu Yang.

85
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,210
How do I look them up?

86
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:41,250
The internet is so up-to-date nowadays, do I have to teach you?

87
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,860
I feel very honored to be able to join the Tianye Group.

88
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:01,520
I'm also very happy to become colleagues with everyone standing here.

89
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,590
I have hope that in future days, the Planning Department

90
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:08,070
will become Tianye's most important department.

91
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,890
We trust that under Director Chen's supervision,

92
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:13,220
the Planning Department's quality of work will become even better.

93
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,110
Thank you.

94
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:17,640
Director Chen, your office is in here.

95
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,220
Everyone, sit.

96
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,880
Director Chen, is there anything else you need?

97
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,410
Not at the moment.

98
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:30,950
Then I will go back to my office.

99
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,560
Thank you.

100
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:23,670
[Chen Yiming] 
 [Planning Department]

101
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:37,770
Why did you take me out to the middle of nowhere?

102
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:40,080
What are you doing?

103
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,480
You also got me drunk.

104
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,090
What is your intention?

105
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:50,600
Tell me. Today, I'm happy. I'll do what you say.

106
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,830
I don't really have any intentions.

107
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:55,470
I just want to take a walk with you.

108
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,400
Walk?

109
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,920
Be careful!

110
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,290
Why are you so slow? Hurry!

111
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:13,590
There's fireworks!

112
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,780
Let's celebrate!

113
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,290
Okay.

114
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:33,590
Congratulations on finding your place in society again.

115
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:39,820
Congratulations on achieving your dream of becoming the sales director.

116
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:45,600
Then in the future, every time a dream comes true,

117
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,550
we will light a firework to celebrate.

118
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,540
Sure.

119
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:54,300
- So should we pick a bigger one today? 
 - Sure!

120
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:18,520
♫  Your voice is light and soft  ♫

121
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:23,200
♫  Forms the love I want  ♫

122
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,290
♫  Your eyes are innocent and clear  ♫

123
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:31,150
♫  Like the ripples in the middle of a lake  ♫

124
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:35,240
♫  The world suddenly became quiet  ♫

125
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,610
A drone!

126
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:39,110
♫  As if someone pressed pause  ♫

127
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:45,660
♫  How much luck did I exchange in order to meet you  ♫

128
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,780
Help me hold this.

129
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:49,980
♫  Your hair is fanned out in the wind  ♫

130
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:54,690
♫  That is the forest I want to be lost in  ♫

131
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:57,740
♫  It's the beautiful scenery that I want to go to  ♫

132
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:02,620
♫  It's all hidden in your eyes  ♫

133
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:05,590
♫  I want to give all of me to you  ♫

134
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:10,550
Siyu, your husband is here for a job.

135
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:17,000
♫  We're getting closer, so let me fall in love  ♫

136
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:22,370
♫  In this lifetime, I just want to tightly hold your hand  ♫

137
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:25,790
♫  As we slowly walk and slowly feel  ♫

138
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:29,280
♫  With each breath, all our vows ♫

139
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:33,690
♫ remain as time goes by  ♫

140
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:36,540
Actually I should have assumed office earlier,

141
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,230
but I wanted to give you a better me

142
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:42,790
and a more assured future.

143
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:45,740
So I delayed for so long.

144
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:51,130
After going through so many difficulties,

145
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:55,120
to myself, to you,

146
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,860
to us,

147
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,940
I have a deeper understanding.

148
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:04,110
So Siyu don't worry,

149
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:06,460
you can rely on me.

150
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:10,540
I will work hard.

151
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:16,340
I will prove with the rest of my life that I am the best.

152
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,930
You have the best taste as well.

153
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:25,430
♫  In this lifetime, I just want to tightly hold your hand  ♫

154
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,720
♫  As we slowly walk and slowly feel  ♫

155
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:32,340
♫  With each breath, all our vows ♫

156
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:36,540
♫ remain as time goes by  ♫

157
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:41,240
♫  In this lifetime, I just want to tightly hold your hand  ♫

158
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:46,560
♫  As we slowly walk and slowly feel  ♫

159
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:51,610
♫  To spend every day and night with you  ♫

160
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:57,550
♫  Just want to tightly hold  your hand ♫

161
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:00,250
You just proposed.

162
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:03,010
I just proposed.

163
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:48,520
Fantastic. Great! I'm so happy!

164
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,660
What's wrong?

165
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:05,580
Nothing.

166
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:09,280
Is it because of this painting?

167
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,240
Xiao Ling,

168
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:25,600
I've been looking for you.

169
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:28,700
I've been here all the time.

170
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:31,340
Ten years ago,

171
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:35,340
when I saw this painting for the first time, I cried as well.

172
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,940
Many people didn't understand why.

173
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,840
But only I know...

174
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,650
what touched me.

175
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,600
Xiao Ling,

176
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,100
we are the same group of people.

177
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:53,620
Be my girlfriend.

178
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:58,360
You understand me. I also understand you.

179
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:03,400
This exhibition includes clothing,

180
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:07,190
sculpture, fine arts, and interactive installation, etc.

181
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:10,480
What you see is the change and influence that social media nowadays has made

182
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,290
to people's thoughts

183
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:15,830
and behaviors.

184
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:18,810
Hi, Danny!

185
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:22,490
Hi, Bruce.

186
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,390
Long time no see.

187
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:28,780
Your exhibition is great.  It's really nice.

188
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:32,770
I like all the paintings and I also like all the history.

189
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:36,330
- You like this? 
 - Yes. 
 [Add story]

190
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,460
Nice.

191
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:41,730
Every moment is certain.

192
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:46,420
But every next moment is uncertain.

193
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:57,420
Where did you go to act today?

194
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:00,010
Who are you sending a message to?

195
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:05,060
See? The top of that house.

196
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:08,450
I told you it was the apartment of a famous collector.

197
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:11,640
Look, it's so low key.

198
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,980
It is very low key.

199
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:21,800
Liu Yang, Sister Siyu accepted Brother Yiming's proposal.

200
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,840
Great! Congratulations to them.

201
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,980
I want to invite Sister Siyu and Brother Yiming

202
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,380
over for dinner.

203
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,120
Would you come to join as well? 
 - I'm in a meeting.

204
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,550
This is magical.

205
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:52,660
I still can't believe it.

206
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,030
You can't regret now.

207
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:00,680
Do we really need to get married?

208
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:08,050
You think it can be fake?

209
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,760
Yiming,

210
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,520
actually I don't know

211
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,620
how to be a wife.

212
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:23,820
You are saying like I know how to be a husband.

213
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,860
This is our first time getting married.

214
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:29,010
But I believe,

215
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,510
we can make it.

216
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:36,610
We learn together and work hard together.

217
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:38,500
Explore together.

218
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:45,120
What are we going to do next?

219
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:52,640
The next step is a realistic one.

220
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:57,930
Is it to discuss

221
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:00,510
bride price and dowry?

222
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,930
To discuss the house.

223
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,730
Siyu,

224
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:10,640
I've saved about ¥1,000,000.

225
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,380
This is just enough for the first payment of a two-room apartment.

226
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,570
Let's buy a 3-room apartment.

227
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:18,680
We have a room and our kid has a room.

228
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,610
In case Zhizhi and Xiao Ling fight with their hubands,

229
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:24,600
they run away from their home, we prepare one room for them as well.

230
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:30,170
But a 3-room apartment with a good location

231
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,290
are around ¥5,000,000.

232
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:35,500
I don't have enough money for the first payment.

233
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,050
I have ¥500,000.

234
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:41,220
No. Your money is your money.

235
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,540
How can I use your money?

236
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:47,500
How can you just fancy my looks,

237
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,360
but don't fancy my money?

238
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,250
Siyu,

239
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:59,090
we've been together for so many years.

240
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,070
You sacrificed a lot.

241
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:06,660
But if the first payment of our apartment

242
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:09,240
also needs you,

243
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,760
I really can't accept it.

244
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:18,870
Chen Yiming, let me tell you. Either you accept my money and beauty together,

245
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:21,360
or you get nothing.

246
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,900
What are you doing?

247
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,330
What are you doing? What do you want to do?

248
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:29,960
It's just ¥500,000.

249
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,880
You're going to be working for me for the rest of your life.

250
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,820
Actually, it's me who got lucky.

251
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,150
Siyu.

252
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:42,850
You can also entertain people.

253
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:10,860
I heard a new director came to your department.

254
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:13,480
- He came last week. 
 - How is he?

255
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,070
- Not that great. 
 - Yet he can still be a director?

256
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:18,310
I heard that it was some leader's son-in-law.

257
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:21,840
Boss Wang had no other choice than to transfer Mr. He somewhere else

258
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,560
to give that position to him.

259
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,520
I was thinking about why Mr. He suddenly transferred away after he was doing pretty well.

260
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,440
Mr. He actually got lucky because of this mess. He went from the director of planning

261
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,860
to CEO of the branch office.

262
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,180
Director Chen.

263
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:13,470
Director Chen, you didn't go to the meeting?

264
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:16,420
- What meeting? 
 - The regular meeting every Wednesday.

265
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:19,010
Every director has to attend that meeting.

266
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:20,760
Thank you.

267
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:28,090
¥800 million takes up 20% equity.

268
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:31,660
That means that Lubao's expected worth is ¥4,000,000,000.

269
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:34,660
This price, a few years ago, would've been pretty fitting.

270
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:38,530
But now, according to the general circumstances, this price is too high.

271
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:40,520
Then how much money do you think is fitting?

272
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:45,170
According to the Finance Department's prediction model, it should be ¥3,000,000,000.

273
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:48,460
I still think that ¥3,000,000,000 is still a bit high.

274
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,090
Sorry, I didn't get the notice to attend this meeting.

275
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:03,490
Amy, next time we have a meeting,

276
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:05,960
make sure you notify Director Chen.

277
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,590
Oh, okay.

278
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:12,470
Director Chen, sit here.

279
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:15,240
No, it's fine. I'll just sit here.

280
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,360
Director Chen, your seat is here.

281
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:45,290
Director Wang, how much do you think is fitting?

282
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:47,770
Let's put that aside for now.

283
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:51,670
What's the newest news regarding the financial market?

284
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:55,160
I-Isn't today's meeting specifically about Lubao's estimated worth?

285
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,170
We're nearing our next round of negotiations.

286
00:23:57,170 --> 00:24:00,310
We have to agree on and confirm this today.

287
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,620
I got news that

288
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:16,040
the upcoming policy is mainly focusing on adjusting indirect financing.

289
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,620
What else?

290
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:27,280
Director Wang, I suddenly realized that I made an appointment with a client

291
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:31,490
to talk about the brand image strategy we will put in place in the future.

292
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:33,490
Okay. Then go ahead.

293
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:36,560
Okay. I'll be leaving.

294
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:40,360
I'm so sorry, everyone. I'm leaving.

295
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,550
Continue.

296
00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:00,990
Oh, right, even Xingxing's father liked the cookies you made.

297
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:04,280
- Really? 
 - I liked them, too. They're delicious.

298
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,120
Then I'll make more and bring them tomorrow.

299
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:10,320
Stop making cookies. Make some Napoleans. I love those.

300
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,870
- I love Napoleans as well! 
 - Aren't they good? 
 - They're also quite simple.

301
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:15,820
Okay. Then I'll make some for you.

302
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:18,840
Thank you so much, Yuwei's mom. School's out.

303
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:23,260
- They're out now. 
 - Get in a line, get in a line.

304
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:25,440
- Get in a line. 
 - Your kid...

305
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,210
That's our grandson.

306
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:30,490
Are you okay? Are you injured?

307
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:32,850
- How could you do that? 
 - Come here.

308
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:36,340
How could there be no problem? Look how big this bruise is!

309
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,560
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

310
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,550
How about we go to the hospital and check?

311
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:43,330
Of course, we have to! What if he got a concussion?

312
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:45,240
Okay, okay, grandma. I'll come with you.

313
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:48,060
Please wait a second. He has a little sister who's still young,

314
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:50,920
and when we get her, we can go together.

315
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:53,960
- No. We have to go right now! 
 - His sister is still young.

316
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,150
What do you mean young? Do you only care about your own children?

317
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:58,030
Are you just going to leave my child for dead?

318
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:01,050
- Grandma, please stop. 
 - It's fine.

319
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:04,230
- Get out! Get out! 
 - Why would you hit me?

320
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:09,520
- I didn't do anything wrong. 
 - So what if I hit you? You deserved it!

321
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,220
It's your fault you cut in and got into my business!

322
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:16,040
- Please stop. 
 - Please calm down.

323
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,440
Why did you guys grab me?

324
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,010
She was the one who hit me.

325
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:23,530
Why did you guys stop me, not her? Are we even friends?

326
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:25,510
Okay. Okay.

327
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:28,950
Come here, come here.

328
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:33,950
Yuwei's mom, we did this for your own good.

329
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:36,530
Think about it. That old lady is so old,

330
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:38,850
if you really hit her and caused her to be injured,

331
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:40,580
then you'd be in big trouble.

332
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:42,990
That's true. Even if you didn't hurt her,

333
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:44,890
if she purposefully pretended you did, then what could you do about it?

334
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:47,230
Wouldn't that also be bad? Right?

335
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:50,760
Exactly! Yes. We did it for your own good.

336
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:53,340
We just let her hit you a few extra times

337
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,700
to help her calm down.

338
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,020
Was that not it?

339
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:01,250
Do you know who her son is?

340
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:03,750
He's the principal of the international elementary school.

341
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:07,520
Do you know how many rich parents want to get into the school but can't?

342
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:12,190
The principal said that in the next three years, he would consider our preschool's kids first.

343
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:15,400
Why? Because his child is here, too.

344
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:18,900
If you hurt his mom, then he'd take his child to a different preschool.

345
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,670
This promise would be gone.

346
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:23,810
Then nobody in this preschool would be able to get into that school!

347
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:27,870
Including Yuwei. Do you get it now?

348
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:34,200
- The kids are out. 
 - Let's go. 
 - Miao Miao.

349
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,890
- Miao Miao... 
 - Xingxing.

350
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:40,690
Come here. How are you?

351
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:43,640
Yuwei's mom, don't forget to bring me Napoleans.

352
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:47,330
Don't forget about tomorrow's cookies.

353
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:50,940
I want some extras. Let's go.

354
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:55,030
Yuwei's mom, I drove today. Do you want me to take you home?

355
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:58,020
I'll be going.

356
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:06,550
Mom, what's wrong?

357
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:08,420
Mom?

358
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:12,440
Mom? Why are you crying?

359
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:17,070
Mom, are you okay?

360
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:30,990
Liu Yang.

361
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:37,750
Change this sentence for me.

362
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,780
I'm going to the restroom.

363
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:54,060
[Wife]

364
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:28,570
Hello, the number you called is temporarily unavailable.

365
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:34,610
Hello, the number you called is temporarily unavailable.

366
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:39,920
Sorry, the number you dialed is not—

367
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:10,470
Let's go home.

368
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:30,490
Hi, kid. Want to sign up for the Chinese study class?

369
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,840
Hello? Hi.

370
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,200
I saw your listings on the app.

371
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,630
I want to make an appointment to see a house.

372
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:12,020
Okay. Then we'll talk more about it on the WeChat app.

373
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,840
Okay. Bye.

374
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:39,510
- Director Wang. 
 - Director Wang.

375
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:48,530
- Yiming. 
 - Director Wang.

376
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:52,350
I want to explain what happened at the meeting today.

377
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,740
It's fine. No problem.

378
00:31:55,740 --> 00:32:00,030
Did you know that we are discussing equity financing with Lubao?

379
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:05,280
GM Pan and I have talked multiple times about Lubao's valuation.

380
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:08,940
In theory, you are the person who understands Lubao's valuation best.

381
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:12,600
However, at today's meeting, I purposefully ordered the Administration Department

382
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,750
not to tell you.

383
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:17,960
I understand.

384
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:21,420
You were worried that I would expose the company's secrets.

385
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:25,980
No. I trust your work ethic. You wouldn't leak our secrets.

386
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,010
I just didn't want to put you in a hard place.

387
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:35,660
You and Siyu. One is Tianye's executive, and another is Lubao's executive.

388
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:39,470
If Siyu asked about Tianye's strategy,

389
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:42,320
if you said it, then it would hurt the company;

390
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,950
but if you didn't, it would hurt your relationship.

391
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:48,650
So, I felt it would be better if you didn't know.

392
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:53,600
Thank you.

393
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,340
Thanks for thinking for me.

394
00:32:56,340 --> 00:33:00,900
- I hope you understand. 
 - I do. Of course, I do.

395
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:29,310
Who was doing the brand valuation for Lubao before?

396
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:32,670
Xiao Wang did it. He already left work today.

397
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:36,630
I have some backup files here.

398
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:40,620
Okay. Then please give me all of your files on Lubao.

399
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,280
Got it.

400
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:59,760
Director Chen.

401
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,560
- Are these all the files? 
 - Yes.

402
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:05,790
Good. You can leave normally. I have nothing else.

403
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:07,450
Okay.

404
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:25,940
You still haven't gone to sleep?

405
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,740
Why didn't you pick up my calls?

406
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:35,400
You called?

407
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:41,790
It doesn't say that you sent me any messages or calls.

408
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:45,890
Are you not going to ask why I called?

409
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:49,310
Tell me.

410
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,730
I want to take Yuwei

411
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:59,110
and return her to the old Blue Sky preschool.

412
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:02,630
What did you say?

413
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:06,490
I'll get the paperwork done tomorrow.

414
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:17,480
To get Yuwei out of Blue Sky and into Golden Flower,

415
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:21,310
did you forget about how hard we worked get her in? And now you want to take her back?

416
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:25,090
Then the money, time, energy,

417
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:27,530
and the kindness we took from others were all for nothing?

418
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:30,150
Even if they were for nothing, I still want to transfer her back.

419
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:33,160
Yuwei was fine at Blue Sky.

420
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:37,470
You were the one who said she needed better education and forced us to change.

421
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:39,710
Now, Yuwei is also doing fine,

422
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:42,770
yet you want to mess around again? What exactly are you trying to do?

423
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:45,440
I was wrong, okay?

424
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:48,590
I don't want Yuwei to have superior education anymore.

425
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:52,510
I just want Yuwei to be a normal kid. Is that so wrong?

426
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:56,600
What are the two of you doing this late into the night?

427
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:03,240
- Zhizhi really wants to transfer Yuwei again? 
 - Yes. It's true.

428
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,370
- What happened? 
 - I don't agree.

429
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:09,700
It doesn't matter whether or not you agree, she must go. Tomorrow.

430
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:14,770
What has gotten into you so late at night?

431
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:18,620
Yuwei has finally gotten used to the new environment at her new preschool, and you want to transfer her again?

432
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:21,910
Aren't you afraid that it will leave a shadow in her heart?

433
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:25,860
Besides, we recently paid the tuition for this trimester's class.

434
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:30,440
If we leave now, then they'll only return half of the ¥30,000 we paid.

435
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:33,630
- Then I still want to transfer. 
 - No way.

436
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:36,730
You guys only think about money.

437
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:40,910
Today, I was bullied by someone and then everyone ganged up on me.

438
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:47,330
What happened exactly?

439
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:50,120
- Mom!  Mom.
- Coming, Grandma is coming.

440
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:53,600
Yuwei, Grandma is here.

441
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,720
- Go to sleep. Go to sleep, okay? Good girl. 
 - They all banded together to bully me.

442
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:02,770
- Good girl. 
 - They even... They even said that it was for my own good.

443
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:06,830
You two, be quieter! Don't wake Yuwei up again!

444
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:13,700
I told you long ago not to hang out

445
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:16,260
with people like Miao Miao's mom.

446
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:18,240
You just wouldn't listen.

447
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:21,130
Now that Yuwei has entered Golden Flower,

448
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:24,020
you should at least let her finish the term.

449
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:27,260
As for Miao Miao's mom and the others, just don't interact with them.

450
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:29,340
Can't you think about me?

451
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:33,150
Be quiet! Be quiet!

452
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:38,410
Just because of some issues with parents, you're making Yuwei change schools?

453
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:40,410
You're making such a huge deal out of something so little!

454
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:43,380
This isn't that! I was being bullied!

455
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:46,190
Will you stop acting so fragile?

456
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:48,690
You think I'm fragile?

457
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:51,830
Fine. You're not.

458
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:55,080
I'm telling you. In life,

459
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,490
this kind of thing happens so often.

460
00:37:57,490 --> 00:38:00,730
- If you endure it, you'll get over it. 
 - I can't!

461
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:03,610
If everyone was like you, I would've resigned so many times.

462
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:06,020
Would anyone in our family still be alive?

463
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:08,160
It's not the same thing!

464
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,450
- Then tell me what it is! 
 - I...

465
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,450
Zhizhi, we're all adults.

466
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:19,150
Adults need to be able to fix their problems.

467
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:23,630
Why do we have to transfer schools all the time? What kind of family does this?

468
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:28,510
Yuwei can't stay in this preschool!

469
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:34,120
Then let me ask you. If you let Yuwei go back to Blue Sky Preschool,

470
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:36,830
and you get bullied and hurt again,

471
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:38,940
will Yuwei have to transfer again?

472
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:42,280
- No matter what, Yuwei must go. 
 - If you must transfer, then you take care of it.

473
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,200
I'm not going to bother with this anymore.

474
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:56,550
How could you not care about this big waste of money?

475
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:11,750
This... What does this mean?

476
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:13,990
Is she going up to the sky?

477
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:22,130
Yang, how about you sleep in the bedroom

478
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:24,980
- and I'll sleep on the couch? 
 - It's fine, I can sleep here.

479
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:26,650
What kind of wife is this?

480
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:30,090
- She's absolutely, absolutely— 
 - Mom.

481
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:33,030
Let me tell you!  You can't lower your head!

482
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:35,900
She needs to control her temper.

483
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:39,240
- What even— 
 - Sleep, sleep, sleep.

484
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:41,760
How is it? Do you like it?

485
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,350
Sister. Brother. This house

486
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:48,960
has many people wanting to make reservations to see it on Anjuke.

487
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,980
You should take it! Don't hesitate.

488
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:54,060
Okay. We'll continue looking.

489
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:20,680
We can discuss it later.

490
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,580
How do you like it?

491
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,680
Should we buy this one?

492
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,770
I've been looking at it for a long time on Anjuke.

493
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:39,930
I observed its real-life map, the floor plan,

494
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:42,240
and the VR video.

495
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:45,860
I think there are no problems with the location and direction.

496
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:49,220
The layout is also nice. Later, we could add some furniture

497
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:51,800
and get married right away.

498
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:55,440
Get married right away?

499
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:59,500
Wait, wait, wait. You've been thinking very actively these past few days.

500
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:03,490
- What other plans do you have? Let me prepare my heart for them. 
 - Nothing else.

501
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:05,670
I just want to buy a house.

502
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:09,070
Buying a house is a huge thing. We should be more cautious.

503
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:12,210
Cautious? Of course, I am.

504
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:14,030
Aren't I discussing it with you?

505
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:18,630
Just tell me. Are you unsatisfied with any part of this house?

506
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:23,180
Nothing, but maybe there are better ones.

507
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:29,800
Siyu, there's no perfect house on this planet.

508
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:33,000
If we live in it,

509
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,360
it will become our home.

510
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,710
I think that's the best.

511
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:41,820
You're right,

512
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:45,790
but I still think we should look at more.

513
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:47,560
I don't want to look at more.

514
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:49,850
We should just get this one. I'm tired of looking. I don't want to look.

515
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:51,690
You can't be too rash when buying houses.

516
00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:54,160
I am though. I'm so anxious to get it over with.

517
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:58,890
I just want to buy a house quickly and get married to you quickly.

518
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:10,200
What? You're regretting it?

519
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:13,060
- You don't want to get married anymore? 
 - No, no, no. That's not what I meant at all.

520
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:17,610
Then, why are you so picky about houses?

521
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:21,410
I'm not picky, I'm...

522
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:27,470
Just let me think about it longer.

523
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:48,800
- Hello? Brother Yang? 
 - Siyu, I just wanted to let you know that Lubao qualified.

524
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,230
The prequalification and sample testing are all within the requirements.

525
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:53,380
Great!

526
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:58,130
You guys should prepare to send the files.

527
00:43:58,130 --> 00:44:00,410
The next stage will be given to the expert evaluation team.

528
00:44:00,410 --> 00:44:02,100
We are only assisting

529
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:06,500
in order to avoid suspicion, it is best that we do not contact or meet each other during the process.

530
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:08,200
I understand, I understand.

531
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:13,250
Brother Yang, could you please just let me know

532
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:16,530
if Lubao's possibilities are big or not?

533
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:21,060
The only thing I can tell you is that Lubao's score is pretty high. Good luck!

534
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:22,920
Thank you!

535
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:42,000
Are you angry with me?

536
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,060
- No. 
 - You're lying.

537
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:47,900
Listen to your cold voice.

538
00:44:50,210 --> 00:44:52,710
I was wrong. I was wrong, okay?

539
00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:55,540
It's not that I don't want to get married!

540
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:58,750
I just... I've been under a lot of pressure lately,

541
00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:01,180
¥5,000,000,000 is weighing down on my brain,

542
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:03,540
and you just recently joined a new company.

543
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:08,000
I just haven't had the ability to concentrate on thinking about marriage.

544
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:13,440
At least your apology was honest.

545
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,230
Never mind. There's nothing else.

546
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:18,040
Okay.
