[To Dear Myself]

00:01:29,925 --> 00:01:31,925
[Ep5]

3
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:51,920
Sister Siyu

4
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:58,799
Sister Siyu

5
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,760
Thank you for taking me in

6
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,725
But I think I should go

7
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:09,560
Why?

8
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:14,250
As I know, president Pan scolded you because of me

9
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,093
You can go

10
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,199
But I was scolded for nothing

11
00:02:23,775 --> 00:02:26,120
I win you a chance after being scolded

12
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,875
President Pan has said, as long as you can 

13
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:30,360
sign a contract with a client within a week

14
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,240
You can end the internship and be hired offically

15
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,159
A week?

16
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,960
I can't

17
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:37,840
Lin Ling

18
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,439
I have faith in you

19
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,000
You can make it

20
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,759
I can make it

21
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:04,800
Among your clients, which one is most likely to sigh the contract?

22
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:09,039
Yoyo Rabbit

23
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:11,439
Why he didn't sign the contract in the end?

24
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:13,879
The company suddenly stopped production for transformation

25
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,575
New production line will go into operation after half a year

26
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,360
Till then, they need batteries

27
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:19,759
So you just give up?

28
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,680
I asked sister Yuan about this

29
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,950
Sister Yuan said, I just need to keep in touch with him

30
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,275
We will decide after half a year

31
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,039
Go

32
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:30,319
Where are we going?

33
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,719
Go to Yoyo Rabbit

34
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:35,840
Till have 5 months to go

35
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,599
You need to go out before you know where the opportunity is

36
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:41,759
Opportunities won't come when you wait here

37
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,360
We have to fight for them

38
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,599
Ok

39
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,080
Siyu

40
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,120
Sister Yuan

41
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,319
I want to talk to you

42
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,319
Wait for me

43
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:57,400
Ok

44
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,560
Close the door

45
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:16,639
Can you tell me in advance before you take someone in?

46
00:04:17,475 --> 00:04:20,435
Otherwise they will think we are at odds

47
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,400
You didn't tell me in advance before you 

48
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,802
took in elites like Huang Bibo, Kuaizi and Afu

49
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,959
You are still angry now?

50
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:40,075
My fault. I forgot to tell you in advance

51
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,399
I am sorry

52
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,680
No need, it's over now

53
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:47,759
All right

54
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,040
I will invite you to dinner

55
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,240
You can pick the place

56
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,480
I'll pick an expensive one

57
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:54,160
Ok

58
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:57,160
Fire Lin Ling

59
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,480
Why?

60
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,240
She is not the stuff for this

61
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,300
Why do you waste time on her?

62
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:10,100
I think she has potential in sales

63
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,480
You don't adopt my advice?

64
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:16,879
No

65
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:18,279
I just promised her I would help her 

66
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:20,175
sign a contract within a week to end her internship

67
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,399
No

68
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:22,680
Why?

69
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,120
Siyu

70
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,439
To be honest

71
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,920
I taught her for three months

72
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,759
And she had no breakthrough

73
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,040
But if you help her sign the contract within a week

74
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,199
you will insult me

75
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:39,000
Sister Yuan

76
00:05:39,725 --> 00:05:42,199
I'm not sure if Lin Ling can make it

77
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,025
But even if she signs the contract

78
00:05:44,025 --> 00:05:45,360
that's because you have laid the foundation for her

79
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,319
Others won't think so

80
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:48,920
As long as we don't mind,

81
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,839
never mind the gossips

82
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,160
Easy for you to say

83
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,879
We are team leaders now

84
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:55,240
We need to care about others' opinions

85
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,399
Sister Yuan

86
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,399
Lin Ling's father is seriously ill

87
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,120
She needs this job

88
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,399
You have many ways to help her

89
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,850
Why do you use this to insult me?

90
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:23,680
Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day

91
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,000
teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime

92
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,920
She has some foundation

93
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,720
It's a pity if she gives up now

94
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:33,025
You hurt our relationship by helping Lin Ling

95
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,079
You don't think it's a pity?

96
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:39,560
Sister Yuan

97
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,639
Do you think too much?

98
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:46,800
Siyu

99
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,600
Don't forget

100
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,079
You have promised me

101
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,399
You will be second to me

102
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,399
I don't think it will make any difference 

103
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:00,680
just because of Lin Ling, right?

104
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,639
Maybe you will help more out

105
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:11,600
Sister Yuan

106
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:14,160
I have promised you

107
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:16,199
But you still don't believe me

108
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:16,959
Take precautions against me

109
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:17,920
What's the point of this?

110
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,920
Li Siyu

111
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:20,680
Think with your conscience

112
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:22,399
Will you have today without me?

113
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:24,034
I just ask you a little favor

114
00:07:24,034 --> 00:07:25,079
But you say one thing and do another

115
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:26,399
What should I think of you?

116
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:27,879
When do I say one thing and do another?

117
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:29,040
Then fire her now

118
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:32,440
Hello

119
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:33,519
Hello

120
00:08:34,475 --> 00:08:36,639
Is this Dayu investment company?

121
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,639
Yes

122
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,000
Hello, I...

123
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,159
Days ago, I sent an email cover letter

124
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,799
But I got no reply

125
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:46,440
So...

126
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,679
I hope you can check it for me

127
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,039
No reply, it means you are eliminated

128
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:56,759
Then I want to ask about the reason

129
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:58,039
I don't know

130
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:00,679
Thank...

131
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:21,480
Hello

132
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:23,080
What are you doing?

133
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,519
Meeting

134
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,960
Are you ok?

135
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:31,720
I'm fine

136
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:36,960
I just didn't have a good talk with the client

137
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,240
What's the matter?

138
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,450
Nothing

139
00:10:41,925 --> 00:10:43,925
I just ask casually

140
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,519
Why are you all sitting there?

141
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,200
It's been two weeks, you still didn't fix it

142
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,559
So disgraceful

143
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,320
Sales depend on legs

144
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,799
In all, go to grab clients

145
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:14,519
Grab clients

146
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,240
Here

147
00:11:39,925 --> 00:11:41,799
I didn't finish the medicine you gave me last time

148
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:43,519
Keep it just in case

149
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:44,720
Pay attention to your stomach

150
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:56,480
Lin Ling

151
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:57,559
Come here

152
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,279
Sister Siyu

153
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:44,440
Lin Ling

154
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:47,480
Sorry

155
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,399
Sister Siyu

156
00:12:51,975 --> 00:12:54,200
Go through the resignation procedures in HR department

157
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,039
Sister Siyu

158
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:57,519
You promised me you would help me

159
00:12:57,639 --> 00:12:58,759
I take my words back, ok?

160
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:00,650
I break my promise, ok?

161
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:02,600
Sister Siyu

162
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,440
Stop it, go out

163
00:13:39,225 --> 00:13:40,900
You are a workaholic

164
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,519
Why are you here now?

165
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:47,080
I don't want to work today

166
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:48,320
What happened?

167
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,080
All about the office story

168
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,320
You should watch Empresses in the Palace

169
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,399
Then you won't have these troubles

170
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,039
Well

171
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,918
Help me say sorry to Chen Yiming

172
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:07,919
I showed no respect to his friend Lei

173
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:13,875
Lei Haowen likes bragging

174
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,360
An egoist man

175
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:17,480
But he is nice

176
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:18,440
Stop it

177
00:14:19,075 --> 00:14:21,950
I am so curious that Chen Yiming would have a friend like him

178
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:30,791
Chen Yiming is very strange recently

179
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:38,519
He told me he went to see clients

180
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,320
But I didn't see one

181
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,759
Why are you here alone?

182
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:42,559
Where is the client?

183
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:44,480
He just left

184
00:14:47,925 --> 00:14:51,440
And he is preoccupied

185
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:55,080
He checked the phone behind my back a lot

186
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,519
Does he have an affair?

187
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:03,480
Impossible

188
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,925
Lanke did all these when he had an affair

189
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:07,919
Chen Yiming won't

190
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:09,879
Why do you trust Chen Yiming so much?

191
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,559
If we don't have the basic trust,

192
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:13,720
why does he make a proposal?

193
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:15,639
Let me tell you

194
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:19,559
You can't take it lightly just because he makes a proposal

195
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:21,919
Actually he didn't make one

196
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,200
All because of you

197
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:24,639
Don't scapegoat me

198
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:26,919
All because you have gamophobia

199
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:34,240
After that, he didn't mention the proposal again

200
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:37,000
So weird

201
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:42,925
You shilly-shally all along

202
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,759
Just ask him

203
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:46,080
How?

204
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:47,440
Chen Yiming

205
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,159
When will you make a proposal again?

206
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,840
You are such a rookie in love

207
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,240
You think yourself as love expert

208
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:57,581
At least I see more two-timers than you do

209
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,120
Let me tell you

210
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,450
Some men are womanizers

211
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:03,720
They are lurking around all the time

212
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:05,960
Answer it

213
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:14,480
Xiao Jia

214
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:15,519
Sister

215
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,900
How to quote when I talk to Alade company?

216
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,759
Give them the quote of our senior clients

217
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:23,720
Ok, bye, sister

218
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,720
Well

219
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,400
Did Lin Ling go through the procedure?

220
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:31,600
Lin Ling?

221
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:33,519
She goes to Yoyo Rabbit

222
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:36,519
Why does she go to Yoyo Rabbit?

223
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,720
No idea

224
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:48,879
You are leaving now?

225
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,240
I have work to do

226
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,175
You need to keep an eye on Chen Yiming

227
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:54,759
Showcase

228
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,080
What about the booth?

229
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,840
At least you have a red carpet, right?

230
00:16:58,125 --> 00:17:00,600
Who will use the carpet of this kind color for exhibition?

231
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,720
Where are you now?

232
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,440
Come...

233
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,120
So, will you come?

234
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:03,759
You have promised you would come at that point

235
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:04,680
See the backboard 

236
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:06,759
The logo

237
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,240
Where's my Yoyo Rabbit logo?

238
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:12,319
Let me tell you

239
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:13,925
We have invited the leaders and media

240
00:17:13,925 --> 00:17:15,675
Even the dealers are here

241
00:17:15,675 --> 00:17:17,359
You all ruined it now

242
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,759
So will you open the exhibition tomorrow?

243
00:17:21,358 --> 00:17:22,038
What were you saying?

244
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:23,598
What were you two talking about?

245
00:17:23,598 --> 00:17:24,439
Come, tell us

246
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,279
Tell me what to do

247
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:30,440
Lin Ling

248
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:30,920
Sister Siyu

249
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,119
Mr. Jiang, calm down

250
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,720
Why are you here?

251
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:36,240
What's going on?

252
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,240
They will have a dealer conference tomorrow

253
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,750
But they found an unreliable PR company

254
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,880
Now it's a mess

255
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,200
What are you doing now?

256
00:17:46,175 --> 00:17:48,400
I am helping...

257
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,039
I fired you

258
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:51,200
What are you doing here?

259
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,640
Sister Siyu

260
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,799
I want to fight for the last time

261
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,359
You have no chance

262
00:17:58,359 --> 00:18:00,262
You have told you we can't have opportunities by waiting

263
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:01,640
We need to fight for them

264
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,960
You will do everything I say?

265
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,880
Yes

266
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:09,375
Because only you tell me I can make it

267
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,319
I know I am fired

268
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:20,000
But before leaving, I want to prove myself

269
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:21,599
I can make it

270
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:22,559
What? Arrive tomorrow?

271
00:18:22,825 --> 00:18:24,559
Why do you tell me till now?

272
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:28,375
Ok, I get it

273
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:35,319
You can't set the tables and chairs

274
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:36,279
No guest list

275
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:37,240
You can't arrange the seats

276
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,519
Is there anything you can do?

277
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:39,880
What about the booth?

278
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,799
I told you to arrange it a month ago

279
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:42,359
Zhizhi

280
00:18:42,706 --> 00:18:43,775
I need the booth when we held the exhibition 

281
00:18:43,775 --> 00:18:44,519
at the beginning of the year

282
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:45,480
You are good for nothing

283
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,160
Great

284
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,039
I need it now

285
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,519
You help me go through the application process

286
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,680
Thanks

287
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,039
Xiao Jia

288
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,640
Call everyone to come to help Yoyo Rabbit

289
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:00,519
Ok, sister

290
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,160
Everyone, listen

291
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:05,599
Sister Siyu called me just now

292
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,640
Later all of us need to go to Yoyo Rabbit

293
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,599
To help Lin Ling

294
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,480
This is an exhibition

295
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:12,119
You all know what you should do, right?

296
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:14,279
You know what to bring right?

297
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:14,960
Yes

298
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:15,599
Let's go

299
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:16,400
Bring the LED screen

300
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,000
Please come in

301
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,160
Sister Yuan

302
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,319
You leave Yoyo rabbit to me, right?

303
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:22,839
Why it goes to Lin Ling?

304
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,079
It can't be

305
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,160
You guys, get in my car

306
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:25,640
Ok

307
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,880
And put things in that car

308
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,960
I sent you Yoyo Rabbit's address

309
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,599
Hurry

310
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,359
Hurry

311
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,440
Be careful

312
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:40,319
Sister Yuan

313
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,599
Li Siyu

314
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,079
Yoyo Rabbit is Liu Jie's client

315
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:44,200
Why is Lin Ling making a trouble?

316
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,240
Yoyo Rabbit belongs to Lin Ling all along

317
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,720
After Lin Ling was fired, I told Liu Jie to take it over

318
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,525
Lin Ling was not formally fired

319
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:54,400
It still belongs to Lin Ling in company's dossier

320
00:19:55,599 --> 00:20:00,000
Li Siyu, don't forget how I taught you in the beginning

321
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,720
Sister Yuan

322
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:05,200
I did not forget

323
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:08,599
What I am doing now is what you taught me

324
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:09,799
What?

325
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:13,175
In the beginning, I had no sales performance 

326
00:20:13,175 --> 00:20:14,559
for two consecutive months

327
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,575
You didn't despise me and taught me hand by hand

328
00:20:16,575 --> 00:20:18,640
So I found confidence and breakthrough

329
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:23,125
It teach Lin Ling just like the way you taught me

330
00:20:36,775 --> 00:20:38,176
Sister Yuan, what did she say?

331
00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:42,279
Forget it

332
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:43,960
No

333
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:46,200
I said it and I mean it

334
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,480
You fired her and she took her in

335
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:51,000
Now she grabs your client

336
00:20:51,425 --> 00:20:53,319
She is turning against you

337
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:54,920
Go out

338
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:12,960
Where's Siyu?

339
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,720
In there

340
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:16,039
Hurry

341
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:16,960
I will wait for you inside

342
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:19,640
Lin Ling

343
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,359
Check the guest list and seats

344
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:21,960
Ok, sister

345
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,559
Xiao Jia

346
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,119
You will be responsible for printing and placement

347
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:24,680
Ok

348
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,559
Xiao Tian

349
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:26,119
Yes

350
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,480
You will handle the banners

351
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,039
Ok

352
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:29,960
Xiao Wu

353
00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:31,720
Get the LED lights

354
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,519
Ok

355
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,640
You two

356
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,880
Help them with stereo 

357
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,359
You three, come here

358
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,400
Come with me

359
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:45,279
You are from a PR company?

360
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,160
We are from Lubao company

361
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:49,200
Mr. Jiang, this is our manager Li

362
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,000
Manager Li, this is Mr. Jiang

363
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,640
Mr. Jiang

364
00:21:53,025 --> 00:21:55,480
Lin Ling told me, your company is in a problem

365
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,640
So we are here to help you

366
00:21:57,079 --> 00:21:57,839
Do not worry

367
00:21:58,075 --> 00:22:00,000
We are not a professional PR company

368
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:02,960
But I have organized all Lubao's dealer activities

369
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,675
I can guarantee you can hold a successful activity tomorrow

370
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,319
Manager Li, right?

371
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:09,880
What I want to tell you is

372
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,775
Our company has ho plans to order batteries in the next six months

373
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,359
It's ok

374
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,359
We have no plan even after half a year

375
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:19,000
Mr. Jiang

376
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,325
I will help you today no matter you buy or not

377
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,559
Go

378
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:29,240
Hello

379
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,200
Hello, Liu Yang

380
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:31,480
When will you come back?

381
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:32,759
I have a little work

382
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:33,519
I will go back soon

383
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:34,880
Come back early

384
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,480
I need to go out later

385
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,559
I can't leave Yuwei at home alone

386
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:40,000
Where are you going?

387
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,720
I have told you

388
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,275
I have a meeting with Miaomiao's mom

389
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:48,596
I really don't understand why you associate with them all day?

390
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:52,680
I do this for Yuwei

391
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:56,050
Since Yuwei plays with them

392
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:58,640
she has a different vision now, you don't know?

393
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,025
I need to handle an urgent matter now

394
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,850
And I won't go home tonight

395
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:05,480
Liu Yang, hello

396
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,160
Little devil

397
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,480
Don't jump, it's dangerous

398
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:16,880
Come, sit down baby

399
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,039
Come, sit down

400
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,200
Sister Siyu

401
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,839
I got brother Yiming's revised plan

402
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:40,640
It's so great

403
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:41,480
Thank you

404
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:44,800
I'm busy now

405
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,039
That's all, bye

406
00:24:57,519 --> 00:24:58,559
Aunt Mei 

407
00:24:59,200 --> 00:24:59,960
Xiaoling

408
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,440
Can you help me take care of Yuwei for a while?

409
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,241
Me?

410
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:03,799
I'll pick her up later

411
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:04,960
But...

412
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:05,680
I am running late

413
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,359
Bye

414
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,839
Zhizhi

415
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:12,559
Come in

416
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:14,160
Aunt Mei

417
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:15,880
Close the door

418
00:25:21,079 --> 00:25:22,119
It's so great

419
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:25,960
It's a good picture 

420
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:33,720
A very rich content

421
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:39,799
Yuwei's mom is so professional

422
00:25:40,575 --> 00:25:41,839
Great

423
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:42,960
Flattered

424
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:45,440
Look

425
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,240
Our previous ones are great

426
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,000
What do you want to drink?

427
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,119
I drank too much water today

428
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:49,759
I can't drink anymore

429
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:50,400
You should order

430
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,559
Or have some snacks

431
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,559
I am on a diet recently

432
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:55,559
I can't

433
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:56,279
You should order some

434
00:25:56,279 --> 00:25:57,440
You are so thin, still want to lose weight?

435
00:25:57,839 --> 00:25:58,400
I am fat

436
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,240
Yuwei

437
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:26,119
My high heels are very expensive

438
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:28,759
All right

439
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:29,799
I won't blame you...

440
00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:31,640
I will give you some food, ok?

441
00:26:34,025 --> 00:26:35,839
I have only biscuits and juice

442
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:36,839
Do you want some?

443
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,519
Sister, look

444
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:43,799
I am painting your mouth

445
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:56,475
Zhang Zhizhi, pick up your daughter now

446
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,319
So you three still want to see it?

447
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:00,240
No need, still the same

448
00:27:00,525 --> 00:27:03,279
She caused me more than 20,000 losses

449
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:04,960
She needs to compensate me when she grows up

450
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,160
I'm going crazy

451
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,039
Sister, look

452
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:23,960
You like painting, right?

453
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:25,359
Let me teach you

454
00:27:26,599 --> 00:27:29,550
Tomorrow, Yuwei's mom and I will arrange the scene

455
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:30,319
Ok

456
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:31,839
You should split up

457
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:32,519
Ok

458
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,359
Well

459
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,160
That's all for today

460
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:37,079
Ok

461
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:38,559
Waiter, settle the bill

462
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,400
Yes

463
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:40,759
Hello, scan there

464
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:41,920
1672.5

465
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,920
Yuwei's mom

466
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,519
Pay the money

467
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,599
I paid it

468
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:55,640
Let's go first

469
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,240
I got it

470
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,599
A little sleepy

471
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,160
I paid too

472
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,839
Go...

473
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,640
Bye

474
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:31,119
Hello, Xiaoling

475
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,640
You are not at home?

476
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,599
Where are you now?

477
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,559
Ok, I am coming now

478
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,400
Zhizhi

479
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:47,039
Well

480
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:49,599
Where's Yuwei?

481
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:51,000
In the toilet

482
00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:52,720
Toilet?

483
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,480
How can you let her go to the toilet alone?

484
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,599
She needs to be independent

485
00:28:57,799 --> 00:28:59,319
What if a trafficker is lurking around?

486
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,200
No

487
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,160
Mom

488
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,880
Gu Xiaoling

489
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:34,279
What's going on?

490
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,400
Why did you do to her?

491
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,680
Mom, look

492
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:40,007
Yuwei likes it

493
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,480
Is it poisonous?

494
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,079
These are all famous brands

495
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:45,480
Very safe, don't worry

496
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,039
She is still a child

497
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,880
Mom, this

498
00:29:50,575 --> 00:29:52,400
I dropped by and had her ears pierced

499
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,200
How can you do this to Yuwei?

500
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,400
Come

501
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,319
Come

502
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:01,200
These are so pretty

503
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,599
My aunt said

504
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,920
Women should be good to ourselves

505
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:09,359
Yuwei is right

506
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,799
Gu Xiaoling, you are so ridiculous

507
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:17,480
Goodbye, aunt

508
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,440
Goodbye Yuwei

509
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:20,519
Zhang Zhizhi

510
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:22,160
Do you need me to keep an eye on Yuwei tomorrow?

511
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,559
Never

512
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,640
Hello, Haowen

513
00:31:25,225 --> 00:31:27,000
Send me an email

514
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,720
Never mind the content 

515
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,319
I just want to make sure there is no problem with my mailbox

516
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:33,640
Ok, hurry

517
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,599
Hello

518
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,119
Make a phone call

519
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:11,960
Stop talking nonsense

520
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,200
Just do as I say

521
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:14,559
Hurry

522
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:12,119
Liu Yang, drink water?

523
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,480
Let me help you

524
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,279
No, thanks

525
00:33:19,325 --> 00:33:21,119
Why all of them work overtime?

526
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,559
They can't leave before you

527
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,400
Why?

528
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:26,720
You are the team leader

529
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,880
Tell me to get off work now

530
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,839
I will go home soon

531
00:33:36,175 --> 00:33:37,839
All of you should go home now

532
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:44,559
Well

533
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:52,799
Nothing...

534
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:54,000
Go home now

535
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:01,359
See you tomorrow

536
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,319
See you tomorrow

537
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:56,239
Liu Yang, you are back

538
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:10,960
What's wrong?

539
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,719
I left Yuwei to Xiaoling

540
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:16,800
Now it becomes like this

541
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:19,775
How can you leave Yuwei to Gu Xiaoling?

542
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:22,400
You work overtime, I need to attend a meeting

543
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:24,639
I have to ask Xiaoling for help

544
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:26,480
So you still went to see them right?

545
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:29,760
Voice down

546
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:36,599
You are hungry, right?

547
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,000
I will make you a bowl of wontons

548
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:41,599
What stuffings do you want?

549
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,320
Three delicacies or cabbage?

550
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:48,920
Whatever

551
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:50,679
You don't adopt my advice anyway

552
00:35:51,559 --> 00:35:53,599
You are the head of the family

553
00:35:57,325 --> 00:35:58,760
What else do you want to eat?

554
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,519
I make it for you

555
00:36:03,639 --> 00:36:04,320
Lin Ling

556
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,000
I'll go back later

557
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
I will leave here to you

558
00:36:07,159 --> 00:36:07,840
Ok

559
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:08,800
Manager Li

560
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,159
You are here

561
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:11,000
Mr. Jiang

562
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:12,199
I want to talk to you

563
00:36:12,199 --> 00:36:12,800
Ok

564
00:36:15,425 --> 00:36:17,079
We have trained them

565
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:17,599
Ok

566
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:19,320
Flowers will arrive by 6 o'clock tomorrow morning

567
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,800
Tea and pastries will arrive by eight o'clock

568
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,275
I have left the phone numbers to secretary Wang

569
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,357
I have communicated with the moderator about the conference

570
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,225
Everyone knows his responsibility now

571
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:33,000
And plan B is ready, too

572
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,639
Thank you

573
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:36,280
Thank you so much

574
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,199
Come, please

575
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:38,360
Mr. Jiang, you are welcome

576
00:36:38,775 --> 00:36:41,225
Client's priority is our priority

577
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:46,599
The thing is our company is not your client

578
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,599
A friend, at least

579
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,950
Friends should help each other

580
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,159
Manager Wang

581
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,519
Mr. Jiang

582
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,599
Manager Wang

583
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,079
Draw up a contract right away

584
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:04,325
Our company need to order half a million batteries

585
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,199
Tell finance department to prepare advance payment

586
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:11,475
Our production line won't operate until the second half of this year

587
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:14,039
Mr. Jiang, you don't need to do so

588
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:16,679
You have said, we are friends

589
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,400
I see you as friends

590
00:37:19,075 --> 00:37:21,960
I want to show my gratitude

591
00:37:22,375 --> 00:37:24,199
It's a little sincerity of our company

592
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:24,920
But...

593
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,519
Yes

594
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,960
But sincerity must be based on reality

595
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:33,159
well, you don't believe in my strength?

596
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,440
Thank you Mr. Jiang

597
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,360
Ok

598
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,679
Ok

599
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:40,360
Then let's hit the iron while it's hot

600
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,480
Lin Ling

601
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,559
You should talk about the details about the contract with them

602
00:37:45,559 --> 00:37:46,199
Ok

603
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:48,039
Manager Jiang, manager Wang

604
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:45,320
Are you sleeping?

605
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,280
I just finished my work

606
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:21,400
Me, too

607
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,800
Are you ok?

608
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:03,679
I am fine

609
00:42:03,719 --> 00:42:04,960
No parking here

610
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,280
I'm sorry

611
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:06,960
I will go now

612
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:07,679
Ok...
