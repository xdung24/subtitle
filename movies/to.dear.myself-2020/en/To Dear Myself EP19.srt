00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:32,050
[Ep 19]

3
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:41,799
Sister Siyu

4
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,200
Zhizhi, where are you going?

5
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:46,799
Sister Siyu

6
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:48,760
I am here to ask for a leave, I have some problem

7
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,599
What?

8
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,079
Heart bypass surgery?

9
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:03,239
According to the angiography,

10
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,040
coronary heart disease is very serious

11
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,599
Most of the arteries are blocked

12
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,479
She needs surgery as soon as possible

13
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,680
How much does it cost?

14
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,100
Self-paying part is quite a lot

15
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:15,400
How come?

16
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:25,479
Liu Yang

17
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:28,319
What?

18
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,280
Ok, I'm coming

19
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,120
What happened?

20
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,280
Liu Yang's mom ran away from the hospital

21
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,479
I need to find her now

22
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,560
Wait...

23
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:38,439
I will go with you, I need to get the key now

24
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,520
I was about to give her an infusion

25
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,360
She was saying no surgery and she wanted to go home

26
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:45,560
I persuaded her

27
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,759
But she disappeared in a blink

28
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:48,599
What's the matter with you?

29
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:49,599
Why don't you keep an eye on the patient?

30
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,280
Mom

31
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,280
Mom

32
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,475
She is not in hospital, not at home?

33
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,560
Ok, you go to the train station

34
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,400
I will go to the bus station

35
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,039
Hello, Chengdu, Sichuan

36
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,120
Hello, two tickets

37
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,319
Sister Siyu

38
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,399
Excuse me

39
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:06,560
Thank you

40
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,399
Mom...

41
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:12,680
Excuse me

42
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:14,160
Mom

43
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,399
Where are you going?

44
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,480
I want to go home

45
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:23,879
You are hospitalized

46
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:24,600
You know?

47
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:27,519
I'm fine now

48
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:28,720
No

49
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:30,480
You need the surgery right away

50
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:31,759
Go back with me

51
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,279
Those doctors don't know anything

52
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:36,959
Don't listen to their nonsense

53
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:38,000
Mom

54
00:05:38,725 --> 00:05:40,519
You are worried about money, right?

55
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,959
Don't worry

56
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,079
I have enough money

57
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:47,839
Yang

58
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,560
I heard you when you made those calls

59
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,399
I don't want to get you in a dilemma

60
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:56,959
I don't want to be your nuisance

61
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,560
Mom, I have my solution

62
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,560
What solution?

63
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm really fine

64
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,680
I am fine

65
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,040
I am strong

66
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,399
See, I am fine

67
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:09,160
I can jump, look

68
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,040
No

69
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:10,959
Mom...

70
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:12,160
Mom

71
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:16,000
Mom, be careful

72
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:17,480
Where is your medicine?

73
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:19,720
In the bag

74
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,319
Be careful

75
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,759
Feel better?

76
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,079
I am fine

77
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:51,920
I'm ok

78
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:53,560
Mom

79
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:58,237
If something happened to you, what should I do?

80
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,800
Yang

81
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:12,199
I know, it's hard for you

82
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,279
I don't want to be your nuisance

83
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:32,319
Mom, I am useless

84
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:37,360
Silly boy, you are great

85
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:39,480
It's ok

86
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,560
Come, stand up

87
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,879
Send me off, come

88
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,519
Mom

89
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,040
Mom, don't worry

90
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:07,700
I will cure you even if I go bankrupt

91
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,759
Stop crying, mom

92
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,000
Let's go home

93
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:28,079
Go home

94
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:37,279
Ok

95
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,600
He found her?

96
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,475
Liu Yang is taking his mom back to the hospital

97
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,200
Great

98
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,639
I'll take you back to the hospital

99
00:08:59,175 --> 00:09:02,960
Why does Liu Yang's mom run out of the hospital?

100
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,679
All because of the fee

101
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,639
We don't have the enough money?

102
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:10,600
We borrowed, but it's still not enough

103
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,639
Zhizhi, why don't you tell me?

104
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:21,246
Liu Yang told me not to borrow money from you

105
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:22,559
Why?

106
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:25,360
He says, you are preparing for the bid

107
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,440
Go

108
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:44,840
I go up now

109
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,879
You should go back to the company

110
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,320
Contact me if you need help

111
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:49,039
Ok, bye

112
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:23,639
Is she all right?

113
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,159
She is stable now

114
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:36,440
Zhizhi, come out

115
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,706
Can I mortgage our house?

116
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,440
Not the bank

117
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,960
We need to mortgage it to a company

118
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:58,399
But...

119
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,759
The interest rate is too high

120
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,559
I don't care

121
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,919
We need to get enough money for mom's surgery

122
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:11,960
Ok

123
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,559
Bed No. 34's family

124
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,050
The surgery is arranged on next Wednesday 

125
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,919
But we haven't paid the money

126
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:21,679
You have paid it

127
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,000
Otherwise we won't arrange it for you

128
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:24,159
Who paid the money?

129
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,600
I don't know

130
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,875
See, Li Siyu

131
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:46,250
We owe her such a big debt

132
00:11:59,399 --> 00:11:59,879
Mr. Liu

133
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:00,879
I put the report on your table

134
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,679
Thank you

135
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:06,799
Brother Yang, why are you here?

136
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,360
I am worried

137
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,480
Nothing particular recently

138
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,360
You should take care of aunt in the hospital

139
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,480
I'll call you when we need you

140
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:17,960
How is aunt?

141
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:19,639
It's stable today

142
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,134
But she needs the operation

143
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,039
Well

144
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:40,720
What are you doing?

145
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,840
Brother Yang, sorry

146
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,240
I don't have much money

147
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,399
I have only two thousand, you should take it

148
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,399
You are an intern

149
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:50,879
You have a little salary

150
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,799
How can I take your money?

151
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:55,399
It's little but you should take it

152
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,240
I want to do something for aunt

153
00:12:57,879 --> 00:12:59,080
Thank you

154
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,600
You should take the money back

155
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,639
No, you take it

156
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:02,440
Don't worry

157
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,320
We have got enough money

158
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,120
Really?

159
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,530
Zhizhi's cousin paid some for us

160
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:30,799
Welcome home

161
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,399
A bathtub?

162
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:19,919
The bedroom is quite big

163
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,480
Look, the living room

164
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:57,919
Finally I have a home

165
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:12,919
Let's celebrate it

166
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,399
Ok

167
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,840
I no longer need to be afraid of the rent raise

168
00:15:22,225 --> 00:15:24,159
No longer be afraid of landlord's selling the house

169
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,440
From now on, I became a house slave

170
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,320
Finally become a house slave

171
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,399
This city is so magical

172
00:16:03,725 --> 00:16:08,039
I can make you fly high in an instant

173
00:16:10,675 --> 00:16:15,480
It can make you fall deep in an instant

174
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:18,799
Last moment

175
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:21,799
You thought the future was at your fingertips

176
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,825
Next moment, you may lose everything

177
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:39,600
Why do you think like this?

178
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,679
These three months

179
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,480
It's like riding a roller coaster

180
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:56,225
I became unemployed from an elite marshal overnight

181
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,120
I was rejected over and over again

182
00:17:06,224 --> 00:17:08,639
When I was about to lose my confidence

183
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,599
suddenly everything came back to me

184
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,240
I really feel

185
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,440
Feel it's very unreal

186
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,175
I do not know which is the real me

187
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,403
I even don't know if I can hold everything I have now forever

188
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,400
What?

189
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,519
What are you doing?

190
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:00,519
Come

191
00:18:06,759 --> 00:18:07,559
Don't move

192
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,799
Past, present, future

193
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,839
I'm in your palm

194
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,599
You can hold me forever

195
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:33,516
I think we should have sense of game in decorating the kitchen

196
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,160
When we wash the dishes, we think it's not housework

197
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,200
but it's like playing games

198
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,039
Fair enough

199
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:47,075
Study should be like night market

200
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:51,200
So when we work overtime in the study

201
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,720
we feel it's like visiting the night market

202
00:19:56,839 --> 00:19:57,640
Ok

203
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,119
It's kind of psychological comfort

204
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:02,920
What about the bedroom?

205
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:07,599
I don't know yet

206
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:15,559
You want it a bit evil charm with my persona

207
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:17,675
Or a little rigid with your persona?

208
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:20,480
Rigid?

209
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:22,200
No

210
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,525
So over the past five years, 

211
00:20:24,525 --> 00:20:26,559
rigid is the impression I leave?

212
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,079
Do you have my evil charm?

213
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,039
You win

214
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:41,875
Pay the renovation cost with your credit card

215
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:47,240
Why? You spent all your money?

216
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,720
You may not know

217
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:52,279
Liu Yang's mom had a heart attack

218
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:53,359
She needs a surgery

219
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:55,519
I paid him some surgery fee

220
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,359
So I have no money

221
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,599
I really don't know

222
00:20:58,599 --> 00:20:59,480
He didn't tell me

223
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,480
How much did you pay for the surgery?

224
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:03,400
More than 30,000

225
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:08,240
They can return the money as long as they can afford

226
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,519
Otherwise we won't need the money back

227
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:12,119
You have no objection, right?

228
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:13,599
Of course no objection

229
00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:22,720
What happened?

230
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:27,680
As I remember right, you want to bid for his company's project, right?

231
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,119
How's it going?

232
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:32,279
It's two different matters

233
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,079
I am waiting for the result

234
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:41,720
I think you don't need to wait for the result

235
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:43,039
Just quit

236
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,079
Why?

237
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:49,720
If you put these two things together

238
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,799
you are bribing

239
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:52,759
I definitely didn't mean it

240
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:54,519
I know

241
00:21:54,825 --> 00:21:57,039
But you can't explain it clearly to others

242
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:03,160
I just want to help Zhizhi, and Liu Yang

243
00:22:03,475 --> 00:22:05,440
Yeah, you want to help them

244
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,799
So you need to quit

245
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,279
Why?

246
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,759
Why don't you understand?

247
00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:13,920
Think

248
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:18,425
If it's exposed, what should you do?

249
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,480
You will cause a lot of troubles for Liu Yang

250
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,519
Zhizhi will be implicated, too, right?

251
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:26,720
No one will know this

252
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,375
Walls have ears

253
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,599
Chen Yiming

254
00:22:39,799 --> 00:22:42,450
You want to do this for Tianyi Group?

255
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,519
What do you mean?

256
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:49,200
If I withdraw from this bid

257
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:50,839
28 million is gone

258
00:22:51,575 --> 00:22:54,119
President Pan will lose to president Wang again

259
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,640
You win again in front of president Wang

260
00:22:56,279 --> 00:22:57,279
One more credit

261
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,119
This is your opinion of me?

262
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,880
It's not the first time you do so

263
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:13,920
I admit

264
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:17,150
I did that because of my selfishness

265
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,450
I want to prove myself

266
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:24,425
But now it's different

267
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,200
I really do it for you

268
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,480
For Liu Yang

269
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,319
How about this?

270
00:23:37,025 --> 00:23:38,104
I will resign from Tianyi

271
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:39,599
I quit

272
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,920
You will believe me, right?

273
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,160
Where are you going?

274
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:49,799
Write a resignation letter

275
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,759
You don't need to resign

276
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:00,920
I believe you

277
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:05,960
Siyu

278
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,279
It's not a joke

279
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,279
I promise you

280
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,559
Quit now? Why?

281
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,319
My friend might be suspected of taking bribes

282
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:14,759
You have a clear conscience

283
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:15,720
What are you afraid of?

284
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,960
But it's hard to make it clear

285
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:23,000
President Pan

286
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,920
We have another chance

287
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:25,839
Li Siyu

288
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,079
We don't have another chance

289
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:29,960
It can't be, right?

290
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,440
I am negotiating with Wang Ziru

291
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,160
I think Lubao is at least four billion

292
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,000
She doesn't think so

293
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,880
You know that report

294
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,720
Now she thinks Lubao is only worth three billion

295
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,079
If we lose this government project

296
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,754
Lubao is only worth two billion in her eyes

297
00:25:55,975 --> 00:25:57,640
We still have another two companies, right?

298
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:03,050
Two weeks ago, they dropped out for no reason

299
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,440
Now we have only Tianyi Group

300
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:13,240
If we want to change the current situation

301
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,880
Lubao III must be put into mass production

302
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,325
But that requires at least 800 million capital investment

303
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,079
According to the current company's shareholding structure 

304
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:23,400
we can only give out 20% shares

305
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:26,759
So we can't let Lubao's evaluation drop

306
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:28,359
We can't lose the government project

307
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:30,359
We must win the bid. Must

308
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:32,160
But...

309
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,599
It's not just about Lubao's future

310
00:26:35,025 --> 00:26:37,079
It's about all employees' work

311
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,519
And your dream and mine

312
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:39,920
We must win

313
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,240
Brother Yang

314
00:26:56,519 --> 00:26:57,319
What?

315
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:01,720
Ok, I get it

316
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,640
What happened?

317
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:09,799
President Pan

318
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,839
We won the bid

319
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,400
What did I tell you?

320
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,079
This is the result I want

321
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:19,880
This is the result I want

322
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:22,960
Ai

323
00:27:23,325 --> 00:27:25,880
Tell president Wang of Tianyi Group

324
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,119
I have time now

325
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,559
I can meet her anytime

326
00:27:29,559 --> 00:27:30,319
At any time

327
00:27:32,725 --> 00:27:35,440
Wang Ziru won't have the chance to bargain with me

328
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,720
Li Siyu

329
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,799
I will reward you a lot this time

330
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,440
Reward you

331
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:43,480
President Pan, I'm a little worried

332
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,000
I can tell you

333
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:46,160
This news is worth 300 million

334
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,920
It can let me open another laboratory

335
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:51,279
Have another production line

336
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:53,680
Li Siyu

337
00:27:54,925 --> 00:27:58,160
We will be the best power battery in China

338
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,653
We will be the biggest new energy enterprise in China

339
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,039
You will see

340
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:10,880
We will let Chinese energy move human civilization forward

341
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:14,240
Definitely

342
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,480
Doctor, these indexes are high

343
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:21,640
Is it ok?

344
00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:24,200
Doctor

345
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:25,960
Her these indicators are still high

346
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,880
What is the reason?

347
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,119
Mainly because she is old

348
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:32,359
It's better if you use imported drugs

349
00:28:32,359 --> 00:28:34,400
But you request the domestic medicine

350
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,359
so the effect comes slow

351
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,519
Thank you

352
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:10,510
Liu Yang, what did the doctor say?

353
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,599
You even dare to ask

354
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,240
What?

355
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:17,279
Mom

356
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,160
Aunt, we are here to see you

357
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:24,920
Aunt, we brought you something

358
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:25,880
Give it to me

359
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,240
Thank you...

360
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:27,880
I put it here

361
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:28,960
Ok

362
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:33,519
Feelling better?

363
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:34,960
I have to go now

364
00:29:35,319 --> 00:29:36,000
So anxious?

365
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:37,480
All because of your company

366
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:39,039
We have a meeting today

367
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:40,680
We need to determine the details of the purchase contract

368
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:44,300
Brother Yang, I can't be explicit sometimes

369
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:46,119
But you can rest assured

370
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:48,720
I will remember what you did for me and Lubao in my heart

371
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:49,839
I know what to do

372
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,400
Don't say like that

373
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,680
I did not do anything

374
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,359
I know

375
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,519
Mom, take a good rest

376
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:58,039
I need to have a meeting

377
00:29:58,079 --> 00:29:58,839
Go

378
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,359
I have to go now

379
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,559
Bye bye

380
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:02,279
Bye bye

381
00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:06,880
Aunt

382
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,559
Sit down

383
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:08,200
Girl, sit down

384
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:09,079
Liu Yang

385
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:11,640
Liu Yang

386
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,079
What did you lose your temper just now?

387
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,400
Let me ask you

388
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,000
Why did you change the medicine?

389
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,240
What medicine?

390
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:27,839
How much can you save 

391
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:29,500
when you change the imported into domestic drugs?

392
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,440
You even want to save the little money?

393
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:32,799
It's my mom

394
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,000
I didn't do that

395
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,480
Why they changed the medicine?

396
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:38,000
I didn't tell them to change the medicine

397
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,839
The nurse station asked me to refill the deposit

398
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,279
I told them to give me more days

399
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:43,599
They said, they would discuss about it

400
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:44,559
Discuss?

401
00:30:46,075 --> 00:30:47,640
So they just changed the medicine?

402
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:48,880
I know

403
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,519
You have a conflict with my mom

404
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:52,920
But she is like this now

405
00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:54,880
Can we have some conscience?

406
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:58,480
Why I have no conscience?

407
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,440
How can you say I have no conscience?

408
00:31:00,675 --> 00:31:02,640
Then why did you allow them to do that?

409
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:04,599
All because we have no money

410
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:08,640
I told you to take care of mom in the monring

411
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,240
But you didn't come until noon

412
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,079
What do you mean?

413
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:12,799
I need to work

414
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,039
You can't ask for leave?

415
00:31:14,325 --> 00:31:16,240
I have taken leave three times this week

416
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,599
How can I ask for more?

417
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:19,359
Why you can't?

418
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,079
Your job

419
00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:23,240
A pupil can do it

420
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:32,480
Yes, my job is not important

421
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:36,000
But I earn several thousand yuan a month at least

422
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:40,160
I can't just leave the work aside

423
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:42,240
Zhang Zhizhi

424
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,680
You are my mom's daughter-in-law

425
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:49,240
Mom becomes like this because of you

426
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,119
So no matter what

427
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:53,425
you should take care of her

428
00:31:57,825 --> 00:32:01,240
I need to work and take care of daughter at the same time

429
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:04,079
Now I need to send meals for her

430
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:05,440
What should I do now?

431
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,039
What do you mean?

432
00:32:11,559 --> 00:32:12,640
Yes

433
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:15,680
Mom becomes like this because of me

434
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,279
But mom has heart disease for a decade

435
00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:19,960
It has nothing to do with me, right?

436
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:27,519
Unreasonable, ridiculous

437
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:03,300
Xiaoling's gallery has exhibition recently

438
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:05,400
She said she would come here to see you soon

439
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:07,319
Ok, thank you

440
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:11,079
What happened?

441
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:12,519
Nothing

442
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,759
Mom, how's the height?

443
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:18,599
Adjust it higher?

444
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,640
No need, leave it be

445
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:25,799
No need

446
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,119
It's ok

447
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:32,960
Yiming

448
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:36,799
Yiming, wait for me

449
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,720
Yiming

450
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,559
Chen Yiming

451
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:49,359
Yiming

452
00:33:52,519 --> 00:33:53,880
Because of the tender?

453
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,000
So what else could it be?

454
00:33:57,599 --> 00:33:59,005
You have promised me

455
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,279
It's not as simple as you think

456
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:02,759
You made it complicated

457
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:04,400
No

458
00:34:05,075 --> 00:34:06,920
It's not just about me. It's about president Pan

459
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,719
It's about hundreds of employees

460
00:34:09,025 --> 00:34:10,920
I don't have the final say

461
00:34:11,559 --> 00:34:12,280
What about Liu Yang?

462
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:13,840
Have you thought about Liu Yang?

463
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,679
I thought about it

464
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:16,199
Liu Yang and I did nothing wrong

465
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:18,039
I give him money because Zhizhi is my cousin

466
00:34:18,039 --> 00:34:19,079
I have a clear conscience

467
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,119
It's your wishful thinking

468
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:24,275
But people will think it's exchange of interests 

469
00:34:24,824 --> 00:34:27,158
Actually it's not true

470
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:28,518
Why are you so stubborn?

471
00:34:28,518 --> 00:34:29,238
Li Siyu

472
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:30,639
No one will believe your wishful thinking

473
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:31,679
No

474
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:32,719
Only you would think so

475
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,825
Can you stop deceiving yourself?

476
00:34:37,425 --> 00:34:38,239
Let me ask you

477
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:39,400
If something happens, what will you do?

478
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:40,920
What will others think of you?

479
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,074
They will think you resort to every possible way 

480
00:34:43,074 --> 00:34:45,164
for your sales performance

481
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,639
Resort to every possible way?

482
00:34:49,518 --> 00:34:51,439
I could have got more

483
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,599
But I didn't do anything

484
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,280
Because I believe in Lubao products' quality

485
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,400
I believe in the fairness of the tender

486
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:58,350
I couldn't ruin Lubao or my colleagues 

487
00:34:58,350 --> 00:35:01,559
to prove my innocence when I did nothing

488
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:02,960
Lubao will not be ruined

489
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:06,650
As long as your president Pan is not so eager for quick success

490
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:09,559
Chen Yiming

491
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:11,320
Resort to every possible way

492
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,480
eager for quick success

493
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,559
How about you?

494
00:35:13,559 --> 00:35:16,794
You think you force us to withdraw not because of yourself at all?

495
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,559
It's true

496
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,880
No

497
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:21,800
You forgot?

498
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,239
You just apologized for your selfishness

499
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,480
Ridiculous

500
00:35:33,475 --> 00:35:36,639
We are negotiating the details

501
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:40,500
If things go smoothly, next week

502
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,956
we will sign the contract with the government

503
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,559
Congratulations

504
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:53,119
After we win the government project,

505
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:56,435
many friends regain the interest in Lubao

506
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,239
So realistic

507
00:35:57,239 --> 00:36:01,440
Well, I can't stand the temptation

508
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:03,840
You need to try harder

509
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,679
So I am here

510
00:36:09,079 --> 00:36:11,920
Ok, let's get back to business

511
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,800
800 million, 20%

512
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:17,519
500 million, 20%

513
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,559
President Wang

514
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:23,025
If you can't give 800 million, I think we are done talking

515
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,840
800 million, ok

516
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:28,679
But I need to hold 30% shares

517
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,840
Impossible

518
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:31,920
So what's your offer?

519
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:34,300
I will give you at most 21%

520
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:37,480
President Pan

521
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:41,383
Lubao III still has many problems

522
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,800
22%

523
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,639
President Pan

524
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:54,325
Generally, Lubao's evaluation is less than 4 billion

525
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:58,400
And Lubao is not the unique one

526
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,840
Lubao is unique

527
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:04,480
22%

528
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:08,588
If you bargain again, we are done talking

529
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:12,500
Only sincere buyers will negotiate with the price

530
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:19,280
29%

531
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:24,800
President Wang, let me tell you the truth

532
00:37:26,375 --> 00:37:28,679
Some new funds contacted me

533
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,159
I offer 18%

534
00:37:31,159 --> 00:37:31,719
800 million

535
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:32,880
They are interested

536
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,719
But renegotiation will waste much time

537
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:38,679
So I want to cooperate with you again

538
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:45,825
I won't mind finding a new partner if you are not sincere enough

539
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:47,599
President Pan

540
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:50,039
I can tell you the truth

541
00:37:50,039 --> 00:37:52,159
Fund negotiations are all the same routine

542
00:37:52,725 --> 00:37:54,360
They are very sincere in the beginning

543
00:37:54,519 --> 00:37:59,075
When you choose the only partner, he will ask a high price

544
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,880
So just forget it

545
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:04,775
Anyway, financing is not fatal to Lubao

546
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:09,159
No big deal

547
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,760
28%

548
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,039
22%

549
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:17,679
22%

550
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,159
This share

551
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:23,079
Valid within 24 hours

552
00:38:24,679 --> 00:38:26,519
Otherwise we are really done talking

553
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,199
Mr. Liang, I have an appointment with a client at three

554
00:38:50,199 --> 00:38:50,760
It will end at four

555
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,920
Then I will go directly to see you

556
00:38:52,519 --> 00:38:53,599
Ok, see you later

557
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,559
Kuaizi

558
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,559
It's downloaded

559
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,639
It needs three minutes 

560
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,760
Still angry?

561
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,599
You didn't contact me for a week

562
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,360
You are so audacious now

563
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,360
I can get off work before ten today

564
00:39:56,119 --> 00:39:56,800
Let's talk

565
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:05,880
Will you work overtime today?

566
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:18,920
Should we have a talk?

567
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:35,280
President Wang

568
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:36,199
Yiming

569
00:40:52,679 --> 00:40:54,280
In a bad mood?

570
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,119
No

571
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,559
Have you met Lu Bao's Pan Zhiyong?

572
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,480
Yes

573
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:10,599
So what kind of person is Pan Zhiyong?

574
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:17,200
He is quite capable and courageous

575
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,840
But he is a little smug

576
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:32,116
So do you think he will make a bluff or take some risk?

577
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,440
It's hard to tell. He...

578
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:41,100
It's hard to see him through

579
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,679
Later I will have a little talk with some guys

580
00:41:51,079 --> 00:41:52,880
About the failure of Lubao's negotiation

581
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:53,840
Will you come?

582
00:41:54,639 --> 00:41:55,440
Me?

583
00:41:56,679 --> 00:41:58,239
Not a formal meeting

584
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:01,559
Better not

585
00:42:02,599 --> 00:42:03,239
Ok

586
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:13,474
Pan Zhiyong told me, some fund companies contacted him

587
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:15,920
It's not good for us

588
00:42:17,375 --> 00:42:19,920
As I know, Lubao's bank loan is due soon

589
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,900
I think it's helpful for our next round of negotiation

590
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,760
But he may not be short of money

591
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:29,039
Would it be possible that Pan Zhiyong makes a bluff?

592
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,065
Pan Zhiyong is a typical leader

593
00:42:35,639 --> 00:42:37,440
He may be a little smug

594
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,400
But he won't make a bluff

595
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:47,852
I think it's a breakthrough that Pan Zhiyong changed 20% into 22%

596
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:51,650
But our goal is 23% at least

597
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,104
We can give an offer of 25%

598
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:57,760
Will it irriate Pan Zhiyong?

599
00:42:58,039 --> 00:42:59,119
Then we will have no chance

600
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,679
Leaders will not be irritated

601
00:43:02,519 --> 00:43:03,800
He was afraid of being despised

602
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:06,868
Then we should insist, 23%

603
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,222
But in terms of evaluation, should we make some compromise?

604
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:15,039
But I think 22% is the bottom line

605
00:43:15,039 --> 00:43:17,500
Otherwise he won't give the deadline of 24 hours

606
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:23,775
President Wang, we must reply within 24 hours?

607
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,079
Correct

608
00:43:25,719 --> 00:43:27,440
We only have 14 hours to go

609
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,440
You should go back now

610
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:35,599
I need to think about it
