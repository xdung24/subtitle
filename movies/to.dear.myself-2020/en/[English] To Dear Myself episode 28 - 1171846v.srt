00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,220
Director Li.

5
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,170
Here you are.

6
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:55,330
There are some problems here.

7
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,910
Here. Here. And here.

8
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:03,450
Adjust a bit. Quickly finish it.

9
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,270
When can you finish the interaction design?

10
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:17,050
There are some logical bugs in the process design. The front end cannot solve them.

11
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:20,250
Can't solve them? It's been three days.

12
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:28,320
If there is still no result today, nobody is allowed to leave the office.

13
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,530
I work overtime until late night every day!

14
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,860
My parents both think I joined a pyramid scheme organization.

15
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,140
If it keeps like this, how can I find a boyfriend?

16
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,300
The plan you made...

17
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,700
Xiao Jiang, is someone here for an interview?

18
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,650
He arrived. I saw him come inside.

19
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:45,080
Where is he?

20
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:53,790
You should be in the general manager's office. What are you doing here?

21
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,330
Wait. Let me finish this round.

22
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:57,780
Are you here to play games or get a job?

23
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,600
Work is playing a game. Playing a game is work.

24
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:04,280
Finish!

25
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,670
Your office's wifi is good. I think I can stay.

26
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:11,530
You can leave now.

27
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,250
What do you mean?

28
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,740
My company doesn't need people like you.

29
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,750
Why don't you need someone like me?

30
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,090
You can leave.

31
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:38,930
You didn't even check my resume and asked me to leave.

32
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:43,170
Come on. As a general manager, can you pay me the basic respect?

33
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:45,710
Respect?

34
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,780
Respect is given to people who deserve it.

35
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:53,790
Right. I'm one of them! Look. You will know it after you see my resume.

36
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:03,440
You were born in 1998? No wonder...

37
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,240
This is the second time you looked down upon me.

38
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,260
How did I look down on you?

39
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:13,090
I asked for people with more than 3 years' experience.

40
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:15,220
Please continue reading.

41
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:20,750
I wanted a UI designer.

43

Designed webpages since freshman year.

44
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,390
Just for fun.

45
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:39,800
Ant. Workout. Mint. Did you participate in all these?

46
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,130
That was when I was young.

47
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:49,870
You finished all those independently?

48
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:52,360
Do I need people to help me?

49
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,350
I can offer you an internship position.

50
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:03,530
Elder sister. Bye.

51
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:33,340
- What are you doing? 
 - Don't be nervous.

52
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:36,160
I have an idea.

53
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,040
Come over here.

54
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,040
Who are you?

55
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,240
- Really. I will forget it immediately! 
 - What?

56
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,280
It's related to our designing. Come on.

57
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,430
What are you doing?

58
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:47,750
Give it to me first.

59
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,280
Marker. Give me the marker.

60
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,280
Young hero. Respect! Amazing!

61
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,610
Remember, the communicative property

62
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:18,600
should be superior to aesthetics.

63
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,550
- Guan Xiaotang. 
 - Yes!

64
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,330
Are you offering me a position like a UI engineer?

65
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:32,430
Go back and prepare to come to work tomorrow. Coming to work late and leaving early are not allowed.

66
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:35,070
Don't play mobile games during work hours.

67
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,310
I can't agree to that.

68
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:39,100
You can't? Then leave.

69
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:52,330
Do you know why I came to do this interview?

70
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,580
Why?

71
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,530
On the market, among these types of companies and positions,

72
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,720
you offered the lowest salary.

73
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:02,000
What do you mean?

74
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,270
Low salary means work expectations are low as well.

75
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:08,720
I just want to find a job where I won't have to work too much and have too much pressure, and I want to find a boss who doesn't care what I do.

76
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,090
Do you think that there are any jobs on the market that meet your needs?

77
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:18,800
But if you want to find an employee of my skill by offering such a low salary, that's also impossible.

78
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:22,720
How about this? As long as I finish my work,

79
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,110
I can be late, leave work early, and play games during office hours.

80
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:36,470
As long as you finish your work, you can come late and leave early,

81
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:40,510
but you can't play games during work!

82
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:42,910
Deal!

83
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:45,290
Come to work at 9:00 a.m. tomorrow.

84
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:48,940
You just said that I was allowed to be late. I plan to come at 9:30.

91

- I will help you. 
 - Okay!

92
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:40,560
The teacher gave us this.

93
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:45,570
She told us to give it to our parents when we go back home.

94
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:53,620
Mom, did we run out of money again?

95
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:57,620
Who said this? We have money.

96
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,610
Put it back, Baby.

97
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:02,010
Let's go!

98
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:05,250
Go.

Great.

LPL No. 2 seeded team. I won! I won! I won! Yes!

104
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,160
Does that have anything to do with you at all?

105
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,300
Yes! They won't give you any bonus.

106
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,130
This is a great day! It's upsetting to work overtime.

107
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:40,640
I will treat everyone. Barbecue plus karaoke. Who's in?

108
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,600
- Me! I'm in! 
 - Me too!

109
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,220
Sit. Sit. We can't go.

110
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,460
Don't. Don't! Let's go together!

111
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,480
I'm definitely not going.

112

00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,100
- Exactly. 
 - Yeah.

115

Go back immediately!

116

Director Li went out on a date.

117
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,780
Why should we work overtime here?

118
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:04,190
Impossible! I heard her boyfriend dumped her,

119
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:08,360
- so she works like crazy to subdue her heartbreak. 
 - Right.

120
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:13,720
At the same time, she vents her hatred towards men like you guys.

121
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,920
Cut the nonsense. Let's go!

122
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,750
- Is this okay? 
 - Go! Go now!

123
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,120
Let's go together!

What are all of you doing here?

128

We are done for the day.

129
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:38,090
- Who let you go? 
 - The labor law.

Older Sister, we need rest.

134
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:54,700
Please call me Director Li in the office.

135
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,220
Or Miss Li.

136

Older Sister... Director Li.

137
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:08,730
Did you finish your work?

138
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:11,960
According to Beijing time, I finished my work at 17:10.

139
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,850
You can leave now.

140
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,270
How about them?

141
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:21,090
They have their own work.

142
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:24,790
They have worked for 10 hours. They should be done for the day.

143
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:30,370
Guan Xiaotang, you can make no attempt to make progress. But don't influence others.

144
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:33,560
They are not others. They don't want to work overtime.

145
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:38,420
You won't understand when someone works for their dream, there is no concept like starting and finishing work.

146
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:43,460
I don't think they are working for their dream. They are working for your dream.

147
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:46,690
You are too young to understand this.

148
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:51,330
But what I can understand is Older Sister Li Siyu, the general manager,

149
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:55,080
you can't ask all the people to work overtime because of your own misfortune.

150
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,370
What are you talking about?

151
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:58,420
We are not your ex-boyfriend.

152
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,750
Don't vent your hatred about him to us, okay?

153
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,270
Guan Xiaotang!

154
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:05,280
Oh gosh.

[General Manager Room]

157
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:25,120
Let's finish here today. Go back and rest.

158
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:29,520
Director Li, this plan...

159
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,240
Do it tomorrow.

160
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:35,510
Then?

161
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,420
What then?

162
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,650
You aren't going to announce that you're firing me?

163
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:55,160
According to this pattern,

164
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,410

00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:13,690
Thank you for fighting for us to get one evening's rest.

167
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:39,210
Tell me. Which department do you want to transfer to?

168
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:43,610
As long as it has a higher salary, any department is okay.

169
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:48,160
I need to remind you. The department with higher salary will have higher pressure.

170
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:54,120
It won't be worse than the pressure of life.

171
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:58,490
All right. I will ask for you.

172
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:12,170
I think if I continue to work at Caijin,

173
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:14,070
I definitely won't have a future.

174
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,180
You had an epiphany?

175
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:21,230

What are you thinking about?

179
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:39,480
Thinking over what you just said.

180
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:43,810
No need. I have thoroughly self-reflected.

181
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:48,550
During the half of the year since I met her, we eat and drink,

182
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:53,160
chatting and have fun. But why haven't we made any progress with our relationship?

183
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:58,000
She went to have blind dates and look for a boyfriend in front of me. Why?

184
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:01,600
Because she doesn't like you.

185
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,230
No. Because my means of pursuing her are wrong!

186
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:07,300
It's a strategic objective.

187
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:11,780
I used tactic missiles. It for sure won't work.

188
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,650
I should change to a strategic missile!

189
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:21,710
What are you talking about? Can you say something that I can understand?

190
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:27,200
Gu Xiaoling is like a panini with meat and egg.

191
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,120
But what I can give her is a deep-fried dough stick.

192
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:35,090
So, in other words, I can't give her my heart and hope she gives me hers.

193
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:37,400
I have to get rich overnight.

194
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:47,120
I have a primary school classmate. He doesn't even know how to calculate.

195
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,630
Since he started to work in social media,

196
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:52,730
he upgrades his car every two months.

197
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:57,400
You want to quit your job to work on social media?

198
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,430
Aren't you familiar with this? I want to listen to your suggestion.

199
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,840
Haowen, how about this?

200
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,840
Don't quit now.

201
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,920
Give me some time. I will talk about this with you later.

202
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:13,090
Good bro!

203
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,550
How is Siyu?

204
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,500
Siyu?

205
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,940
She is busy with her startup.

206
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,840
You are still thinking of her?

207
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,220
How about I ask Xiaoling to ask for you?

208
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,270
I just asked casually.

209
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:44,360
You have such a good location but just earn ¥7000-8000 for one month? This is a big loss!

210
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,330
If you join "Laidianle," I can promise

211
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:49,850
that you will earn a profit of ¥150,000 in the first year. ¥300,0000 in the second year.

212
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:17,190
I will provide the brand, training, technique, and promotion.

213
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:21,080
We split the rent and the profit 50-50. I will subsidize you the installation cost.

214
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:24,630
I will subsidize you ¥200 for every new member.

215
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:27,730
I will be there to sign the contract with you.

216
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:38,190
Come on! Why do you draw back all the time?

217
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:40,730
They still have health. That's right. Right. Right.

218
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:44,100
Shoot him first! Look at me! At me!

219
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,290
Look at me! I'm coming!

220
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:51,690
Go! Go! Go!

221
00:19:57,170 --> 00:20:00,220
Why don't you look at my position?

222
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,870
Guan Xiaotang! Guan Xiaotang!

223
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:05,900
I'm playing a game. Your phone!

224
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,000
From Director Li!

225
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:13,710
Don't report me. I didn't mean to make you lose.

226
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:24,940
Hello?

227
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,740
Why didn't you answer my phone?

228
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:27,940
I was pooping in the toilet.

229
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:32,800
Listen, I just talked with some franchisers. I've sent you all the materials to your email.

230
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:36,050
By tomorrow morning at 6:00, you add them to our website with

231
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:39,000
their logos in our test environment. The clients want to have a look.

232
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:43,750
Pay attention. Don't delay and make mistakes.

233
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,310
I get it.

234
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:53,040
I asked around. The general manager's office doesn't want people.

235
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,870
You can't do the jobs of the Research and Development Department and the Testing Department.

236
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:59,970
The Planning Department, GM Pan already thinks there are too many people and he wants to downsize it.

237
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:02,000
So it's impossible for them to recruit more people now.

238
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,450
As for the warehouse, their salary is even lower than the Admin Department. You don't want to go there for sure.

239
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:10,890
How about other departments? The Financial Department for example?

240
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:14,420
The Financial Department requires that you have a CPA.

241
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:16,960
How about the Development Department?

242
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,400
Your experience and qualification are not enough.

243
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:26,500
I think it's very realistic for you to stay in the Admin Department.

244
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,700
This is the bill from my daughter's kindergarten. I need to pay ¥9,000 for one season.

245
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:52,050
This week is the deadline of the payment.

246
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:59,320
This is my husband's receipts for hospitalization.

247
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:03,920
Apart from the insurance, we need to pay over ¥10,000 by ourselves.

248
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:08,600
We have spent all the money that we saved.

249
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:14,410
I really can't survive with the current salary.

250
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,900
Okay. I will ask for you one more time.

251
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,250
Thank you, Director Hu.

252
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:30,140
- Director Li. 
 - Thank you.

253
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,790
Director Li.

254
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,440
Xiao Yang!

255
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,000
Xiao Yang!

256
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,430
Have we passed the pressure test?

257
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:42,240
Director Li, we've just passed the first pressure test. The second one starts from tomorrow.

258
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,190
Okay.

259
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:46,490
Lao Liu, the promotion plan?

260
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,350
I've sent you the digital version to your email.

261
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:49,980
Okay.

262
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,240
- Tingting. 
 - Yes, Director Li.

263
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,430
Did you modify the content layout?

264
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:56,630
- I've changed it. You can have a look by opening the testing website. 
 - Okay.

265
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,390
- Zhou Tianyu. 
 - Yes.

266
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:02,950
We just got several franchisees. Did Guan Xiaotang put them in yet?

267
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:04,830
I didn't see it.

268
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,390
Where is Guan Xiaotang?

269
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:10,120
Guan Xiaotang?

270
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,820
Where is the thing I asked from you?

271
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:44,140
I... I wanted to stay up to do that. I didn't even go back home.

272
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:46,120
Then?

273
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:50,860
Then I decided to play two rounds to freshen up my mind.

274
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,350
Then?

275
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:56,460
Then I played and I felt sleepy so I thought after I napped

276
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,470
I would get it done.

277
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:00,750
Then?

278
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,560
Then I was woken up by you.

279
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:08,590
Don't worry. I will give it to you by 12:00.

280
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:21,730
How can you hit people?

281
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:23,570
I've done all I promised. And you?

282
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:25,800
I... I just messed up.

283
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,550
Why wouldn't you do your work? Why would you play video games during work?

284
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,250
I messed up. Hey! Hey!

285
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:32,060
You can't keep your promise.

286
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,710
No!

287
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:39,070
Get out! Immediately!

288
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,420
Director Fang,

289
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:38,150
I will hand in a proposal to the board.

290
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:40,310
What about?

291
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:44,680
I want to adjust the company's business model and industrial structure from the capital's perspective.

292
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:48,360
You want to discuss about how to rebrand Lubao?

293
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,850
Yes. To ensure this proposal can be passed,

294
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:56,830
I would like to ask you to talk with some board members in advance.

295
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,360
President Wang,

296
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:17,010
actually, a few days ago, GM Pan had a chat with me.

297
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:19,010
What did you talk about?

298
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:24,630
He asked me to re-consider Lubao3's production line.

299
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:27,650
He hasn't given up?

300
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:34,830
President Wang, I was thinking if Lubao3 completely launches into the market,

301
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:38,830
it will also be good for Lubao's valuation. Right?

302
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:45,730
After we install these 2 lines, we would spend almost all of the ¥8,000,000,000.

303
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:48,480
You can make a profit of tens of millions of yuan, right?

304
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,200
After 3-5 years, can Lubao's valuation reach ¥5,000,000,000?

305
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,840
Is it fun?

306
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:58,800
But when we started Lubao,

307
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:03,360
we wanted to build China's best new energy enterprise.

308
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:10,340
If Lubao's valuation reaches ¥20,000,000,000, can you say it's not China's best energy company?

309
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:14,190
Pan Zhiyong says that he needs 5 to 10 years to realize this dream.

310
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:17,060
In my way, just one year.

311
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:21,510
But the company's valuation can't be broken away from production value and profit, right?

312
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,580
Then, how can you explain Tesla?

313
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:31,470
They still have a deficit but their valuation has reached over US$30,000,000,000 and it's still increasing.

314
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:36,710
One company's valuation isn't so closely related to production value and profit.

315
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:42,860
It is the operational efficiency of assets and the company's room for growth that can decide the company's valuation.

316
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:47,670
We should make use of all the capital to forge this concept

317
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:50,260
instead of the production line.

318
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:55,730
This is very different from the market which I am used to.

319
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:57,530
It is.

320
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:59,150
The time has changed.

321
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:01,730
Pan Zhiyong's way is outdated.

322
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:04,240
Lubao needs to change tracks.

323

 Timing & Subtitles by My Dear Myself Team @Viki.com 

324
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:40,110
Guan Xiaotang,

325
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:43,330
weren't you fired already? Why do you still come back?

326
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:49,370
I left a cup here.

327
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:52,930
Isn't it just a cup?

328
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:54,900
It's still worthy of some money.

329
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,490
The ghost of poverty.

330
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:58,450
Are you still working overtime?

331
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,810
Isn't it the awful mess that you left me with?

332
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:05,210
Only you?

333
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:07,110
Director Li is also here.

334
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,820
I will go to look for my cup.

335
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:08,380
Director Liu, I have some trouble for the moment.

336
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:10,490
Can I give it to you tomorrow?

337
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:14,020
It's all my fault. I didn't finish what I promised you.

338
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,680
I apologize to you.

339
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,660
I'm really sorry.

340
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:22,140
I apologize to you.

341
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:26,090
I promise that I will definitely give it to you by 8:00 tomorrow morning.

342
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:29,650
Okay. Thank you.

343
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,770
Go back home to sleep. I will do it.

344
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:37,210
Didn't you already—?

345
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:40,730
Turn off your phone and take a good rest.

346
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,780
- Go. 
 - Getting my bag.

347
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,910
Why are you here?

348
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:48,070
Didn't I ask you to get out?

349
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:51,150
Giving a present to you before I leave.

350
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,400
Where is Zhou Tianyu?

351
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,600
I asked him to go back.

352
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:03,010
- Guan Xiaotang, you want to ruin me on purpose? 
 - Older Sister,

353
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:05,700
are your hormones out of whack?

354
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,900
What?

355
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:09,020
You are hot-tempered.

356
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:13,020
You told the client tomorrow 8:00 a.m. Okay.

357
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:16,140
I promise to show you the result by 6:00 a.m.

358
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:22,410
- Are you calling Zhou Tianyu? 
- The number you have dialed, the phone has been turned off.

359
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:25,600
I asked him to turn off his phone.

360
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:29,800
Don't worry, Older Sister. I can do my work fast and well.

361
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,100
I don't trust you.

362
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:37,540
But you don't have anyone now. So you have to trust me.

363
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:43,040
Stop talking nonsense. Go to work!

364
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:10,840
You are like my mom watching me to do my homework when I was young.

365
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,350
If I was your mom,

366
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:16,460
I would have already beaten you up and left you with your skin cut open and flesh torn.

367
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,940
Guan Xiaotang!

368
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:44,520
Guan Xiaotang!

369
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:46,990
Guan Xiaotang!

370
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:49,190
Guan Xiaotang!

371
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:51,140
Here.

372
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:53,250
Where have you been?

373
00:34:53,970 --> 00:34:56,170
Buying breakfast for you.

374
00:34:57,230 --> 00:35:00,740
Do you still have the mood for breakfast?

375
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:05,710
Older Sister, can you change your morning temperament?

376
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:07,070
What time is it already?

377
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:09,200
I've finished it!

378
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:13,730
- What? 
 - I've sent it to your email one hour ago. Don't need to thank me.

379
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,580
You just need to give me overtime pay.

380
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,390
You are reliable for one time finally.

381
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:21,880
Do I still need to get out?

382
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,220
Get out!

383
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,630
I still have to?

384
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:26,920
Go home and sleep.

385
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,800
Thank you, my young lord.

386
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:40,800
Dad!

387
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,140
Have you packed up?

388
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,840
Yes.

389
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,860
Let's go.

390
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:54,370
- Where to go? 
 - Leave the hospital.

391
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:56,910
Go back home!

392
00:35:56,910 --> 00:36:01,040
- Are you happy to see Dad come back home? 
 - Happy!

393
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,750
Let's go.

394
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:08,340
Sit tight.

395
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:33,710
Where do we go now?

396
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:40,450
I already helped you move out of your place.

397
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:45,170
It's good.

398
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,070
Thank you.

399
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:58,030
You can get in the car.

400
00:36:58,030 --> 00:37:00,190
Get in, Baby.

401
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,740
[Hand in hand]
[Shared Ride]

402
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:43,180
Mom, I want to watch TV.

403
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,360
Just one episode.

404
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:18,420
Liu Yang,

405
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,780
you sleep in this room. Yuwei and I will sleep in that room.

406
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:25,830
Here.

407
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:31,200
Zhizhi, I already come back home. Should we still be like this?

408
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:35,290
I only asked for half-day leave. I have to go back to work.

409
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:40,410
You stay with Yuwei. I will cook dinner when I come back.

410
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:10,990
Sit on me.

411
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:23,670
Three years ago was the golden age to start a new social media business.

412
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:26,800
But from last year, this great mass fervor is dropping.

413
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,910
Until today, social media has already become a red sea.

414
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:34,770
In other words, I am late.

415
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:39,350
To be exact, the legendary way of making money by only operating a public account,

416
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:42,160
won't show up very easily.

417
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:48,040
My way to get rich suddenly has been blocked?

418
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,700
That doesn't mean you don't have any opportunity.

419
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:54,220
I'm cooperating with a social media company now.

420
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:57,860
The yearly income is still over ¥1,000,000.

421
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:00,520
But they are operated by a team.

422
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:03,410
Their contents are well designed and personalized.

423
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:06,590
Also, they have a good strategy to monetize internet traffic.

424
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:14,080
All these conditions, I have none.

425
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,280
Then don't give up so quickly.

426
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,470
Of course, I have to.

427
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:22,340
Gu Xiaoling has started marriage-seeking online.

428
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:27,630
Actually for the moment within the social media industry,

429
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:31,870
there is no one working on the branding of financing institutions.

430
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:34,090
When your followers increase,

431
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:36,810
you can turn the traffic into advertisement.

432
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:40,890
And you can also turn them into clients of financial institutions.

433
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:46,440
There is a way.

434
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,970
If you can really setup a team,

435
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:52,100
I can help you with the contents.

436
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:54,130
You're so generous.

437
00:40:57,870 --> 00:41:00,280
I know

438
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:03,780
that I still have fate to get rich overnight.

439
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:12,450
What about the thing I asked you to do?

440
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:14,400
What?

441
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,920
Didn't you say that you would ask Gu Xiaoling?

442
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:21,450
Siyu must live better than you now.

443
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:24,480
Look at you. So decadent.

444
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:30,500
How is her company going?

445
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,600
I don't know about that.

446
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:41,970
Guan Xiaotang, you want me to punch you again?

447
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:46,140
I want to see the complete one by 11:00 tomorrow.

448
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:51,840
I don't even go to bed. You want to sleep?

449
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,490
That's it!

450
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:08,900
Gu Xiaoling, can you mute your phone? It's very noisy.

451
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:12,230
Coming! Coming!

452
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,130
Let me see.

453
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:19,960
What are you up to? So busy.

454
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:22,510
A website recommends me a lot of candidates.

455
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:25,160
A lot? How many?

456
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,370
Several dozens.

457
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:28,220
Dozens? Can you manage to meet them all?

458
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:31,600
After the first selection, there are less than 20 left.

459
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,540
I will meet them in a few days.

460
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:34,990
First selection?

461
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:38,130
You make it sound like a job fair.

462
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:40,780
That's much more important.

463
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:43,890
If you hire the wrong person, you can fire him.

464
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:46,760
But if you find the wrong husband, that's a lifetime problem.

465
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:51,230
Then you will still have a first test, second test, and final competition?

466
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:52,940
You are right.

467
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:55,360
Let  me show you.

468
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,890
Look at this one for me.

469
00:42:56,890 --> 00:42:58,790
How is he?

470
00:42:58,790 --> 00:43:00,560
- Have a look! 
 - I'm busy!

471
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,660
Quick! Help me look! Look!

472
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:03,680
How is he?

473
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,310
What?

474
00:43:05,310 --> 00:43:07,340
Take a look.

475
00:43:08,290 --> 00:43:10,980
Phoenix group. Dark horse group.

476
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:14,230
Born with a silver spoon in mouth group, resurgence group.

477
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:15,800
Bingo.

478
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,820
Why are you grouping them?

479
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,340
I rated them.

480
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:28,250
According to their height, weight, look, and family background.

481
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:30,500
The most important is their financial condition.

482
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:32,900
The data could be wrong as well.

483
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:36,610
So I will select the first two of each group.

484
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:39,020
Then I will meet with them in person.

485
00:43:39,790 --> 00:43:43,230
May I ask you, Miss Gu, how would you rate yourself?

486
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:48,030
Based on my perfect look, 100 points.

487
00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:50,230
You are not original.

488
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:52,660
Mine has just a little adjustment.

489
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:56,820
By the way, my skin has completely recovered lately. You see I look younger, right?

490
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:58,800
Can I add 20 more points?

491
00:44:01,770 --> 00:44:04,130
Look.

492
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:12,970
Here is a photo from 10 years ago?

493
00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:16,780
Help me to look. Am I younger than before?

494
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:20,240
Photo.

495
00:44:23,310 --> 00:44:27,920
I didn't know I had a photo of Chen Yiming and you.

496
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:40,190
When did you secretly take this? I didn't know.

497
00:44:40,190 --> 00:44:42,690
When you two were just together.

498
00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:45,890
My mom got to know this. So she wanted to know how he looked like quickly.

499
00:44:45,890 --> 00:44:48,150
Then I took a photo secretly.

500
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:50,600
Delete it.

501
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:54,720
You said it. This is out of print.

502
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,120
What "out of print"?

503
00:44:56,120 --> 00:45:01,030
Don't think that I don't know that you blocked all the contact information of Chen Yiming.

504
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:03,990
You deleted all the photos with him as well.

505
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:10,120
If I delete it, then you have nothing left.

506
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,920
Delete it.

507
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,740
Okay.

508
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:16,350
Delete it.

509
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:21,390
Don't. Send it to me.

510
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:24,960
I knew it.

511
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:31,820
This beauty needs some sleep.

♫ En... ♫

525
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:53,810
♫  Dear Myself  ♫

526
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:56,910
♫  Listen to the voice inside  ♫

527
00:46:56,910 --> 00:47:00,960
♫  In this lonely world, be cautious  ♫

528
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,280
♫  After we're hurt, we learn to cherish  ♫

529
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:06,650
♫  Dear Myself  ♫

530
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:09,940
♫  Use all your strength  ♫

531
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:14,150
♫  Missing the simple you from the past  ♫

532
00:47:14,150 --> 00:47:16,460
♫  Turn difficulties into courage  ♫

533
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:20,410
♫  Don't back down from the crowd  ♫

534
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:23,320
♫  Growth is inevitably accompanied by setbacks  ♫

535
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:26,480
♫  The best way to overcome difficulties is to smile  ♫

536
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,490
♫  Are you afraid of all the punishment given by fate?  ♫

537
00:47:28,490 --> 00:47:30,640
♫  Let everything go, all those concerns, real or fake  ♫

538
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,840
♫  Cannot erase the scar, but it's just a scar  ♫

539
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:35,350
♫  We are so small yet so determined  ♫

540
00:47:35,350 --> 00:47:36,990
♫  Occasionally fussy and occasionally firm  ♫

541
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:40,540
♫  If growth leaves a trace, then the trace is left be tears  ♫

542
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:43,290
♫  Your back that I've always been chasing  ♫

543
00:47:43,290 --> 00:47:45,580
♫  Finally turned around to hug me tightly  ♫

544
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:49,180
♫  It's still that familiar you  ♫

545
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:52,410
♫ Ye... ♫

546
00:47:52,410 --> 00:47:56,360
♫ Oh... ♫

547
00:47:58,670 --> 00:48:01,960
♫  Dear Myself  ♫

548
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:05,240
♫  Listen to the voice inside  ♫

549
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:09,360
♫  I'll give you the warmth that the wind took  ♫

550
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:11,720
♫  Hugging you, hugging me  ♫

551
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:15,020
♫  Dear Myself  ♫

552
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:19,010
♫  The sky has finally cleared  ♫

553
00:48:19,010 --> 00:48:22,270
♫  We've never been so clear-headed  ♫

554
00:48:22,270 --> 00:48:24,410
♫  Looking for the past me who  ♫

555
00:48:24,410 --> 00:48:27,950
♫  Ran forward without evading anything  ♫

556
00:48:27,950 --> 00:48:31,200
♫  Ran forward without evading anything  ♫

557
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,540
♫  Listen to the voice inside  ♫

558
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:38,400
♫  The sky has finally cleared  ♫
