1
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:28,525
[To Dear Myself]

2
00:01:30,875 --> 00:01:32,875
[Ep6]

3
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,825
I worked till 4 a.m. from last night again

4
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:36,120
Shaozi, come here

5
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:37,560
Everyone, gather here

6
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,599
Everyone, come here

7
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,080
What's up?

8
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,879
Our team is rewarded with 20,000 yuan 

9
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,159
Awesome

10
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:57,240
Sorry

11
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,479
I woke up late in the morning

12
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:00,275
Saw your message and I wanted to reply you 

13
00:03:00,275 --> 00:03:01,516
after I was in office

14
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:03,319
But I was too busy and forgot to reply you till now

15
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:04,319
Sister Siyu

16
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,800
The company rewards us

17
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,960
Calm down...

18
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,905
Team leader Li Siyu's salary will increase by 20%

19
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,479
And will be rewarded RMB 20,000

20
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:15,319
Lin Ling is rewarded 10,000 yuan

21
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:18,360
Team B will be rewarded 20,000 yuan

22
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:20,240
What? Let me see

23
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,575
To praise the outstanding performance

24
00:03:25,575 --> 00:03:28,475
and perseverance

25
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,360
Did you see it?

26
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,479
20% pay rise

27
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:40,919
And a bonus of 20,000 yuan

28
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,400
Cake...

29
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:51,360
Sister, we have to go now

30
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:51,960
Bye

31
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:58,479
An order of 500,000 yuan

32
00:03:58,479 --> 00:03:59,240
The reward of 50,000 yuan

33
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,879
Does the company have any rules?

34
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,039
The company has rules

35
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:06,392
But it doesn't work for Pan Zhiyong

36
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,319
We just do it as he says?

37
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,719
The company belongs to him only?

38
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:12,560
He is a major shareholder

39
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,919
President and general manager

40
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,079
You are also a shareholder

41
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,720
You are the vice president of the company

42
00:04:19,524 --> 00:04:23,850
I have no say in the finance department and HR department

43
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,120
I am in charge of security, customer service and sales

44
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,439
The core department of sales

45
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,102
You are impacted because of my management

46
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:36,959
Brother

47
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,639
I didn't blame you

48
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:42,480
Sit

49
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,920
Actually

50
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,100
On seniority, ability, you are the best candidate for sales director

51
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:03,783
But Pan Zhiyong rejected my proposal in the meeting

52
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,240
He insisted to select a director in this way

53
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,480
The most fundamental reason is

54
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,360
You are under my direct leadership

55
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:12,319
and you don't need to listen to him

56
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,120
You are my direct leader all along

57
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,519
Of course I listen to you

58
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:18,600
So

59
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,377
In his eyes, you are not on his side

60
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:25,725
He won't give you the post

61
00:05:27,175 --> 00:05:30,839
So Li Siyu is on his side?

62
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,639
She was not before

63
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:40,100
But after this notice, she will be

64
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,040
Siyu promised me personally

65
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,240
She won't compete with me

66
00:05:47,325 --> 00:05:51,480
Then why does she work till the early morning with her team?

67
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,720
She's going all out

68
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:59,279
You still think she won't compete with you?

69
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:01,279
Siyu won't do that

70
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,759
She values friendship

71
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,120
People will change

72
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,839
Especially in front of interests

73
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:11,425
Li Siyu is no longer the one that she used to be

74
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:15,575
Don't hesitate anymore before it's too late

75
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,720
Let me think about it

76
00:06:25,025 --> 00:06:28,319
Indecisiveness will lead to troubles

77
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:06,240
Sister Yuan

78
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,319
Sister Yuan

79
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,800
What happened?

80
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:12,125
We want to ask, anything wrong?

81
00:07:12,525 --> 00:07:14,000
Just go grab orders

82
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:30,319
Sister Yuan is watching

83
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:32,399
Come, cheers

84
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,240
Cheers

85
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:34,560
Sister Siyu

86
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,279
Cheers

87
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:36,560
Cheers

88
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,560
Thank you

89
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:38,839
Cheers

90
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:39,920
Why thank me?

91
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:41,839
You get the order

92
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:43,000
Just thank yourself

93
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,900
I can't get the order without you

94
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:50,475
No order without you, either

95
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,450
Actually before yesterday, 

96
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:05,399
I give up on my dad's disease

97
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:10,500
But after I get the order

98
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,560
I have hope again

99
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,759
As long as I don't give up

100
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,839
As long as I persist

101
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:22,000
my dad will have miracles

102
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:26,120
Lin Ling

103
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,839
Best wishes

104
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:29,599
There will be a miracle

105
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:30,680
Yes, best wishes

106
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,879
Come on

107
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,639
Come

108
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:34,519
Sign more orders with sister Siyu

109
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:36,600
Win more bonus

110
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,879
We will get better and better

111
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,240
Come on

112
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,525
So ridiculous

113
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:45,480
I declare

114
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:49,782
This time I will give my bonus to Lin Ling

115
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,720
Pay your dad's hospitalization fee

116
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,440
Sister Siyu

117
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:00,320
I'll follow you for the rest of my life

118
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:03,399
Just a little money

119
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:06,250
Look at you, didn't see much of the world

120
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,799
Sister Siyu, don't worry

121
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:11,298
I will work harder in the next three months

122
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,904
For myself, also for you

123
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,759
I will help you be the director

124
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,279
Exactly

125
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:20,559
Director...

126
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:21,360
We can do it

127
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:22,320
Come on

128
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,679
Don't say like that

129
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:26,679
We will defeat team A

130
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:28,480
And sister Siyu will become the director

131
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,639
We will win

132
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:30,960
Cheers

133
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,679
Director

134
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:38,250
I said it long ago

135
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,320
Sister Siyu will be the director

136
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:42,759
Absolutely

137
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,720
Come on

138
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,000
Come on

139
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,159
Everyone, listen

140
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:52,320
My...

141
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:57,039
My...

142
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:01,200
My stomach aches

143
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,639
Sister

144
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,240
I don't say anything

145
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,279
Let's take a picture

146
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:19,440
And we will work hard

147
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:20,480
Ok

148
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,399
Work hard

149
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:22,159
Xiaowu...

150
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:23,000
Leave it to you

151
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,879
Me...

152
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,639
Closer

153
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,039
Come...

154
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:29,559
Closer

155
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:33,279
1, 2, 3

156
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:35,840
Ok

157
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:39,279
Let's cut the cake

158
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,080
Cut the cake

159
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,080
3.5

160
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:49,399
So sweet, 23 is great

161
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,440
Want a zucchini?

162
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,320
Ok

163
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,200
Come

164
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,399
I am in a meeting

165
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:23,360
Hello, dude

166
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,320
A radish, 1.5

167
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,519
It's fresh

168
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:33,200
Edamame, right?

169
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:33,720
Correct

170
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,679
I need some

171
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:35,879
Ok, how much do you want?

172
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,600
One jin

173
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:38,399
Ok

174
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,399
Come, ten yuan

175
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,559
How much?

176
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:49,200
Ten yuan

177
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:51,559
It's 12 yuan yesterday

178
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:52,559
Why it's ten yuan today?

179
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:54,039
Dude, I lower the price, any problem?

180
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,279
It's the yesterday's edamame

181
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,480
It's still yesterday's quality

182
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,080
How can you lower the price so abruptly?

183
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,240
It doesn't sell well

184
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,320
Of course I need to lower the price

185
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,559
I don't need it

186
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:10,480
Are you crazy?

187
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:20,080
All the concerns will go after a meal

188
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,759
Otherwise, have another meal

189
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,480
So a good cooking skill

190
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,799
is the root of happiness in life

191
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,679
Burn the oil to 70% hot

192
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:31,679
Then quickly pour it on the chili rings

193
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,799
Shred green and red peppers

194
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,360
Shred green onions and green Chinese onions

195
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,725
And put shallots, ginger slices spices 

196
00:12:41,725 --> 00:12:43,725
and marinated chicken together

197
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,000
Till the chicken is fully cooked

198
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:51,440
Then soak it quickly in ice water

199
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,279
Soak dried chili in hot water

200
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,080
Ans peel marinated chicken  

201
00:12:58,559 --> 00:12:59,320
Why are you here?

202
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:00,720
You are at home

203
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:03,080
Put some pepper oil

204
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,759
Put more of it

205
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,879
Add the chicken broth

206
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,159
After mixing

207
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,720
let it stand for a while

208
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,200
Sprinkle some white sesame seeds after filling

209
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,200
You are in a meeting, right?

210
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,559
I am here at the wrong time, right?

211
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,919
This spiced chicken with chili sauce is authentic?

212
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:25,480
So if there are friends from Xinjiang?

213
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,799
Welcome to leave a comment

214
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,360
Xiaoling is right

215
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,960
Men are so unreliable

216
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,440
What?

217
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:36,840
Chen Yiming

218
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,559
Tell me the truth

219
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:41,840
Who do you cook these dishes for?

220
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,080
Myself

221
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:48,159
You still lie to me?

222
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,519
I did not lie to you

223
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:56,200
I found you had a problem for some time

224
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:57,960
I just didn't say it

225
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,039
What's wrong with me?

226
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,600
Dare you give me your phone?

227
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,600
Siyu

228
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:17,879
Siyu

229
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,000
Siyu

230
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:22,200
Siyu

231
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,480
Don't touch me...

232
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,600
No, it's not like what you think

233
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,000
Go back with me first

234
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,919
Let go -I will tell you

235
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,600
Siyu

236
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,159
Let go

237
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:35,720
Let go

238
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,159
Don't force me

239
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:40,440
I lost my job

240
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,039
I lost my job

241
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:53,720
What?

242
00:14:56,919 --> 00:14:57,559
Yes...

243
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,000
Two weeks ago

244
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:05,200
I was laid off

245
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:09,879
Impossible

246
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:12,639
Yes

247
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:14,080
Yes

248
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,440
I also think it's impossible

249
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,840
But it just happened

250
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:27,720
So...

251
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:30,000
So I have nothing to do every day

252
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:33,399
So I just cook to kill the time

253
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,360
Great

254
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,679
Great

255
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,919
Great

256
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:52,960
Are you insane?

257
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:54,679
Why do you say so?

258
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,159
You are unemployed

259
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:00,840
I thought you had an affair

260
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,679
Dad

261
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:20,720
Where's mom?

262
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:21,919
She went out

263
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,960
When did she go out?

264
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,879
After dinner

265
00:16:28,675 --> 00:16:30,000
She left you home alone

266
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,840
So ridiculous

267
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,000
Son

268
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:35,360
You're back

269
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:35,919
Mom

270
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:37,320
Did you have dinner?

271
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:39,559
I'll cook for you now

272
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:41,250
I brought your favorite...

273
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:42,440
No... mom

274
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:43,639
When did you come?

275
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,000
This afternoon

276
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,879
This afternoon?

277
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,399
Zhizhi said, you are busy 

278
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:49,879
So I didn't call you

279
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:52,240
Yuwei, I'm back  -Mom

280
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,080
You are back

281
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:55,039
You are back

282
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,650
Why you didn't tell me at the at the first time?

283
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,759
I planned to tell you after I find a new job

284
00:17:05,118 --> 00:17:06,038
Are you looking for one?

285
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,640
Yes

286
00:17:08,075 --> 00:17:09,640
I began to look for a job one day after I was fired

287
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:12,599
But I didn't find one

288
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:19,079
It's ok, just unemployment

289
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:21,125
Not a big deal

290
00:17:22,974 --> 00:17:25,919
Caijin is a sting company

291
00:17:26,175 --> 00:17:28,119
If you stay there, you will waste your life

292
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,519
It's your fortune that they fire you

293
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:35,650
A better and stronger company is waiting for you

294
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:38,359
I thought so

295
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,650
Within two weeks, I sent almost 50 emails

296
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,200
But no reply

297
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,000
The time is not come yet

298
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,559
Job hunting is the same as courtship

299
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,119
It's all about time, place and people

300
00:17:55,425 --> 00:17:57,759
Maybe I should reassess my ability now

301
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,160
No need

302
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:03,000
You are the best

303
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:04,279
No

304
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:04,960
I...

305
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,839
You can doubt yourself

306
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:09,075
But you can't doubt me

307
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,079
I have faith in the man I love

308
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,079
Siyu

309
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,160
Thank you

310
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,440
Go check it out

311
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,400
New job is knocking on the door

312
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,000
No

313
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:44,160
Go

314
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:45,680
Go

315
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,400
No

316
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:48,240
Go

317
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:53,920
Go

318
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:08,759
What is it?

319
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:17,160
I was rejected again

320
00:19:56,319 --> 00:19:58,150
I have lowered salary requirement

321
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,480
But still no company hires me

322
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:35,440
These are your favorites

323
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,640
Zhizhi called me

324
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,440
She told me Yuwei misses me

325
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,640
I miss Yuwei too

326
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:43,640
So I come here directly

327
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,519
Mom

328
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:47,700
You should have told us

329
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,096
So we can pick you up at the station

330
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,720
You carry so many things, so heavy

331
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:52,640
Not heavy, it's ok

332
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,440
I have come here for many times

333
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,319
After I get off the train, I take the bus

334
00:20:57,319 --> 00:20:59,359
Then I just get home

335
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,319
Mom, you should stay here for more days this time

336
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:04,759
You said, your heart hurts, right?

337
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:06,279
You should go to do the checkup

338
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,400
I'm fine

339
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,279
Well, Zhizhi will register for you tomorrow

340
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:11,559
No need

341
00:21:11,559 --> 00:21:13,160
I know myself

342
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:15,599
Besides, I have medicine

343
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:16,440
Look

344
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,850
Heart medicine and pain killer

345
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:22,160
The temperature varies a lot

346
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:25,350
You can drink some if you feel unwell

347
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:28,279
Mom, don't eat the wrong medicine

348
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:29,400
You should do the checkup

349
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:31,279
Ok, I got it

350
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,680
Grandma... play with me

351
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,640
I am coming

352
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:38,720
I have to play with my granddaughter

353
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,359
Mom

354
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,359
We still have to go to the hospital

355
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:44,279
We should find out the problem

356
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,079
Ok...

357
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:58,275
Why did you call my mom without telling me?

358
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,400
What are you talking about?

359
00:22:00,925 --> 00:22:03,799
It's your mom, I can't stop her

360
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:07,519
Mom said she has a heart attack

361
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:11,275
So I have to say, she should come for a checkup

362
00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:13,839
Did I do something wrong?

363
00:22:18,075 --> 00:22:20,200
I know what you are playing at

364
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:22,480
You need my mom to take care of Yuwei

365
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:25,759
So you can play around with the so-called elite moms

366
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:28,880
I do this for Yuwei

367
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:30,680
Nothing wrong

368
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,240
Ali

369
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,880
Fubu

370
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,359
This is our homespun

371
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:03,359
Nonsense

372
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,640
I have been selling cloth for many years

373
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,039
I know it so well

374
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:08,525
It's made by my machines

375
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:09,839
I know it

376
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:12,279
Uncles

377
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,119
Stop arguing

378
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:16,319
Three of it are Shaanxi homespuns

379
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,200
Impossible

380
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,119
No

381
00:23:20,575 --> 00:23:22,095
I just cut it from the loom

382
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,119
So great?

383
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,599
If it goes to the market...

384
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,200
Hello

385
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:41,880
Hello

386
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,440
Is it Mr. Chen Yiming?

387
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,279
Yes, it's me

388
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:46,640
We received your resume

389
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,359
Your experience meets our company's demand

390
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,960
Can you come this afternoon?

391
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:54,575
Our president wants to have a job interview with you

392
00:23:56,839 --> 00:23:57,759
Yes

393
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:01,425

395
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:05,960
Ok

396
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:08,599
Which company are you from?

397
00:24:09,275 --> 00:24:11,079
You will know after you see our president

398
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:27,400

00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:29,680
3:00 PM

400

3:00 PM

401
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,599
Chen

00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,319
Here

403
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,319
Siyu

404
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,039
Why are you here?

405
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:03,480
I have an interview here at 3:00 PM

406
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,559
He will come soon

407
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:05,839
Mr. Chen

408
00:26:06,075 --> 00:26:07,720
I am your interviewer

409
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:09,799
Stop it, ok?

410
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,359
Mr. Chen

411
00:26:11,775 --> 00:26:13,400
Please give me a short self-introduction

412
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,519
I have no time to play with you now

413
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:17,799
I have an appointment at 3:00 PM

414
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:21,075
Anyway, it's all on your resume

415
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:23,519
What are your strengths?

416
00:26:29,425 --> 00:26:31,183
You made the appointment with me?

417
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:35,599
How's your driving?

418
00:26:36,759 --> 00:26:37,519
Mischievous

419
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:40,839
I have an offer for you

420
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,279
You should check it out first

421
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,150
This post's salary is zero

422
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:06,319
But it has promotion

423
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:11,725
You can be promoted as father, grandfather

424
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,440
If you live long enough

425
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:19,350
you will be promoted as great grandfather

426
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,440
I know

427
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:34,160
You have been rejected during this time

428
00:27:34,759 --> 00:27:36,079
But it's not because you are not excellent enough

429
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:37,519
But because the time is yet to come

430
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,440
Look

431
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,729
Our company has an eye for you and takes initiative

432
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:48,440
So don't depressed

433
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,039
Don't look down on yourself

434
00:27:51,525 --> 00:27:55,450
Well, our company prepared a gift for you

435
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,359
What is this?

436
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,599
Open it yourself

437
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,039
Siyu

438
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:39,079
Thank you

439
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:46,440
Mr. Chen

440
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:52,052
If you are interested, please come to work with diamond ring

441
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:53,839
I believe

442
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:56,900
You will be a very good husband

443
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:11,000
Siyu

444
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:14,119
I accept the offer 

445
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,349
Also, I will accept the gift

446
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:23,680
I will go to work

447
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,119
But not now

448
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,400
Why?

449
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:38,250
Because I think I am not eligible enough

450
00:29:41,225 --> 00:29:46,079
Give me more time

451
00:29:46,525 --> 00:29:50,240
I will go to work with a real offer

452
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:10,440
Thank you

453
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,640
Thank you

454
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:13,920
Thank you

455
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:27,240
This is the introduction and brochure of the new products

456
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:28,160
How many do you want?

457
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,200
Ask sister Liu

458
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,000
Ok

459
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:31,960
Excuse me

460
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,297
This is the introduction and brochure of the new products

461
00:30:34,359 --> 00:30:35,039
Just ask sister Liu

462
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:35,640
Ok

463
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:40,720
Excuse me

464
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,119
This is the introduction and brochure of the new products

465
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:44,039
How many do you want?

466
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:45,079
Our group don't need it

467
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:46,680
HR department should keep it for us

468
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,359
Ok

469
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,079
My proposal failed

470
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:56,319
How come?

471
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,400
Impossible

472
00:30:58,799 --> 00:30:59,759
Why?

473
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,759
Miss Gu

474
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:02,160
Coming

475
00:31:04,039 --> 00:31:04,920
Serve you right

476
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,119
Come, eat more

477
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,200
Eat

478
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,839
Thanks

479
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,250
Yuwei usually eats little

480
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:25,599
Today you eat a big bowl of rice

481
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,440
Grandma's large meatball is so delicious

482
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:30,759
Ok

483
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:33,319
Thank grandma

484
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:34,599
Thank you, grandma

485
00:32:34,599 --> 00:32:35,400
You're welcome

486
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:38,000
I will cook you more in the future

487
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,440
Mom, thank you

488
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:42,079
It's ok

489
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:46,559
Liu Yang gets off work so late every day?

490
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,359
He is a little busy recently

491
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,519
So he needs to work overtime

492
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:55,680
I'm full, mom

493
00:32:56,519 --> 00:32:57,480
I have to go out

494
00:32:58,575 --> 00:33:01,079
Help me take care of Yuwei

495
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:01,680
Ok

496
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,640
Go...

497
00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:04,640
She can't eat peanuts

498
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,400
Can't watch too much TV

499
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,400
Ok

500
00:33:08,599 --> 00:33:10,279
Don't worry

501
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,079
Be a good girl

502
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:13,480
Bye

503
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,200
Go...

504
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,559
You are back

505
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:22,839
So fragrant

506
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:23,559
You are back

507
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,799
Go, wash your hands

508
00:33:26,125 --> 00:33:27,880
I cooked your favorite dishes

509
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,599
Go out?

510
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,960
Mom is here, she won't disturb you

511
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,079
Hurry...

512
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,400
Where is your mom going?

513
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:52,600
Prepare the party with Miaomiao's mom

514
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,160
What do you mean?

515
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,920
I love mom

516
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,039
I don't understand what you are talking about

517
00:33:58,319 --> 00:33:59,200
Mom, stop asking

518
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,079
Never mind it

519
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:02,880
Ok, hurry

520
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,640
The dishes are getting cold

521
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,279
Wash my hands first

522
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,679
These are available online

523
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:17,920
It's half cheaper than here

524
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,675
I don't like buying things online

525
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:25,079
Linda's mom gives a budget

526
00:34:25,875 --> 00:34:29,125
Every family needs to hand in 1500 yuan

527
00:34:29,518 --> 00:34:30,518
Do you think it's low?

528
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,400
1500

529
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,159
Still low?

530
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,300
If it's 3000, we can invite 

531
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,850
foreign children's drama clubs to perform

532
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:42,800
If it's 1500, only domestic clubs

533
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,280
They will do the makeups and wear masks

534
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,320
it's hard to tell it's domestic or foreign

535
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,360
A big difference

536
00:34:50,675 --> 00:34:54,159
One is London's accent, one is New York's accent

537
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,880
It's two different things

538
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:56,840
Really?

539
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:01,416
By the way, Yuwei's mom

540
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:03,719
Did Yuwei tell me

541
00:35:04,039 --> 00:35:05,880
Doudou fought against others?

542
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:07,840
No

543
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,025
Miaomiao cried many times for it

544
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,440
She told me Doudou often pulls her hair

545
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:15,599
Even kicks her

546
00:35:18,039 --> 00:35:20,000
Did you tell the teacher?

547
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:22,039
Yes, but it's useless

548
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,440
Today Doudou still grabbed her toys

549
00:35:26,039 --> 00:35:26,840
Really?

550
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:32,175
What kind of people are Doudou's parents?

551
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:34,559
Such a brat

552
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,686
Did you see team B's sales performance this month?

553
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,480
What did you eat for dinner?

554
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:26,960
Did you finish your homework?

555
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,239
Did you recite the book?

556
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,519
And vocabulary

557
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,480
Ok

558
00:37:40,199 --> 00:37:40,920
Leave it there

559
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:43,159
I'll sign it after I go back

560
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,280
Sister Yuan is here

561
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,519
Go ahead

562
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,000
Sister Yuan

563
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,119
Team B is going crazy now

564
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,320
Yes, sister Yuan

565
00:37:55,519 --> 00:37:57,599
Lin Ling works till midnight every day

566
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:00,320
Their interns are so workaholic

567
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:01,920
Xia Xiaotian is the most ridiculous

568
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,199
She even harassed my client

569
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,199
This is exactly what someone wants

570
00:38:06,675 --> 00:38:10,900
But as I know, Xia Xiaotian outperforms Huang Bibo this month 

571
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:12,559
Really?

572
00:38:12,875 --> 00:38:14,925
As I know, Jia Shu the top saleman of Degao battery 

573
00:38:14,925 --> 00:38:16,744
will come to our company

574
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,599
And he demands to go to Li Siyu's team

575
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:23,679
If it's true, I am afraid we can't outcompete them

576
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:25,400
You underestimate sister Yuan

577
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,679
But Li Siyu has a strong momentum now

578
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:30,760
Sister Yuan

579
00:38:31,175 --> 00:38:32,865
We can't take it lightly

580
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,875
Li Siyu is no longer the one that used to be

581
00:38:41,239 --> 00:38:43,675
Don't hesitate anymore before it's too late

582
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,880
Cheers

583
00:38:53,525 --> 00:38:56,344
My goal today is 5 effective visits

584
00:38:56,719 --> 00:38:59,075
Then I will continue to contact Alaide company

585
00:38:59,425 --> 00:39:02,079
I will contact the new clients

586
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:02,719
Come in

587
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,039
Sister Siyu

588
00:39:04,039 --> 00:39:05,840
Vice president Fang wants to see you

589
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,000
Ok, excuse me

590
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,850
This is great

591
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:18,960
This is the last month

592
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,039
VP Fang

593
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:26,079
Mr. Zhou

594
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:27,360
Siyu, sit down

595
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,519
Zhou has something to tell you

596
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:35,275
You gave this to finance department last month?

597
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:37,519
Yes

598
00:39:38,039 --> 00:39:40,925
What's going on with 500 yuan ticket?

599
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:44,654
You want to reimburse PR fee on 25th

600
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,075
But this invoice is on the 4th day of last month

601
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,159
This 500 yuan is for overtime

602
00:39:50,625 --> 00:39:52,760
We have another application process for overtime pay

603
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,960
That's because application process for overtime pay is 

604
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:55,719
too complicated

605
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,239
So I used meal invoice

606
00:39:57,639 --> 00:39:59,039
Sister Yuan knows about this

607
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,599
This is her signature

608
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,327
You think you can get away with it 

609
00:40:02,327 --> 00:40:04,327
just because you have her signature?

610
00:40:04,675 --> 00:40:07,119
What do you mean?

611
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,880
You cheated the PR fee

612
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,199
I am a good salewoman

613
00:40:12,199 --> 00:40:13,760
I don't need to cheat 500 yuan, ok?

614
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:17,159
You have commissions of several hundred thousand yuan

615
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,519
Now you want to take advantage of the company

616
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,480
I have seen a lot of people like this

617
00:40:21,639 --> 00:40:22,639
How can you say so?

618
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:23,880
I have evidence

619
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:25,519
Please investigate it in sales department 

620
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:26,599
before you makde the conclusion

621
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:29,500
Li Siyu, you think we can't punish you 

622
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,320
just because you are a team leader?

623
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:32,920
Whatever

624
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:34,480
I didn't cheat and I mean it

625
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,039
All right

626
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:36,840
Zhou

627
00:40:37,559 --> 00:40:38,679
You two go out first

628
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,159
I need to talk to Li Siyu alone

629
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:53,719
Li Siyu

630
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:55,639
Sit down

631
00:41:09,239 --> 00:41:09,960
Li Siyu

632
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,872
We have checked all your invoices

633
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:17,320
You cheated over 7000 yuan

634
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:19,800
It's overtime pay

635
00:41:20,199 --> 00:41:21,159
Strictly speaking

636
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,320
it's a fraud

637
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:24,719
And the crime of embezzlement

638
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,199
The whole sales department is committing crimes these years

639
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:30,079
But they didn't report others

640
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:32,119
They only report you, Li Siyu

641
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:39,975
These data are in my office now

642
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:42,400
According to the finance department, 

643
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,950
we should call the police

644
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,400
I have consulted the lawyers

645
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,679
The amount exceeds 5000 yuan

646
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:48,559
According to the criminal law

647
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:49,920
you have to be sentenced to at least three years

648
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:51,079
What?

649
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:55,199
If it's true, your life will be ruined

650
00:41:59,679 --> 00:42:00,920
Let's be honest

651
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:04,950
You made a lot of contributions here these years

652
00:42:05,925 --> 00:42:07,800
We don't want to go hard on you

653
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,400
We want to be lenient

654
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:12,525
As long as you resign

655
00:42:12,525 --> 00:42:15,440
we will let bygones be bygones

656
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:19,639
I will not resign

657
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,159
Why?

658
00:42:22,475 --> 00:42:24,606
Because I never cheated a penny

659
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:26,960
You still deny it

660
00:42:27,159 --> 00:42:28,199
I did not do anything

661
00:42:28,199 --> 00:42:29,239
Why should I admit it?

662
00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:30,920
So we have to call the police

663
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:31,480
Have it your way

664
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,320
You

665
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:37,125
You know, you still need to leave even if the police come?

666
00:42:37,125 --> 00:42:38,679
Till then, everyone will know it

667
00:42:38,679 --> 00:42:39,960
Our company brand will be affected

668
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,719
You still want to stand in this industry?

669
00:42:42,719 --> 00:42:44,559
I believe the police will prove my innocence

670
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:45,800
You think you can withstand the investigation?

671
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:46,800
If I can't stand the investigation

672
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,320
the whole sales department won't either

673
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,280
You want to get all of them implicated?

674
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,960
I can tell you, it's impossible

675
00:42:54,175 --> 00:42:55,880
Today we have only one solution

676
00:42:56,239 --> 00:42:57,480
You need to resign

677
00:42:58,119 --> 00:43:00,325
I will never resign because of the invoice

678
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:09,760
Li Siyu

679
00:43:10,679 --> 00:43:12,199
The company has given you a chance

680
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,125
If you insist, you can't blame us
