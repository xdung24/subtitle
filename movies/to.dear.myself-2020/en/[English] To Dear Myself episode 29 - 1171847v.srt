[To Dear Myself]

3
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,900
[Episode 29]

4
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:39,600
Twenty years ago, I quit my job to start up my own business.

5
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,400
Everyone said that I was crazy.

6
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,800
Fourteen years ago, I invested all my money into the research and development of Lubao1.

7
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,000
You all said that I was crazy once again.

8
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Within five years, I insisted that Lubao must be transformed and upgraded.

9
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You all still said that I was crazy.

10
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Reality proves that I am not crazy and that I succeeded.

11
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,200
President Pan,

12
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,200
the market before is different from the current one.

13
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,200
But courage and insight

14
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,800
are never irrelevant in any era, right?

15
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:14,600
President Pan, cautiousness is also something that doesn't become outdated.

16
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,300
President Wang, that is a requirement of the financial industry you're in.

17
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,200
For us industrialists, we only have one way,

18
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,000
that is pressing forward with an indomitable will.

19
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,600
With all due respect, there are many ways to make Lubao great,

20
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,800
yet you chose the dumbest and riskiest way.

21
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,800
But it's the most effective one.

22
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,400
Wait five years before making any money?

23
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,700
It's too slow.

24
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,200
President Wang,

25
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,600
if you want to make money quickly, you shouldn't have invested in Lubao at the beginning.

26
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,400
Because the original goal of creating Lubao,

27
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,400
is not to make money but to make history!

28
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,200
It's settled! The next step for Lubao

29
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,200
is to create another industrial zone and another production line!

30
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,200
I object.

31
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,400
Invalid objection.

32
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,800
Whether the objection is valid or invalid, let's vote by a show of hands.

33
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,300
Very well.

34
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,200
If you agree to creating another

35
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,600
two production lines for Lubao3, please raise your hand.

36
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,250
4 votes.

37
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:29,200
Fang Zhan, are you abstaining?

38
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,330
I vote to object.

39
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:41,490
I object.

40
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,300
Five votes of objection.

41
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Since the result is out, let's discuss the next thing on the agenda.

42
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,200
Let's discuss President Wang's proposal to revise our business layout and create a concept for the future.

43
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,800
First, let's have President Wang to introduce the context of the proposal to us.

44
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,300
Okay.

45
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,900
Chairman, every board director—

46
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,700
There's no need for an introduction.

47
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:18,600
I object. According to the company's rules,

48
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,000
when the board of directors

49
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,800
is discussing important issues, the chairman doesn't have the ultimate decision-making power

50
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,000
but he has the right to veto.

51
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,800
For over ten years, I have never used this right.

52
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,900
But I decided to use it today.

53
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:38,000
Moreover, I will use it often from now on!

54
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,800
I have finally seen Pan Zhiyong's forceful way of ruling today.

55
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,500
This is his style.

56
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,400
Don't make any money in the next five years? I can't believe that he said that!

57
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,800
Making money has never been Pan Zhiyong's priority.

58
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,600
But as an investor,

59
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,000
my money didn't come to me from nowhere! (T/N: lit. the wind didn't blow money to me)

60
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,400
I have countless limited partners behind me!

61
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,400
They have certain performance requirements for me!

62
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,800
Does Lubao really have such a rule?

63
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,200
Yes.

64
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,800
It was created when the company was founded.

65
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,800
But we have never used it so I almost forgot about it.

66
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,600
Can we change it?

67
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,100
That would be very difficult.

68
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,400
You have worked with Pan Zhiyong for over 10 years,

69
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,200
do you have any methods that can be used to persuade him?

70
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,200
That's basically impossible.

71
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,600
He is very stubborn. Once he has made a decision,

72
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,000
nobody can stop him.

73
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,300
What a coincidence.

74
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:04,100
There is also no one who can stop me from doing what I want to do.

75
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,400
What's up?

76
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,570
What are you looking at that you must hide?

77
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,800
I asked, what's up?

78
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:32,570
I came to hand in my homework.

79
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,500
Go away!

80
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,600
For once, you are reliable.

81
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,200
That's it?

82
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,200
What else do you want?

83
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,400
No salary increase?

84
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,400
Didn't you just want a job with a low salary?

85
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,800
Why are you asking for a salary increase?

86
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,400
Well... the premise of a low salary is little work.

87
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,100
How much work have you assigned me recently?

88
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,300
Yes,

89
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,400
you did promise me that I could come in late and leave early. I left at 3:00 p.m.

90
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,600
But at 11:30 p.m. at night, you still sent voice messages to me in regards to work.

91
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,300
Why shouldn't I ask for a salary increase?

92
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,500
Rest assured.

93
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,000
Once Laidianle launches online, you will get the reward you deserve.

94
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,800
You better keep your word.

95
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,900
Why aren't you leaving yet?

96
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:28,000
I think you should give me a few more praises.

97
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,400
Your performance has been well recently.

98
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,200
Continue to do so.

99
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:42,120
Older Sister President Li,

100
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,000
you haven't been scolding people as much as before.

101
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,400
Your performance has been well recently. Continue to do so.

102
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,000
That's all for today.

103
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,800
The meeting is over.

104
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,200
Chen Yiming, stay.

105
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,600
Go somewhere with me.

106
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,900
You don't need to take that.

107
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,200
Okay.

108
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:52,640
President Wang, where are we going?

109
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
President Wang, I think you should tell me in advance so I am prepared.

110
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,630
Get into the car.

111
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,200
Oh, Sister Ziru, you're here. How can I help you today?

112
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,800
Today, it's not me but he who needs a haircut.

113
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,800
Come here. Help this gentlemen wash his hair.

114
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,600
- President Wang, I— 
 - Go on.

115
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,800
Hello, this way please.

116
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,570
Go.

117
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,400
This way to wash your hair.

118
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,900
Watch the steps, please.

119
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,200
It's not too tight, right?

120
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,800
This is fine.

121
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,200
How would you like to have your hair cut today?

122
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,600
You decide. I'm fine with anything.

123
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,000
All done.

124
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:38,800
This is the Chen Yiming who wants to overturn the brand strategy of Tianye Group.

125
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,000
This is the deputy director that I look fondly upon.

126
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,800
Miss Gu.

127
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,500
Thank you.

128
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,100
The crepe here is quite delicious.

129
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,600
To be honest, it's just okay.

130
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,800
Our family used to have a chef who made desserts

131
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,200
that were amazing.

132
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,400
So are you still able to eat that chef's desserts nowadays?

133
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,200
If I want to eat them, I'd have to go to France.

134
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,900
He is from Marseilles. He went back after he retired.

135
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,000
I quite like France.

136
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I don't like it.

137
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,200
The overall feel of Europe right now

138
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,600
is that it has fallen behind.

139
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,600
If my family didn't do business there, then I would never go there.

140
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,100
Then, where's your favorite place?

141
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,600
To be honest,

142
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,700
when I left the country at age 18, I was very unwilling.

143
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:40,500
What I like most are the Han and Tang dynasties.
 (T/N: Han and Tang Dynasty are considered as the most prosperous dynasties in China.)

144
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,000
Those are what you would call magnificent.

145
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,200
What year did you go abroad?

146
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,600
In the year 1986.

147
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,400
That year you... were 18?

148
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,000
I'm 51 years old this year.

149
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:12,560
Is the proposal that I want done?

150
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,500
No.

151
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,400
Tonight, before 12:00, you must send it to me.

152
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Then I'll wait till 2:00 in the morning for you to finish it.

153
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,300
If at 2:00 a.m., you still can't turn it in to me,

154
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:31,800
then I will drive to your house and hit you in the middle of the night.

155
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,700
Let me bother you for five minutes.

156
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,600
Today, I met a guy.

157
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,200
Out of all the men I've met in the past six months, he has the best conditions.

158
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,000
What category does he belong in?

159
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
He belongs to the category of "born with a good life"

160
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,600
and "social climber." We added each other's WeChat.

161
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,200
In my experience,

162
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,800
we should exchange at least a few words on WeChat after the date,

163
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,400
but after the date, he hasn't sent any messages.

164
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,800
He doesn't like you then.

165
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,200
There's no way. We had a really good conversation at dinner.

166
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,600
If you think you have a chance with him,

167
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,200
and he doesn't contact you, then you contact him.

168
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:59,900
That... would that make me seem like I have no self-restraint?

169
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,800
From a sales perspective,

170
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,900
it is never wrong to take initiative.

171
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,170
Have...

172
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,300
you...

173
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,200
slept yet?

174
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,000
What are you doing?

175
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,600
This bastard deleted me!

176
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,800
What happened?

177
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:47,000
Are you laughing at me? You're laughing at me! He deleted me and you're laughing! What's wrong with you?!

178
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,400
He doesn't like you!

179
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,400
How is that possible? I'm so good-looking, how could he not like me?

180
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,400
Ms. Gu, hello.

181
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,800
Where is Sister Zhou?

182
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,800
Hi, Ms. Gu, I'm here.

183
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:12,000
Sister Zhou, is number 57 whom you introduced to me a swindler?

184
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
What kind of nonsense is that? Did you have some kind of misunderstanding?

185
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,800
Here, don't be too anxious yet. Let's sit over there and talk about it.

186
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,000
Let's go.

187
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Bring me the iPad.

188
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,800
Thank you, Sister Zhou. We're leaving now.

189
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,400
Wish you guys happiness! Bye.

190
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,800
Sit here, sit here, sit here.

191
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,600
Let's take a look.

192
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,800
The number 57 you mentioned...

193
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,800
Is it this Mr. Zhao?

194
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,000
Yes. It's him.

195
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,200
You guys went out on a date?

196
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,400
Yes.

197
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:49,700
When we met up, we got along pretty well, but the second we separated, he blocked me.

198
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,000
Say, doesn't this kind of action mean that he is a swindler?

199
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,400
How can he possibly be a swindler?

200
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,800
Then that makes no sense.

201
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,200
We even made plans to go to the Arctic Pole to see penguins together.

202
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,600
Two hours later, I couldn't contact him in any way.

203
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,800
It is pretty strange. How about this? Don't panic just yet. I'll ask for you.

204
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,200
I'm sure there's some sort of misunderstanding.

205
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,700
Fine. Turn on the speaker.

206
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,200
All right. No problem.

207
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,800
Hello, I'm Jerry.

208
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,000
Hello, are you Mr. Zhao?

209
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,400
I'm  Miss Zhou from the "Turns Out to be You" Club.

210
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,100
Oh, Miss Zhou. What's the matter?

211
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,200
Oh, it's like this.

212
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,800
I want to collect some feedback from you.

213
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,400
When you and Ms. Gu met,

214
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,000
did you have good feelings?

215
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,400
She's quite pretty. We got along pretty well.

216
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:47,400
Do you think there is a chance that you two would further develop the relationship?

217
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,200
I think being friends is okay.

218
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,600
As for marriage, she seems a little old.

219
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,800
You feel that she's too old?

220
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,200
I prefer girls under the age of 25.

221
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,000
I didn't even mind that you're too old! I—

222
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,600
- Ms. Gu. 
 - Please give me a moment to calm down.

223
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,800
Ms. Gu. Drink some tea. Don't be angry.

224
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,400
How old do I look to you?

225
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,000
26. At most 26.

226
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,600
Let's do this.

227
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,600
I have a 58-year-old professor with over ¥100 million in assets I can introduce to you.

228
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,600
His conditions are very good, and he likes women like you, around age 30.

229
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,800
He should be able to—

230
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:48,400
Have I gotten to the point where only old men will like me?

231
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,990
Ms. Gu. You know this,

232
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
a woman's age is inversely proportional to her value.

233
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,600
For men, age doesn't matter as much.

234
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,900
You just said I look to be at most 26 years old.

235
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,600
No matter how good you preserve yourself,

236
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,700
your ID is still there.

237
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,600
- This one is nice. I want this one. Send it to me, send it to me. 
 - Sure.

238
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,600
I will send it to you.

239
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,800
Yeah. Yeah...

240
00:19:56,100 --> 00:20:01,400
[Do you want to know the secret to eternal youth?]

241
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,000
[Caijin Company]

242
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:41,850
Come pick me up.

243
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,800
I knew something good would happen today.

244
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,200
Did you win the lottery or buy new stocks?

245
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,800
The things you say,

246
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,800
so vulgar.

247
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,600
Then, what's the good thing that is happening?

248
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,800
- Hey, hey, hey. 
 - What?

249
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:05,400
I'm leaving. Cover up for me if the boss comes over here.

250
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,500
Bye-bye.

251
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,800
Don't be afraid! I'm here to save you.

252
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,200
Aren't you being a bit dramatic?

253
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,600
It's rare of you to twist an ankle, can't I cherish this moment for a bit?

254
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,700
What are you saying?

255
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,900
Look.  Which do you like?

256
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,800
Put the ice pack on it first.

257
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,200
Give me your foot. Slowly.

258
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,800
How did you sprain it? It looks so severe. Does it hurt?

259
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,800
It hurts!

260
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,400
What are you doing?

261
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,400
Bare with me.

262
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,300
Endure it, endure it.

263
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,110
Mommy! Butterfly!

264
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:54,720
Yuwei! Yuwei, don't move! No! Yuwei!

265
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,880
I'll help you catch the butterfly, okay? Don't move!

266
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,820
You can't catch butterflies like this ever again, got it?

267
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,240
What did you go out to do?

268
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,500
I went to buy groceries.

269
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,470
How could you leave Yuwei home all alone?

270
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:34,010
You didn't even close the window! An accident almost happened!

271
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,930
It was just the market downstairs. I figured I would be back in five minutes.

272
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:42,650
Even if it's only five minutes, that's not okay!

273
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:45,710
She's so small and full of energy! She also doesn't know what dangerous is!

274
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:48,240
You can't tear your gaze from her for even five seconds!

275
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:54,880
Also, the downstairs market's

276
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,490
vegetables cost ¥0.50 more than the vegetables at the farmer's market!

277
00:24:57,490 --> 00:25:00,800
The cost of scallion, ginger, and garlic are double there!

278
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,230
If you don't know how to buy things, then don't buy them from now on!

279
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:21,810
Yuwei, you can't climb that high again, do you understand?

280
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:23,970
It's very dangerous.

281
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:27,330
Daddy is so pitiful.

282
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:29,000
Why are you saying that?

283
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,380
You scolded Daddy, and Daddy didn't say a single thing.

284
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:47,720
Here. Put on your shoes.

285
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,670
Go play in your room, okay?

286
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:15,790
My tone of voice was a little too harsh just now.

287
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:29,930
There's something I need to tell you.

288
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:35,790
There is a Fangcao Kindergarten in the Changsheng Community.

289
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:39,400
I'm planning on transferring Yuwei there.

290
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:50,080
I know that kindergarten. It's a lot worse than Lantian Kindergarten.

291
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:54,040
Their facilities are a bit worse

292
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:57,890
but the tuition is half of the other.

293
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:07,730
Zhizhi,

294
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:12,880
I was opposed to you sending Yuwei to Jinguduo Kindergarten

295
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:17,360
was because the people there were in a much higher social class than us,

296
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:21,520
but isn't this Fangcao Kindergarten

297
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:26,400
a little too low for our social class?

298
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:34,660
Before, we weren't good enough for Jinguduo

299
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:38,000
and now we can't even afford Lantian.

300
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,450
Except for Fangcao, we don't have any other choices.

301
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,430
I'm sorry.

302
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,580
It's all my fault,

303
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:02,330
but I still...

304
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:07,840
worry that if Yuwei goes, she won't be used to it.

305
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:12,460
She will eventually get used to it.

306
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:16,020
Zhizhi.

307
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,120
During this period of time, you've worked hard.

308
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:46,310
Didn't the old Chinese medicine doctor tell you to avoid certain foods?

309
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,010
You are nagging so much.

310
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,190
Can you drink less?

311
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,700
Drink it!

312
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,900
Can't you drink less?

313
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,130
Pour it for me!

314
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:08,590
- Don't drink so much! 
 - Pour!

315
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:11,910
Pour. I'll pour it.

316
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:14,550
You're going to drink to your death. Come on! Drink up!

317
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:20,940
Lei Haowen,

318
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:24,090
I'm going to ask you something and you must answer me honestly.

319
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:30,550
Giving you an honest answer depends on the method of torture you will use on me.

320
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:34,300
Pepper spray and torture-rack don't work on me.

321
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,280
If you use seduction,

322
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:41,350
I will give in and answer you honestly. I will also give in to your seduction.

323
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:52,830
Say, how old do I look?

324
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:58,170
If you stop drinking, I will tell you.

325
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:04,720
If I say that you look like you're 18 years old,

326
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,860
it seems like I have ulterior motives for you.

327
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:10,450
If I say you are 26 years old,

328
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:14,800
it seems like I am jealous of you and depreciate you.

329
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,600
So to be transparent and fair,

330
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,550
you are 24 years old.

331
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:24,330
I'm young and pretty, yet why

332
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:26,490
am I still not married?

333
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:28,530
Perhaps, the one who you are fated to be with has not appeared yet.

334
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:31,040
When will the fated one appear then?

335
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:36,830
There is another possibility. The fated one has appeared.

336
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:40,410
But you haven't realized it.

337
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:45,500
Stop drinking!

338
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:48,600
- What are you doing? 
 - Stop drinking!

339
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,320
You aren't listening to me! Gu Xiaoling!

340
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,910
Nobody wants to marry me anyway! Why did you take my beer?

341
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:03,400
Gu Xiaoling, can you please have some pride?

342
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:07,260
Didn't you say that you wanted to fight for 10 more years? How long is it has just been?

343
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:15,400
What's wrong? What do you want to do?

344
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,400
Don't put your face on the table. It's dirty.

345
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,200
Get up. Get up.

346
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:30,230
Fight for another 10 years?

347
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:36,600
Fight for another 10 years then I will be 40 years old.

348
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,810
It'll be even harder for me to get married!

349
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,720
The table is dirty.

350
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:49,960
Get up to talk, okay?

351
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:55,080
If you want to get married, wouldn't it be easy?

352
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,610
Stop crying.

353
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:08,840
I don't like any of the people who like me.

354
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:12,620
All the people I like don't like me.

355
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:16,370
Stop crying.

356
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,400
If you keep crying, you won't be beautiful.

357
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,400
Don't cry, okay?

358
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:27,970
If you continue to cry, I-I...

359
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:30,770
I will take ugly pictures of you and make them into memes.

360
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:34,280
I'll post them on my Wechat moments. My goodness, look here!

361
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,760
Lei Haowen, you dare?

362
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,590
You will see if I dare or not! I'm taking the picture!

363
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:41,970
You think if you turn around I can't take pictures? Keep crying. I'll take more.

364
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:44,510
From all angles.

365
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:47,580
This angle. Cry, cry. Continue to cry.

366
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,960
Unless you promise me you'll stop crying. Here, take a selfie.

367
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,250
Hey! Y-y-you, sit down.

368
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:54,550
Only if you promise to stop crying.

369
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,480
Sit down.

370
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:03,150
That's right. Don't cry. Let's eat, okay?

371
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:07,460
Don't cry anymore, okay? Here, I'll get you some vegetables.

372
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:11,100
Lately, I have been really frustrated.

373
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,380
Really frustrated?

374
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:17,210
Lately, I have been really, really, really frustrated.

375
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:21,840
Yes, very frustrated. Very frustrated.

376
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:27,260
Ugh, I want-I want to find a boyfriend.

377
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:29,920
I want to get married!

378
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,810
God!

379
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:35,670
Please find her a boyfriend! Don't let her go crazy!

380
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:40,350
God! Where is my man! Give him to me quickly!

381
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:47,570
I want... I want to eat this!

382
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:49,020
This?

383
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:50,300
Up there!

384
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:54,350
Okay, no problem. I'll help you pick them.

385
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,040
Which one?

386
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,780
Up there. That one.

387
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:03,300
- This one? 
 - Yes.

388
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:10,450
- Are you okay, Xiaoling? 
 - Lei Haowen, hurry and come pick me up.

389
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:12,930
Come bite me, come bite me.

390
00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:15,370
How come there's another one?

391
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:19,700
Lei Haowen! You heartless asshole!

392
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:23,210
- Come, come, come. There's more than one dog. Come on, I'll carry you. 
  - Hurry, come here!

393
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:27,970
Lei Haowen, my crutches! Hurry, hurry!

394
00:34:27,970 --> 00:34:31,950
Run! Run quickly!

395
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:41,000
How is it? Did the three dogs follow us?

396
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,300
No. They didn't follow us.

397
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:50,000
I'm so tired. So tired, so tired.

398
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,200
Why are you laughing?

399
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:18,900
My mood suddenly became better.

400
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,900
Say,

401
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:35,600
I asked god for a man.

402
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:39,400
Why did he give me some cherries?

403
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,800
Cherries are good.

404
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:48,400
In Chinese traditional culture,

405
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,700
cherry means "cherish the people who are in front of you."

406
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,000
Is that true?

407
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,400
Of course, it's true.

408
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,300
Even Confusious

409
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:08,800
once said, cherry

410
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,800
represents tying the knot with a man.

411
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,600
It's known to be propriety, justice, honesty, and honor.

412
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,800
Stop the nonsense.

413
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:23,200
Really! Really.

414
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,600
Really!

415
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,400
Keep the show on your good foot to use.

416
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,500
Stop being so noisy!

417
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,800
Liu Yuwei's  mom,

418
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:53,600
the financial department informed us that they haven't received Liu Yuwei's living expenses for next season.

419
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:58,200
Please pay as soon as possible so her schooling won't get affected.

420
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:28,400
Manager Hu, is there a chance I can switch to another position?

421
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:51,600
I don't want to go to this kindergarten. I want to go to the original one!

422
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:56,400
Yuwei, be good. This one is also good.

423
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,400
I don't want to! I don't want to!

424
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:04,800
I want Teacher Dai and Teacher Liu. I want to play with Susan.

425
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:10,600
I want to play with Xiaoxiao and Older Brother Haohao.

426
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:18,200
Yuwei, be good! This kindergarten also has many good teachers.

427
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:21,800
It also has many other good kids!

428
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,800
Yuwei, be good! If you don't go inside, I'm going to be late.

429
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,900
I don't want to! I don't want to!

430
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,200
Teacher, what should we do?

431
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,200
All kids are like this on their first day of kindergarten.

432
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:37,300
It depends on whether the parents can walk away or not.

433
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,400
Come on.

434
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,400
Mom! Do you not want me anymore?!

435
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:52,400
Don't leave me!

436
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,800
Mom, don't leave me!

437
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,800
Hello, President Wang?

438
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,400
Yiming, are you at the company?

439
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,800
Yes, I'm here.

440
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,200
I'm in my office.

441
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:13,800
I have a problem. You're the only one who can help me out.

442
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,400
Okay. I'll go up there right away.

443
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,000
Great.

444
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:27,200
The files in here are all very important.

445
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,100
If I ask anyone else to fix it, I won't be at ease.

446
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:35,690
Let me try to insert this memory bank again.

447
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,400
Why exactly won't the computer turn on?

448
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:47,000
I just checked. There are no problems with the memory bank and mainboard.

449
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,400
Perhaps it's the system.

450
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:52,000
It was working fine yesterday...

451
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:06,000
It's fixed!

452
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,400
I didn't plug in the charger correctly?

453
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,100
I think so.

454
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,200
It's fixed.

455
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,700
Am I really stupid?

456
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,200
If you're stupid, then this world does not have smart people.

457
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,800
Don't tell anyone else about this.

458
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,400
This is a little secret between us.

459
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,400
I won't. I definitely will not tell anyone else.

460
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,500
Don't lie to me.

461
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,700
We clearly sold ¥20 million, but you want me to write it as ¥100 million, is—

462
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,000
Director Fang. Director Yuan. I'm leaving.

463
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,800
Bye-bye.

464
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,200
Isn't that falsifying information?

465
00:40:55,700 --> 00:41:00,200
This is not falsifying information. This is called creating data.

466
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,600
Pan Zhiyong will not agree with us doing this.

467
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,800
This is a decision I made with President Wang.

468
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,800
Which President Wang?

469
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,200
She's an expert in this area.

470
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,800
But right now, Sales is managed by Pan Zhiyong.

471
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:17,400
He checks the report every day. He also comes to my office to ask me.

472
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:21,000
If there are any differences, we will not be able to keep them a secret from him.

473
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Then we'll make two versions.

474
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,700
One will be for him to see, and the other will be for us to use.

475
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,300
This...

476
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,200
This type of thing... I've never done it before.

477
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,200
This concerns your own interest as well.

478
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:43,600
You will get your equity very soon. If Lubao's valuation increases,

479
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:46,400
your assets will also increase accordingly.

480
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:55,600
Xiaoling said that Siyu's company will be launching online next Monday.

481
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:02,650
She always feels like there is a wolf chasing her.

482
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:07,200
Xiaoling also tries to persuade her to not wear herself out.

483
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,600
Of course, she can't be persuaded.

484
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:15,150
Gu Xiaoling has recently been very hurt by her blind dates.

485
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:19,900
Do you think I should take advantage of the situation right now and swoop in?

486
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:26,200
Lei Haowen, if you're looking to die, then go ahead. I'm not going to stop you.

487
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:34,100
Quick, greet your uncles.

488
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,800
Yuwei, how come you came?

489
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,000
Do you miss me?

490
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,600
Zhizhi said that she had to go out, so I offered to take care of Yuwei,

491
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:46,000
but you guys suddenly asked to meet up and I really wanted to see you guys.

492
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,600
Isn't this place not very suitable for children? How about we go somewhere else instead?

493
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:52,400
It's no problem, I'm friends with the boss here.

494
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,000
Yuwei, Uncle will order a juice for you. Okay?

495
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,200
Sit.

496
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,900
Has Yuwei gotten used to her new kindergarten yet?

497
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,200
For the past two days, she's stopped crying,

498
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,800
but I can clearly feel

499
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,800
that she's very unhappy.

500
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,600
Well, how are the people at the new kindergarten?

501
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:17,650
They're all right.

502
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:24,600
At the time, I really should have listened to you.

503
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:29,100
If I had switched positions and gained some professional skill,

504
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:34,400
then I wouldn't have to let Yuwei suffer so much right now.

505
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:37,100
You were not confident at the time.

506
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Thinking about it now,

507
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,300
I was actually just lazy.

508
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:48,400
I always felt that as long as I had Liu Yang to rely on,

509
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:52,800
I would be able to live life no matter what happened.

510
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,100
Who would have known that

511
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:58,400
Liu Yang is unreliable at times

512
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,800
and that

513
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,300
it would be so hard to get by each day.

514
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:06,000
In this world,

515
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,200
you can't rely on anybody but yourself.

516
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,800
How are you and Liu Yang?

517
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:25,200
All right.

518
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:29,400
The other day,

519
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:33,800
he suddenly said sorry to me.

520
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:38,600
He also said "you've worked hard" to me.

521
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:46,400
Say, we've been together for so many years

522
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,800
and he has never spoken like that to me.

523
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,300
Now when we are almost divorced,

524
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:59,000
he suddenly said that to me.

525
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,300
I really don't know

526
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:07,230
if I should feel happy or helpless.

527
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,200
I can only say, people will change.

528
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:18,700
That's right. People must change.

529
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:21,000
All people will grow old.

530
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,400
Why are you so sentimental?

531
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,000
I'm not. I don't have time for that.

532
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,600
I've been racking my brain thinking of better ways

533
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:33,400
to hold onto the person who I want.

536
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:44,000
♫  How are you?  ♫

537
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,800
♫  Listen to me about the latest news  ♫

538
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:52,200
♫  Some sweet and some hopeless  ♫

539
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:57,200
♫  There are also some that were never said  ♫

540
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:00,800
♫  It's been so long, I've already learned to let go  ♫

541
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:05,200
♫  Let go of obsessions, of the present, and of greed  ♫

542
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:10,300
♫  Yet I've never thought of letting you go  ♫

543
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:13,800
♫  Yeah…  ♫

544
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,800
♫  Oh…  ♫

545
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,000
♫  En…  ♫

546
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
♫  Letting go…  ♫

547
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,400
♫  Dear Myself  ♫

548
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:26,600
♫  Listen to the voice inside  ♫

549
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:30,600
♫  In this lonely world, be cautious ♫

550
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:33,000
 After we're hurt, we learn to cherish  ♫

551
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,400
♫  Dear Myself  ♫

552
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,600
♫  Use all your strength  ♫

553
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:43,600
♫  Missing the simple you from the past  ♫

554
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,800
♫  Turn difficulties into courage  ♫

555
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:50,800
♫  Don't back down from the crowd  ♫

556
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:53,000
♫  Growth is inevitably accompanied by setbacks  ♫

557
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
♫  The best way to overcome difficulties is to smile  ♫

558
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,200
♫  All the punishment given by fate, are you afraid?  ♫

559
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,300
♫  Let everything go, all those concerns, real or fake  ♫

560
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:03,600
♫  Cannot erase the scar, but it's just a scar  ♫

561
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:05,100
♫  We are so small yet so determined  ♫

562
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:06,600
♫  Occasionally fussy and occasionally firm  ♫

563
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:09,000
♫  If growth leaves a trace, then the trace is left be tears  ♫

564
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,000
♫  Your back that I've always been chasing  ♫

565
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,100
♫  Finally turned around to hug me tightly  ♫

566
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:18,800
♫  It's still that familiar you  ♫

567
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,000
♫  Yeah...  ♫

568
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,100
♫  Oh...  ♫

569
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:31,600
♫  Dear Myself  ♫

570
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:35,000
♫  Listen to the voice inside  ♫

571
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,000
♫  I'll give you the warmth that the wind took  ♫

572
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,400
♫  Hugging you, hugging me  ♫

573
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,500
♫   Dear Myself  ♫

574
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:48,800
♫  The sky has finally cleared  ♫

575
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:52,000
♫  We've never been so clear-headed  ♫

576
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
♫  Looking for the past me who  ♫

577
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,600
♫  Looking for the past me who  ♫

578
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:01,000
♫  Looking for the past me who  ♫

579
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,400
♫  Listen to the voice inside  ♫

580
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:08,300
♫  The sky has finally cleared  ♫
