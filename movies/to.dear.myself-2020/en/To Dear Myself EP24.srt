2
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,319
Ninety percent are rumors

3
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,920
Ten percent is true

4
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:03,879
That ten percent

5
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:05,480
It's not what they wrote

6
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,479
Mr. Pan, I suggest looking for a lawyer

7
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,840
Prosecute these rumors

8
00:02:09,878 --> 00:02:11,159
Then hold a press conference

9
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:11,960
To clarify the facts

10
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,599
You still have trouble

11
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,800
Is it not big enough?

12
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,759
Li Siyu

13
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:26,000
You must right away

14
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,560
at all costs

15
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,080
Take the impact of this matter

16
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,080
drop to lowest

17
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,080
where are you

18
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:44,479
I need you

19
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,159
Waiting for you in the old place

20
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,120
President Wang

21
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,639
Mr. Pan’s secretary just now

22
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:53,680
Call and say

23
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,639
About financing

24
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:55,599
Can talk more

25
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,280
Tell him

26
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,680
I'm not free this week

27
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,759
I have something at home

28
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,159
Make an appointment next week

29
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,280
Ok

30
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,399
You all know

31
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:45,439
The whole network has been spread

32
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,279
You know so multimedia

33
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:50,040
Can someone please

34
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,279
Help us control the impact

35
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,319
That's too late

36
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,639
From your related news

37
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:56,319
Exposed till now

38
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:57,560
Twelve hours have passed

39
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,360
The entire incident spread

40
00:04:59,360 --> 00:04:59,920
Already missed

41
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,800
Best disposal period

42
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,839
Is there no way?

43
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:05,519
Before you come

44
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:06,399
I have been on the whole incident

45
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:07,279
Made an assessment

46
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:09,720
The main target of public opinion now

47
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,319
Aimed at the shady of investment

48
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,040
On the contrary, the quality of Lubao products

49
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,879
Rarely questioned

50
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:15,040
In fact, at this point

51
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,800
Lucky

52
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:17,439
But the brand image is damaged

53
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,199
Damage to the interests of

54
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:19,040
This is a foregone conclusion

55
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,519
So you guys now

56
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:21,680
The only thing you can do

57
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,040
Is to keep public opinion from escalating

58
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,800
Don't expand

59
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:27,199
Then let the investors lose

60
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:27,920
drop to lowest

61
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,720
That's why i'm looking for you

62
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,560
Be sure to let partners

63
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,439
Have confidence in us

64
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,279
Take me for many years

65
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:36,240
In terms of planning experience

66
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:37,040
the first

67
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:38,680
You can't avoid

68
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:40,279
Can't hide

69
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,800
You must act now

70
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:44,519
Second, you should

71
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:45,920
Proactively contact new media

72
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,879
Including traditional media

73
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:49,040
Based on the principle of sincere communication

74
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:50,759
Admit the mistake to the public

75
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:51,560
Take responsibility

76
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:53,680
and

77
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,839
Deal with relevant responsible persons immediately

78
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,839
That's not my problem at all

79
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:02,079
Why should I admit my mistake

80
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,519
At least you didn't avoid it, right

81
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,319
I remember you told me

82
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:17,279
You said you must bid

83
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:18,680
Not only for yourself

84
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,920
More for the green treasure

85
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,439
Now emerald

86
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:23,439
I need you to bear the burden

87
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:25,839
To take all the responsibilities

88
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:35,279
How to bear

89
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:38,240
Resign

90
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:50,639
I understand

91
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:52,959
Siyu

92
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:54,279
There is another thing

93
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,759
Now the whole thing

94
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:58,040
I don't think it has a hot spot effect

95
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:00,000
But fermented into the way it is now

96
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:00,959
I think

97
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:02,759
It does not conform to the law of transmission

98
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:04,959
What do you mean

99
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,920
Someone hired a navy behind

100
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,319
Who hired

101
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,000
If you need

102
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,600
I can check it for you

103
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:13,800
it is good

104
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,480
Mr. Pan

105
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,519
Go online

106
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:29,839
Leave those comments and comments

107
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,399
This matter really can't be delayed

108
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,839
Don't deal with Li Siyu again

109
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:34,720
This netizen is going to fry the pan

110
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:39,199
Let the employees take the blame when something goes wrong

111
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,199
Irresponsible

112
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:42,720
And there is no company in charge

113
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:44,959
Why do employees trust you

114
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,319
Why do employees work hard for you

115
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,600
Dedicated to you

116
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:50,480
Someone has to be responsible

117
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,439
I am responsible

118
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,639
That will never work

119
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,439
You are the chairman and general manager

120
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:56,279
Instead of letting you take responsibility

121
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:57,240
Why not come here

122
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,279
this matter

123
00:07:58,279 --> 00:07:58,920
From beginning to end

124
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,360
It has nothing to do with you

125
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,600
But Green Treasure has something to do with me

126
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:05,120
I'll take care of this

127
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,279
But Li Siyu as a party

128
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,199
Don't deal with it at all

129
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,399
Definitely not justified

130
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,879
Can't take Li Siyu

131
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,839
I can handle this alone

132
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,000
I consulted an expert

133
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:24,759
He thinks we must

134
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:26,040
Hold a press conference

135
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,439
Admit the mistake to the public

136
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:28,279
Take responsibility

137
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,319
and

138
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,240
And for

139
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,720
Calm public sentiment

140
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:35,279
Calm things down

141
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:37,959
I should take the blame and resign

142
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,919
I'm going to write a resignation report

143
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:42,639
and many more

144
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,440
Fang Zhan, right away

145
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,799
To prepare for the press conference

146
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,799
I personally apologize to the public

147
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,200
And announced

148
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:05,360
Li Siyu

149
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:06,360
Temporary suspension

150
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,200
Can the public accept it?

151
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,480
That's it, let's go

152
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:19,279
As a public enterprise

153
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:20,879
To the resulting

154
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:22,639
Bad public opinion influence

155
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:23,639
We sincerely

156
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:25,159
Apologize to the public

157
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:27,000
As the chairman of the company

158
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,159
I feel so guilty

159
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:29,399
Feel guilty

160
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,080
Related employees currently involved

161
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,399
Has been suspended immediately

162
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,600
Under investigation

163
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,559
I once again to the public

164
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:37,720
Regulatory authorities

165
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,840
Lvbao's shareholders

166
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,600
And all the friends who care about us

167
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,240
Apologize

168
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:43,679
Sincerely welcome the public and media

169
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:46,200
Continue to supervise Emerald

170
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,159
ended

171
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:07,360
OK OK

172
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,360
All right

173
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:12,159
Nothing

174
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,039
It's okay, I'm here

175
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,159
OK OK

176
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:34,080
Let's go

177
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:35,960
go

178
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,679
Mr. Pan said

179
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,120
Just let me rest for a while

180
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:37,399
I'll go back when the storm is over

181
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:41,759
Let's not talk about this

182
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:43,799
Take a good rest first

183
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:45,759
Do not

184
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,639
I have struggled for so many years

185
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,960
I give so much

186
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:52,000
I will never give up easily

187
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:54,840
But even if you don't give up

188
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:56,840
Can't go back

189
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:00,360
why

190
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,679
Think about it

191
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:06,879
Emerald now announces that you have been suspended

192
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:07,799
Waiting to be processed

193
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:09,840
As a result, wait for the storm to pass

194
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:11,320
You will be reinstated immediately

195
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,600
What will the public think

196
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:13,720
They will feel

197
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,759
Emerald is sheltering

198
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,039
Is perfunctory

199
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,120
The public can tolerate mistakes

200
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:21,519
But deception must not be tolerated

201
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:24,159
Maybe then

202
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:25,240
Will trigger new public opinion

203
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,679
public

204
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,720
The public will soon

205
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,080
Forget about it

206
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,799
They don't even care

207
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:33,879
Who is back

208
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:35,279
Emerald's Sales Director

209
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:37,960
I am not so optimistic

210
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:47,519
This is the result you most hope for

211
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,240
I knew it

212
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,480
Why are you

213
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,559
Always look at me like that

214
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:00,159
Is not it

215
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:02,919
Yes

216
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,480
I hope you resign

217
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:09,000
But this is protecting you now

218
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,399
The best way to protect Emerald

219
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,519
And you take advantage of this time

220
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:13,360
have a good rest

221
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,120
Condition your body

222
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,480
What's the problem with this?

223
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,000
That's what I think

224
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,000
What's wrong

225
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,200
Siyu

226
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,600
Now that it has happened

227
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,159
Then we will actively

228
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:51,000
Face it

229
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,159
We take bad things

230
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:54,639
Turned into a good thing

231
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:25,879
Right here

232
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,559
Siyu, what's the situation now?

233
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,600
He was removed from the company

234
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:19,399
what

235
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,799
Zhizhi, sorry

236
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,720
Can it be remedied now?

237
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,159
Is there any other way

238
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:33,240
Can help him

239
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,600
do not worry

240
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,440
I caused this

241
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,879
I will take care of it

242
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,360
Zhizhi

243
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,879
Do you still divorce him

244
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:51,759
want

245
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:02,039
mom

246
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:03,120
father

247
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:03,799
Mom, Yuwei

248
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,759
Are you happy today?

249
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:08,600
Happy

250
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,519
Happy, let's go home

251
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,639
President Wang

252
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,799
It's not easy to see you

253
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:21,639
No

254
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,799
Something happened at home

255
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,960
I thought it would be done in two or three days

256
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,399
It was delayed for a week

257
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,000
OK

258
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,759
Last time I quoted Mr. Wang

259
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:34,759
How are you thinking

260
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:38,279
I also quoted last time

261
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,720
How is Mr. Pan thinking?

262
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,120
Your offer

263
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,720
Not sincere

264
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,720
President Pan The latest change

265
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:49,480
Valuation of Lvbao Company

266
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,720
That little storm

267
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,440
No impact on Emerald

268
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:54,200
This is the latest sale

269
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,759
Completion with purchase order

270
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,080
From the data point of view

271
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,759
Whether it is a distributor or a user

272
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:00,200
I'm very supportive of Emerald

273
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,879
According to our latest estimates

274
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,399
Emerald's valuation

275
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:04,519
In this storm

276
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,640
Severely damaged

277
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,200
Your algorithm is outdated

278
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,759
we believe

279
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:10,160
In the next three months

280
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,118
Will fade

281
00:17:11,118 --> 00:17:12,439
The impact of this storm

282
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,599
We will reshape the Emerald brand

283
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:15,759
this is us

284
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:16,880
Rebranding plan

285
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:19,799
Lvbao Phase III R&D investment is too large

286
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,480
Lead to short-term unprofitable

287
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,400
This fact

288
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,799
Maybe in the short term

289
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:24,358
No circumvention

290
00:17:24,358 --> 00:17:25,118
But Emerald Three

291
00:17:25,118 --> 00:17:26,159
Market growth rate

292
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:26,839
Is very high

293
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:27,519
And how it works

294
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:28,359
Already mature

295
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,240
Consider from a long-term perspective

296
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:32,160
The return on investment is very high

297
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,440
Our

298
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,440
Return on investment

299
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:35,680
Also has a valuation

300
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:36,319
enough

301
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:38,799
Are you thirsty?

302
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:42,960
President Wang

303
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:46,839
Eight hundred million twenty-two percent

304
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,200
Twenty-four percent

305
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:53,119
You are taking advantage of the fire

306
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:57,000
800 million

307
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,079
Twenty-two percent

308
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,359
Mr. Pan

309
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,599
Twenty-four percent

310
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,000
Farewell

311
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:52,039
President Wang

312
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,960
Twenty-two percent

313
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,039
I think we can accept

314
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:57,759
I must get it

315
00:18:57,759 --> 00:18:58,880
Twenty-three percent

316
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,119
Just one point

317
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:02,160
Or we chase them back

318
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:02,880
Keep talking

319
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:04,799
The current bribery storm of Emerald III

320
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:05,920
Already subsiding

321
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,039
If this time

322
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,000
Let's drag on

323
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,440
Once a new investor enters the market

324
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:10,680
It's even harder to talk

325
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:48,559
Twenty-three percent

326
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:56,000
President Chen, your appointment letter

327
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,359
Appointment letter

328
00:19:58,119 --> 00:19:58,839
Congratulations

329
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,119
Is Mr. Wang here?

330
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,000
inside

331
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:15,680
it is good

332
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,079
Yiming

333
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:21,000
President Wang

334
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,559
Got notified

335
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:24,519
Correct

336
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,440
This is for me

337
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,680
For newcomers who just joined the company

338
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,559
Yes is it a bit

339
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:31,400
Too fast

340
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:34,079
First of all

341
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:36,000
you deserve this

342
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,119
You create value for the company

343
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:39,200
The company should return you

344
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:41,960
Secondly

345
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,400
I need you for Tianyi Group

346
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,880
Create new strategic assets

347
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:49,000
The third

348
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,119
I also believe that you can help the company

349
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:52,160
Create more value

350
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:56,000
Ok

351
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:16,519
Manager Chen

352
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:17,720
Your dedicated parking space is over there

353
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,839
There is also an underground garage

354
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:19,839
It has your license plate number

355
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,519
thank you

356
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:22,039
Nothing

357
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:38,359
Manager Chen

358
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:40,759
Manager Chen

359
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:41,599
I invested in Donglai

360
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:42,559
Administration Manager

361
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,359
Your new office

362
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:44,279
On the 22nd floor

363
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:45,200
This is your new assistant

364
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:45,920
Mr. Chen, hello

365
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,519
Hello there

00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:49,640
it is good

370
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:03,400
Manager Chen

371
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:04,480
Here please

372
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,480
Mr. Chen, please

373

Chen Zonghao Chen Zonghao

377
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:31,279
Mr. Chen, this is your office

378
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:33,200
President Chen, I'm going out first

379
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,599
What's the matter you feel free to call me

380
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:35,119
it is good

381
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:35,880
I'll put it on the table for you

382
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:37,200
thank you

383
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:37,759
Nothing

384
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:45,319
Tenth year

385
00:24:54,279 --> 00:24:55,519
Chen Yiming

386
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,200
Tianyi Group

387
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,880
Donglai Investment Co., Ltd.

388
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,039
Deputy General Manager

389
00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:06,759
Mr. Wang, please see

390
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,119
I plan to build another park

391
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:10,960
Two first

392
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,240
Emerald III's production line

393
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,559
Five years later

394
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:16,880
If there are ten production lines

395
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:19,480
That half of China's new energy industry

396
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,559
Must be emerald

397
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:23,240
Five years

398
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:24,680
This is the ideal state

399
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:26,400
Maybe ten years

400
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:29,799
Mr. Pan

401
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,319
Don’t you want to

402
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,640
The valuation of Emerald

403
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,680
20 billion?

404
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,319
President Wang

405
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,640
Tell you the truth

406
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,640
If not for this equity financing

407
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:45,160
My valuation

408
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,359
Not interested at all

409
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,279
honestly

410
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,000
in my heart

411
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:51,720
Core technology is the last word

412
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:53,960
As for what valuation

413
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,759
I don't like these virtual

414
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,480
Really

415
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,240
Right lad

416
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:08,640
I'm sorry

417
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,680
I booked a restaurant to gather in the evening

418
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,759
Hello, Xiao Zhao

419
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:42,880
Hey

420
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:44,799
Don't forget the meeting at 3:30

421
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,160
I am Li Siyu

422
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:49,839
Sorry

423
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,720
I forgot that you have been suspended

424
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:10,039
Hello, this is Li Siyu

425
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,039
You are Li Siyu

426
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,400
I finally found you

427
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:14,720
You scum

428
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:16,119
Corruption and bribery

429
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,920
Simply social

430
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:08,680
It's you

431
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,400
You can't get through

432
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:17,319
I forgot to recharge my phone

433
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:30,079
Come in and talk

434
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:38,359
Just say it here

435
00:28:56,119 --> 00:28:57,160
How is Yuwei?

436
00:28:57,359 --> 00:28:58,200
pretty good

437
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:01,920
Is the alimony for the next quarter

438
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:03,319
It's time for me

439
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,480
Can you

440
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:11,400
Two days off

441
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,160
why

442
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,680
I'm busy looking for a house recently

443
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,359
Deposit

444
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:18,559
No more money

445
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:20,839
Yuwei is going to kindergarten

446
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,319
Eat and drink

447
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:23,559
It all needs money

448
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,119
I know

449
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:27,640
I don't want to give

450
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,440
You give me two more days

451
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:31,759
This is your father

452
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:32,799
Due obligation

453
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:36,480
I got a job in two days

454
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,079
I'll call you the money

455
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:40,920
You have been procrastinating for a week

456
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:47,920
I shouldn't

457
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,200
Hold any hope for you

458
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:53,200
Zhizhi Zhizhi

459
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,440
Congratulations on your promotion to vice president

460
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:04,160
You knew already

461
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:08,640
I booked a seat over there

462
00:31:22,279 --> 00:31:23,759
I may not be able to drink

463
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:24,599
I drove over

464
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,200
You can find a driver

465
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,559
Come

466
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:40,480
It surprised me that

467
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,319
Sister Ziru values ​​you so much

468
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,799
I think it can

469
00:31:45,799 --> 00:31:46,759
Put it another way

470
00:31:48,759 --> 00:31:49,319
all these are

471
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:52,240
Got it by my own hard work

472
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:52,880
Right

473
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,039
it is good

474
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,240
I have said

475
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,720
You're the best

476
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:04,519
Now the entire Tianyi Group

477
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,880
No one will say i am

478
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,960
Mixed up by nepotism

479
00:32:16,359 --> 00:32:18,920
Why didn't you tell me earlier

480
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,960
I'm afraid I will be stimulated

481
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,079
Yes

482
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:37,480
I take a call

483
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:40,039
Hey

484
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:42,160
Then you first

485
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,440
Send it to my mailbox first

486
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,240
Let me take a look

487
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:45,680
Correct

488
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,119
Okay. First of all

489
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:48,400
Ah bye

490
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:52,960
Siyu

491
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,160
I am really

492
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,519
I really

493
00:32:56,519 --> 00:32:57,720
Have a lot of ideas

494
00:32:57,799 --> 00:32:59,319
But i don't know

495
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:00,680
Don't know how to tell you

496
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,319
I used to

497
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:06,640
It's Caijin Company

498
00:33:07,079 --> 00:33:08,480
The youngest department director

499
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,240
And i now

500
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,640
Donglai Group

501
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,920
The youngest vice president

502
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:17,680
And in the future

503
00:33:18,519 --> 00:33:19,359
I must be too

504
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:20,880
The youngest vice president of Tianyi Group

505
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:23,319
ten years

506
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,960
I have been fighting for ten years

507
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,680
To be honest i am now

508
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,359
There are many in my heart

509
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:29,839
Feelings and thoughts

510
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:30,359
but

511
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:33,079
I can't think about it

512
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:34,599
I

513
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,160
I am making a set

514
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:39,799
Brand brand strategy

515
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,720
In the entire financial circle

516
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,799
No one has done it yet

517
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:44,799
Whether it is Tianyi Group

518
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:45,400
Or sister Ziru

519
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,400
They all let me do it

520
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,400
Doesn't bind me at all

521
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:57,880
Hey

522
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:01,599

523
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,400
Tomorrow tomorrow

524
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,039
Yes, you come to the company tomorrow

525
00:34:08,039 --> 00:34:08,760
Find me

526
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:11,880
Ten o'clock around ten o'clock

527
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,559
No no no

528
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:15,920
I may not have that long

529
00:34:16,599 --> 00:34:17,440
Fifteen minutes

530
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,199
I happen to have

531
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:19,159
15 minutes of gap

532
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:20,679
We can talk a little bit

533
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,480
it is good

534
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,280
OK, that's it first

535
00:34:25,518 --> 00:34:26,879
Ah, see you tomorrow at the company

536
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,840
okay

537
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,599
Bye bye

538
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,400
Siyu

539
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:40,159
I just said those

540
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,320
Actually I have no other meaning

541
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:43,920
I just want to tell you

542
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:45,599
our future

543
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,760
Will definitely get better and better

544
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,159
I have this ability now

545
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:50,920
To take care of you

546
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,039
Will give you a sense of security

547
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:55,639
Like you said before

548
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:56,760
Talk about raising children

549
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,679
Repay the mortgage

550
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:58,199
You really

551
00:34:58,199 --> 00:34:59,280
Don't worry at all

552
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,719
Those are all mine

553
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:03,239
Just be responsible for being beautiful

554
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:11,440
If I'm not beautiful anymore

555
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:13,280
Does it mean

556
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,880
You won't pay the mortgage

557
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:16,360
No longer raising children

558
00:35:21,639 --> 00:35:22,400
look

559
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:23,800
I knew it

560
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,800
You would say so

561
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:25,960
So I

562
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,000
I have been hesitating

563
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:29,800
Hesitate what to tell you

564
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,039
Hey

565
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:42,159
Yes it's me

00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,119
Then you first interview

00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,800
Send me the outline of the interview

571
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,519

578
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:10,559
Then discuss it carefully

579
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,239
Good good

580
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:15,079
Yes yes

00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,360
Goodbye

582
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:18,119
Ok

583
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,920
These reporters now

584
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,880
The news is really good

585
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:27,199
Caught up so soon

586
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:29,320
Honestly i

587
00:36:29,639 --> 00:36:30,800
I really don't want to be interviewed

588
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,440
but

589
00:36:32,519 --> 00:36:33,079
but now

590
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:33,960
The company needs to promote

591
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:34,920
So I can't help it

592
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,320
You are so busy

593
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,000
Siyu

594
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:44,519
I will get busy

595
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,119
and so

596
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,000
Hey

597
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,519
Brother Qian

598
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,079
So soon you will know

599
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:06,159
That's great, right

600
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:07,400
Then this time we can

601
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,119
Together to do a big thing

602
00:37:11,719 --> 00:37:12,679
I think I will make sure

603
00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:13,960
Its whole values

604
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,480
Yes no problem

605
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,119
I think before me

606
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:17,800
The plan I thought

607
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,639
Absolutely no problem

608
00:37:18,679 --> 00:37:19,840
Then we systematically regulate

609
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:26,880
what

610
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,239
OK, no problem

611
00:37:29,239 --> 00:37:30,159
Then we will meet

612
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:31,760
Let's talk more carefully

613
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:37,480
Good um good um

614
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,559
Bye bye

615
00:37:48,039 --> 00:37:50,000
Hello, the user you are calling

616
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,519
Temporarily unavailable

617
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:52,400
Sorry

618
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,239
Hello, the user you are calling

619
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:08,760
Temporarily unavailable

620
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,639
Sorry

621
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:11,360
The user you dialed

622
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,880
Temporarily unavailable

623
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:34,400
Is that what I said today

624
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,320
Makes you uncomfortable

625
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,559
Xiaoling said you can't get through

626
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:18,719
Worried about you

627
00:40:20,599 --> 00:40:21,559
Two days ago

628
00:40:21,559 --> 00:40:22,800
Don't know who put my phone number

629
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,639
Leak out

630
00:40:24,519 --> 00:40:26,719
The keyboard man always calls and scolds me

631
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,880
I shut down

632
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,599
Do you want to call the police?

633
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:30,679
No need to

634
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:32,599
It's gone for two days

635
00:40:33,079 --> 00:40:34,360
Didn’t you see that I turned it on?

636
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:36,400
That's good

637
00:40:41,159 --> 00:40:42,199
These two days

638
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:44,079
Are you ok

639
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,719
that

640
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,239
Where's Liu Yang

641
00:41:02,119 --> 00:41:03,360
Yuwei's living expenses

642
00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:05,960
He has owed more than a month

643
00:41:06,679 --> 00:41:07,840
I go find him

644
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,440
He told me no

645
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,960
He is not working now

646
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:20,800
Want to rent again

647
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,039
Maybe not

648
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,320
I do not know either

649
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,840
Is he true or not?

650
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,239
But if

651
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:35,079
If I have your confidence

652
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,039
I will tell him

653
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,280
I don't want your money

654
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,079
But i can't tell

655
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:48,960
Zhizhi

656
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:50,480
How much do you want

657
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:51,559
Is five thousand enough?

658
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,639
Siyu sister

659
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,079
I can't ask for your money

660
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,880
I still have savings

661
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:00,280
Zhizhi, I am responsible for this

662
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:02,000
You let me do something

663
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:03,039
Siyu sister

664
00:42:03,639 --> 00:42:04,360
About Liu Yang

665
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,960
Has nothing to do with you

666
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:21,920
You now

667
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,679
How did you plan

668
00:42:26,719 --> 00:42:28,000
Wait for him to stabilize

669
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,039
Just go through the formalities

670
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:34,119
Haven't you prepared before

671
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:35,400
Did you give him a step?

672
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:37,639
Why suddenly became so determined

673
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,079
I went to him that day

674
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,280
I have found

675
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:44,159
He has told Wei Yayun

676
00:42:44,159 --> 00:42:45,079
Live together

677
00:42:54,719 --> 00:42:56,400
Are they still together now?

678
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:58,760
do not know

679
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:01,320
I don't want to know

680
00:43:09,239 --> 00:43:10,159
How are you

681
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:13,920
Take a break

682
00:43:16,119 --> 00:43:17,400
What are your plans

683
00:43:18,239 --> 00:43:19,239
Mr. Pan said

684
00:43:20,119 --> 00:43:22,719
Wait for this storm to subside

685
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:23,760
Just let me go back

686
00:43:29,079 --> 00:43:30,320
I heard a saying

687
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:33,159
about what

688
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:36,159
President Fang

689
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:38,920
I want to invite Yuan Huizhong back

690
00:43:41,159 --> 00:43:42,360
Back to sales department

691
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,199
Be a director

692
00:43:44,679 --> 00:43:46,800
Mommy mommy

693
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,360
Yuwei, come

694
00:43:52,039 --> 00:43:53,320
Are you happy today?

695
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,199
Happy

696
00:43:54,199 --> 00:43:54,760
happy

697
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:55,800
What did you learn today

698
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,960
Hello, Mr. Liu

00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:06,360
Your resume

00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:07,599
We have all seen it

701
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:08,840
What else do you have about entry

702
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:09,880
No new requirements

703
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,719
I just want to be able to join the job as soon as

704
00:44:13,039 --> 00:44:14,280
Then report next Monday

705
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:15,920

707
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:32,159
