[To Dear Myself]

3
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,500
[Episode 27]

4
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,100
Is Yuwei asleep?

5
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,400
I still can't believe

6
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,000
that you really broke up with Brother Yiming.

7
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,800
Yeah. How did you suddenly get this point?

8
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,500
Sister Siyu,

9
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,600
could it be that you are being too eager to excel?

10
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,600
Yeah. Can't you just take a step back?

11
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,200
First get married, then start a business. The order is not a big deal.

12
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,100
It's not about what comes first and what comes last.

13
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:06,400
It's what he wants and what I want most

14
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,200
are different.

15
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,600
Can you not compromise?

16
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,300
I've been compromising up until today. I'm tired.

17
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,800
Is there still a possibility that you'll get back together?

18
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,600
No.

19
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,800
If you want to cry, just cry.

20
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,600
I don't have time to cry.

21
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,410
There's still so much work waiting for me to do.

22
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,200
Fortunately, I still have work.

23
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,540
If you guys are really breaking up,

24
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,970
then you need to figure out the debts between you two.

25
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,400
What debt?

26
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,200
What's going to happen to the house they bought together? How about the mortgage?

27
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,830
You go talk to him.

28
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:20,000
I don't have time.

29
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,910
This idea is quite good.

30
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,200
You can take care of each other.

31
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,100
You can live at my house to save money.

32
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:04,110
But let me tell you clearly.

33
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,600
If I have an important date, then you have to go stay at a hotel.

34
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,900
Also, you can't force me to

35
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:16,000
memorize words, write essays, and do my homework every day like when we were younger.

36
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Also, you can't call me a coquettish girl every time I dress up.

37
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,200
More importantly, you can't report everything I do to my mom.

38
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,400
I won't.

39
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,900
Zhizhi, what do you plan to do?

40
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,630
Divorce.

41
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,700
I heard something happened to Liu Yang.

42
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,800
That girl betrayed Liu Yang.

43
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,900
Liu Yang really ended things with her this time.

44
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:04,810
So what?

45
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:07,000
Once you find out

46
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,800
about some things

47
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,100
you can't pretend to be oblivious.

48
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,600
What things?

49
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,040
Liu Yang is very stiff, awkward,

50
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,200
and a dumb man.

51
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,100
He doesn't know how to be romantic

52
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,800
and doesn't know how to take care of people.

53
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,800
But when I saw him together with Wei Yayun, I realized

54
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,100
that he does know how to be romantic

55
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,900
and does know how to take care of people.

56
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,700
It just depends on who he's with.

57
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,690
During these five years of marriage,

58
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,820
our lives have been quite hard;

59
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,300
however, I was willing to go through the hardships

60
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,200
because he loved me

61
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,600
and I loved him.

62
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:18,420
I was willing to giving everything up for him.

63
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,600
But in reality,

64
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:26,220
I was just lying to myself.

65
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,600
He didn't love me.

66
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,200
He didn't see me as a lover or a wife.

67
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,200
During this whole time,

68
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,700
he just saw me as a nanny.

69
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,000
But even now,

70
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
you still go to the hospital to take care of him every day.

71
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,300
Even though I am completely disappointed in him,

72
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,600
he's still Yuwei's dad.

73
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,700
Zhizhi, you're too kind.

74
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,600
In a marriage,

75
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,600
kindness can't be exchanged for sincerity.

76
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,600
Even if you do get sincerity,

77
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:28,200
it will be destroyed by the pressures of life.

78
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,200
Enough. You two stop talking.

79
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,800
If you keep saying things like this,

80
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,400
all of us will become dissatisfied housewives.

81
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:44,500
Isn't it merely five years of your youth wasted for a bastard?

82
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,400
It's fine.

83
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:51,000
In the next five years, we can live happily to make up for the past five years.

84
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And you! Isn't it just a mere break up?

85
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,900
It hasn't even been half a year and I've already broken up twice!

86
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:00,200
Look!  Have I been depressed or sad?

87
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,500
You win in the end only if you fight on despite repeated setbacks.

88
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,800
Let's empty this bottle of wine.

89
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,500
Pour it.

90
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,100
Okay. Mine.

91
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,400
I'm announcing that we are going to

92
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,600
leave all of our sorrows, problems, and anger

93
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,000
in the present.

94
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,400
Tomorrow is a new day!

95
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,200
- Cheers! 
 - Cheers.

96
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,390
Is she okay?

97
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,790
She's really well.

98
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,500
How is her business venture going?

99
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,600
You're not even supporting her, so just don't ask.

100
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,900
She hopes... that you will sell the house

101
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,300
and return her the down payment she payed.

102
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,710
If we sell the house then we can't buy it back.

103
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:08,800
So how about we don't sell it?

104
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,400
She really needs money right now though.

105
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,460
I'll figure something out.

106
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,800
I asked the agent and he said that that house has appreciated in value.

107
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,700
If you sell it, you have to return at least ¥800,000 to her.

108
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,800
Xiaoling,

109
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,200
that house has only appreciated ¥300,000 in total.

110
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,600
I know.

111
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:39,200
Also, Siyu paid ¥500,000 in total at that time.

112
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,600
She's been with you for 5 years.

113
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,400
Shouldn't you compensate her?

114
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,900
But I don't have that much money to give her right now.

115
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,170
Then write an IOU.

116
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:59,930
I... asked for an additional ¥300,000 for you.

117
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,200
Who told you to do that?

118
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,000
I was helping you to fight for your rights and interests.

119
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,200
How is that fighting for my rights and interests?

120
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,200
This is blackmailing.

121
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,800
How is that blackmailing?

122
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,000
It's very clearly written on the house deed

123
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,800
that each of you owns half of the house.

124
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,000
Asking for ¥800,000 is not too much at all.

125
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,900
Besides, we need to get some kind of compensation for your youth!

126
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,010
If I knew you had those thoughts,

127
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:28,000
then I wouldn't have let you go!

128
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
From now on, I won't meddle into your business.

129
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:22,660
Let's change the house deed tomorrow.

130
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,630
I don't have ¥800,000 to give you right now.

131
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:13,110
We can talk about it after we do the paperwork.

132
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,850
Okay.

133
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,540
I was clearly helping her,

134
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,320
yet she lectured me.

135
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,110
Have you ever met such an ungrateful person before?

136
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,180
Of course, I have.

137
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:42,290
Last time, in front of the art museum,

138
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:45,220
I helped a woman get out of the grasp of an asshole,

139
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,210
but she also scolded me.

140
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:49,200
Who are you talking about?

141
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:53,420
I'm saying that the two of you are pretty much the same, you can't really judge each other.

142
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,500
Then again,

143
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,180
Chen Yiming is my bro.

144
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,850
You asked for ¥300,000 for no reason. That's a bit harsh.

145
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:07,530
How is it for no reason?

146
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:11,170
He hurt Siyu and I helped her get compensation. What's wrong with that?

147
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:13,490
Wasn't Chen Yiming also hurt?

148
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:15,920
I saw him yesterday.

149
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,950
He lost a ton of weight.

150
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:20,780
He deserves it.

151
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,570
If you want my opinion, this really isn't Yiming's fault.

152
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:28,150
Then are you blaming Li Siyu?

153
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:31,020
- Li Siyu did act a little too crazy. 
 - Who's crazy?!

154
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,350
You were just saying how she was ungrateful!

155
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,320
I can insult her, but you can't!

156
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:39,060
Fine, fine, fine.

157
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,860
Do you think the two of them will be able to make up?

158
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:55,090
Li Siyu is going to have to change for that to happen.

159
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:57,640
Otherwise, it will be like last time.

160
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,840
They'll get back together and split again.

161
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:04,520
Then do you think that Chen Yiming doesn't have to change?

162
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,410
That's true.

163
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:09,650
Compared to me, Chen Yiming indeed is

164
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:12,040
not as warm, handsome, or interesting;

165
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:16,050
but overall, he's considered perfect.

166
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,920
Eat a kebob, eat a kebob.

167
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,670
I can't eat spicy things for a month.

168
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:25,260
How come?

169
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:28,440
I had an injection, and the doctor says I need to avoid certain foods.

170
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,630
No way! You look like this yet you went to get injections?

171
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:35,710
Even though I'm beautiful,  I will eventually get old.

172
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:38,420
Why are you afraid to be old?

173
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:41,530
Isn't there a good song about it?

174
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:48,150
♪ How many people can love your appearance when you were young? ♪

175
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:53,750
♪ But who will not care about the cruel changes that come with time? ♪

176
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:59,360
♪ How many people can come and go from your life? ♪

177
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:05,260
♪ Know I'll be by your side in this lifetime ♪

178
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,930
Are you touched?

179
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:09,660
Why not?

180
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,490
If I got old, and you were the only one by my side,

181
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,520
then I would be such a failure.

182
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,230
Then having whom by your side makes you feel like you aren't a failure?

183
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,750
He at least has to be a silver-haired

184
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,960
and charming retired billionaire.

185
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,220
Aren't you just describing me in fifty years?

186
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,200
You?

187
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:32,990
What are you laughing at? Are you looking down on me?

188
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:36,740
You should do something that makes me not look down on you then!

189
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,680
Deal.

190
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:03,270
Now the house only belongs to you.

191
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,150
I will transfer ¥500,000 to you first.

192
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:09,810
The remaining ¥300,000...

193
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:12,740
I will repay it all within two years.

194
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:17,240
This is my IOU letter.

195
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,910
[Proof of Debt] 

196
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,090
You don't owe me anything.

197
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,310
Siyu!

198
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,850
In regards to our future, I have had

199
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,650
many, many thoughts

200
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:13,650
but I never thought

201
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:17,520
this would be the ending.

202
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,660
It was my fault.

203
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:25,020
I couldn't give you what you wanted.

204
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,670
No, you aren't wrong. The things you want aren't wrong either.

205
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:29,640
It's just that I—

206
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,050
It's just...

207
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:37,800
we may be on paths that go in different directions.

208
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:43,050
No matter what,

209
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:47,070
I sincerely love you.

210
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,390
I sincerely love you as well.

246
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,400
Hello?

247
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,000
Hello? Yiming?

248
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:46,100
Mom, could you please lend me some more money?

249
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:49,400
I looked at the material for number 18.

250
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,400
He's pretty good in all areas, but I think

251
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,000
he's a little bit too old.

252
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,400
I'd prefer the age to not be over 40.

253
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:02,900
Okay, then I'll wait for your news.

254
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,800
Who were you calling?

255
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,600
My personal matchmaker.

256
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,200
What?

257
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,400
I went on a dating website and registered a VIP account.

258
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,000
Exclusive one-on-one sessions with matchmakers.

259
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,400
Spending tens of thousands of yuan really gets you something different.

260
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,400
The men she's introduced to me are all either rich or have high social status.

261
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,000
I think you can try it, too.

262
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,200
No time, no money, no interest.

263
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,000
I'm serious.

264
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,590
Even if you can't find someone to be with for the rest of your life,

265
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:35,400
you can find someone who will help start your business.

266
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,700
Right? Right?

267
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,600
What's wrong?

268
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,100
Chen Yiming transferred ¥800,000 to you?

269
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,700
I guess he does have a conscience after all.

270
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,800
Do you have liquor?

271
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,400
Do you want to die? Do you not want your stomach?

272
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,000
I will look for it for you.

273
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,900
[Available Balance: ¥316.99]

274
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,600
[Available Balance: ¥118.00]

275
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:16,300
[Available Balance: RBM 0.00]

276
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:22,700
If you don't need any other service, please take out your card.

277
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,190
Yuwei,

278
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:54,800
Mom wants to talk to you about something.

279
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:01,400
We won't buy new shoes for now. Wear the old ones for now.

280
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,000
But the teacher said

281
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,600
that my dance shoes are already battered,

282
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,100
and need new ones.

283
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,700
I will help you patch them up.

284
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:17,200
The other kids are all wearing new dance shoes.

285
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,600
If I patch up your old ones, you'll still be able to dance.

286
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:26,100
I want new dance shoes, too.

287
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,800
I don't have enough money right now.

288
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:39,200
Didn't you just take money from the bank?

289
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,600
This is for your dad's hospital fee,

290
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,400
and it's also for your preschool fees,

291
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,000
and our electricity bill,

292
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,600
water bill, gas bill, and phone bill.

293
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,500
Doesn't Daddy get money every month?

294
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:58,400
Daddy is in the hospital right now. He has no money.

295
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,400
Then is your money enough?

296
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:10,110
You don't have to worry about that.

297
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,600
Mommy, I have money.

298
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,600
What money do you have?

299
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:22,000
Today, I was the first to finish eating and doing classwork.

300
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,600
The teacher awarded us this to use at the fairytale hut

301
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,300
to buy crayons and ribbons.

302
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,200
These little coupons can't buy dance shoes.

303
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,600
I don't want dance shoes anymore.

304
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,200
Mommy, you can have this money to spend.

305
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,220
In the future,

306
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:51,600
Mommy will buy you lots and lots of new dance shoes.

307
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,600
What do you mean?

308
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,400
I've really never met someone like you before.

309
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,300
You are basically asking me to pay for your renovations.

310
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,600
¥26.5.

311
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,800
Ms. Li, you're a boss now.

312
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:27,400
Negotiating the price by ¥0.5 or ¥1... is there a point?

313
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,200
Brother, I also know that it doesn't really make a difference.

314
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,200
I also want to be able to magnanimously be able to wave my hand and say "Sure, let's do that,"

315
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,600
but my budget doesn't allow me to do that.

316
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,400
Not just ¥0.5 or ¥1.

317
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,400
Right now, I really want to split ¥0.01 in half to spend.

318
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,600
Well, we also need to earn money and eat.

319
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,600
Nowadays, a bento that looks just a little bit decent is already ¥15.

320
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,100
For lunch, I had a bento that only cost ¥8 each.

321
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:51,600
Ms. Li, how much money can you pay?

322
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,000
My construction budget is only  ¥300,000.

323
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Not a single construction company in Shanghai would accept this job for that budget.

324
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
The lowest I can go... ¥580,000.

325
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,900
¥302,000.

326
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,800
If I had known earlier, I wouldn't have even come.

327
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,300
Aren't you just wasting my time?

328
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,100
President Wang.

329
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,100
How come you've been staying up late so often recently?

330
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:00,390
No, I haven't.

331
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,500
How are you and Siyu?

332
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,700
We broke up.

333
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,600
How about I invite her out, and you two can talk some more?

334
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:34,500
There's no need. It's fine the way things are right now.

335
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,040
We are both free now

336
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,000
and relieved now.

337
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:45,400
You don't look relieved at all.

338
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,400
Perhaps, I-I-

339
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,800
I'm not used to- used to being relieved.

340
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,800
This is my stop, President Wang.

341
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,200
Yiming!

342
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:11,000
If you really want to be free, then you must let it go completely.

343
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,900
If you want someone to talk to, I'm always here.

344
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,600
Thank you, Sister Ziru.

345
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,300
I'm leaving now.

346
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,800
This here, we can finish this today.

347
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,300
- How about over here? 
 - Don't worry.

348
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:49,100
We can definitely finish by the end of this month.

349
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,800
Please make way.

350
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,400
Boss Li.

351
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,000
Here!

352
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,100
Sister Siyu.

353
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,600
Zhizhi?

354
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,200
Over there.

355
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,980
If we talk here, it's quieter and cleaner.

356
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,200
How come you're dressed like a construction worker?

357
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,500
I am one right now.

358
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
You're not doing this personally, are you?

359
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Doing it personally saves money.

360
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,200
Then what is the construction company for?

361
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:33,200
The construction company wouldn't make any money with my budget so they rejected it.

362
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,600
I found my own workers to do it.

363
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,400
Will it work out?

364
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,500
I don't have money so I have to make it work.

365
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,400
Why were you looking for me?

366
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:49,600
Nothing, I just wanted to see if you needed any help.

367
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:55,300
I'm still short ¥1 million here.

368
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,500
How about you make it up for me?

369
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:01,300
I'm joking.

370
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:06,500
- Miss Li, give me a hand! 
 - Coming!

371
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,600
- Go work. 
 - Then I'll leave you here.

372
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,700
Be safe!

373
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:46,790
GM Pan, is there something you need to discuss with me?

374
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:51,480
Nothing. I was reorganizing my cabinet just now,

375
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:54,010
and I found something.

376
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:56,450
It made me especially touched.

377
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:14,560
Take a close look. This tie is yours.

378
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:18,040
- Mine? 
 - Did you forget?

379
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:23,570
At that time, Lubao was just founded. I was going to visit a senior.

380
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:27,910
You took this tie off and tied it on me.

381
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:31,460
At the time, you even said

382
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:35,460
"GM Pan, you are Lubao's representative."

383
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:39,740
"I can be a little disheveled, but you must be glamorous."

384
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,750
I think I remember that.

385
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:46,210
After we'd successfully started the business,

386
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,290
I bought a lot of ties,

387
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:54,790
but this one is the only one I kept. I didn't have the heart to exchange it.

388
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:57,980
It reminds me of your contributions to Lubao

389
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:02,760
and our friendship forged by working hard together.

390
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:05,410
That's something that happened over ten years ago.

391
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:09,080
Yes. Over ten years ago.

392
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:13,800
At that time, I worked with the technicians

393
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,320
staying up night after night in the lab.

394
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:21,730
You and the sales team went around all of China.

395
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:24,570
That's how we have this business today.

396
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:27,760
I remember I had to go on a business trip to Zhengzhou.

397
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,460
Before leaving, your hair was all black.

398
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:34,820
I was gone for less than a month, but when I came back, all of your hair turned white!

399
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:39,680
I also remembered that out of the 365 days in the year,

400
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,720
you were on business trips for 300 days.

401
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,420
The other sixty days,

402
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:49,060
you were mostly working overtime.

403
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:51,100
Because of this,

404
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:54,800
your ex-wife divorced you, right?

405
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:59,580
We gave up too much for Lubao.

406
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:03,700
Yes. We've both gave up too much for Lubao,

407
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,960
but the friendship between the two of us

408
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,680
can never be replaced by anyone.

409
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:11,410
You're right.

410
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,930
Sit.

411
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:24,920
We've been very busy these past two years.

412
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:27,160
We've interacted a lot less than before.

413
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,250
The company is getting bigger and bigger.

414
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:33,320
The market changed, and we started to disagree with each other.

415
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:36,690
Fang Zhan, it's okay.

416
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,930
Here,

417
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:42,380
in my heart,

418
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:45,720
you have always been my best brother,

419
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:48,740
companion, and partner.

420
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:52,320
Yes.

421
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:56,660
It was so hard in the past, yet we got through it.

422
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:58,980
In the future, it might be even harder,

423
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:02,180
but let us get through it together. Okay?

424
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,730
GM Pan, to tell you the truth,

425
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,740
I'm a little tired.

426
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:15,500
Why?

427
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:21,590
Nowadays, doing business is so hard.

428
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:24,600
We can invest hundreds of millions, but in a year,

429
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,590
we can only earn a few million.

430
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:28,470
Something that might be hard to hear,

431
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:31,120
buying a house would appreciate faster than this.

432
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:42,140
Fang Zhan, Fang Zhan.

433
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:46,880
When we invested in this industry back then, were we just looking to make money?

434
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:51,190
If it was to make money, then I would've sold my patent back then.

435
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:56,010
If it was to make money, then you could've invested in any other field.

436
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:59,060
Weren't we doing this to fulfill our dream?

437
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:03,640
Do you remember our old motto?

438
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:07,980
"The most outstanding in the industry. No.1 in China. The leader of the world. "

439
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:10,120
"The most outstanding in the industry"? We did it!

440
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,900
We are just one step away from being the "No. 1 in China."

441
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:15,760
Are you really going to leave now?

442
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:19,630
- I just— 
 - I know, Fang Zhan.

443
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:21,690
I know.

444
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:24,030
In the past two years, you've worked especially hard.

445
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:28,140
I am also impatient, so you've suffered a lot because of me.

446
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:30,870
Fang Zhan, I promise you

447
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:33,530
that from now on, I will be more aware

448
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:35,850
of my work attitude and ways.

449
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,580
GM Pan,

450
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:42,490
honestly, you've been fine.

451
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:50,400
Lubao being where it's at today

452
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,990
was very difficult.

453
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:55,720
We must not give up.

454
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,710
Let's continue, okay?

455
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:09,110
In the next few days, I plan to invite the Board of Directors to a meeting

456
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:11,040
to discuss Lubao3 again.

457
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,720
I will propose to install another 2 production lines.

458
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,430
I hope that you will support me.

459
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:19,680
Just like before.

460
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:25,280
How is Liu Yang?

461
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,550
There are a few health indices that haven't dropped to a normal level yet.

462
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:30,170
The doctors say that he needs to stay in the hospital for a while longer.

463
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:32,280
I asked around, and people with this sickness

464
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:35,630
cannot get overstimulated or tired. They have to recover slowly.

465
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:37,740
How are you doing?

466
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:42,530
Hi, Xiao Liu, long time no see.

467
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:46,560
Your aunt just got paid. Yuwei, you can order whatever you want to eat.

468
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,630
Aunt, do you have a lot of money?

469
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:51,640
I want to have a lot of money.

470
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:54,630
Will you share some with mommy?

471
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:56,940
Yuwei, what are you saying?

472
00:41:56,940 --> 00:42:00,590
When we were eating fruit, the teacher said

473
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:05,180
that the kids who cannot finish their fruits can share with the kids who don't have any.

474
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:07,270
These are not the same things.

475
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:10,770
- Don't you not have money? 
 - Yuwei!

476
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:14,370
You are not allowed to talk about it again.

477
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:16,560
I'll give you another jujube.

478
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:25,490
[¥2,000] 

479
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:31,230
Let's take a look.

480
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:46,260
- Xiaoling.
 -  I've known you since I was 12 years old.

481
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:53,020
- Thank you. 
 - Why thank me? It's nothing.

482
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:57,260
I'll just buy one less outfit. Later, I'll have Siyu give you some.

483
00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:00,110
Don't. Please don't tell her about this.

484
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:01,780
What?

485
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:05,810
Haven't you notice that she's worried about money?

486
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:08,480
Doesn't she have a lot of money?

487
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:13,210
A few days ago, I went to see her.

488
00:43:13,810 --> 00:43:17,250
No wonder she takes my hand moisturizer.

489
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:21,950
Join my team! Trust me. Within three years, we will definitely be the leading brand

490
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:24,920
within the car battery service industry.

491
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:30,460
That's great! We'll meet at the company next Monday then!

492
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:40,110
Great, I just recruited a talent.

493
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:43,060
What were we talking about earlier?

494
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:45,630
To be clear, I am paying today.

495
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:47,510
If we go by the order, it should be me.

496
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:49,440
Well, I want to cut in. Is that not allowed?

497
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,370
Fine.

498
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:54,220
What company is it?

499
00:43:58,630 --> 00:44:01,500
Okay. I got it.

500
00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:06,200
Okay. Thanks.

501
00:44:13,770 --> 00:44:15,530
Siyu...

502
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:28,540
A friend just told me that during the Lubao bidding crisis,

503
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:31,900
a company called Langfei spent ¥40,000 on internet ghostwriters

504
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:34,720
 to post harmful comments about Lubao. 

505
00:45:22,330 --> 00:45:23,970
Come in.

506
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:25,490
Director Chen, your delivery.

507
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:26,930
Okay.

508
00:45:29,470 --> 00:45:31,600
I didn't order food, did I?

509
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:34,110
- Did you order it for me? 
 - Not me.

510
00:45:34,110 --> 00:45:36,430
All right. You can go back to work now.

511
00:45:50,390 --> 00:45:56,320
 Eat well, exercise well, rest well, and work well!

♫  Listen to the voice inside  ♫

527
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:59,470
♫  In this lonely world, be cautious ♫

528
00:46:59,470 --> 00:47:01,860
 After we're hurt, we learn to cherish  ♫

529
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:05,120
♫  Dear Myself  ♫

530
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:08,420
♫  Use all your strength  ♫

531
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:12,700
♫  Missing the simple you from the past  ♫

532
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:14,920
♫  Turn difficulties into courage  ♫

533
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:19,570
♫  Don't back down from the crowd  ♫

534
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:22,020
♫  Growth is inevitably accompanied by setbacks  ♫

535
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:24,920
♫  The best way to overcome difficulties is to smile  ♫

536
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:27,120
♫  All the punishment given by fate, are you afraid?  ♫

537
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:29,310
♫  Let everything go, all those concerns, real or fake  ♫

538
00:47:29,310 --> 00:47:32,470
♫  Cannot erase the scar, but it's just a scar  ♫

539
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:34,230
♫  We are so small yet so determined  ♫

540
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:35,890
♫  Occasionally fussy and occasionally firm  ♫

541
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:38,160
♫  If growth leaves a trace, then the trace is left be tears  ♫

542
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:41,890
♫  Your back that I've always been chasing  ♫

543
00:47:41,890 --> 00:47:44,060
♫  Finally turned around to hug me tightly  ♫

544
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:47,640
♫  It's still that familiar you  ♫

545
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:50,930
♫  Yeah...  ♫

546
00:47:50,930 --> 00:47:55,060
♫  Oh...  ♫

547
00:47:57,220 --> 00:48:00,500
♫  Dear Myself  ♫

548
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:03,740
♫  Listen to the voice inside  ♫

549
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:07,790
♫  I'll give you the warm that the wind took  ♫

550
00:48:07,790 --> 00:48:10,230
♫  Hugging you, hugging me  ♫

551
00:48:10,230 --> 00:48:13,480
♫   Dear Myself  ♫

552
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:17,620
♫  The sky has finally cleared  ♫

553
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:20,850
♫  We've never been so clear-headed  ♫

554
00:48:20,850 --> 00:48:23,120
♫  Looking for the past me who  ♫

555
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:26,480
♫  Ran forward without evading anything  ♫

556
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:29,750
♫  Ran forward without evading anything  ♫

557
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:33,090
♫  Listen to the voice inside  ♫

558
00:48:33,090 --> 00:48:37,560
♫  The sky has finally cleared  ♫
