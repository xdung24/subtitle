[Episode 7]

4
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,000
I believe that the police will prove my innocence.

5
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,400
Do you think you could stand up to the investigation?

6
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,700
If I can't then the whole Sales Department cannot stand up to it as well!

7
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,200
Do you want to drag everyone in the Sales Department into this?

8
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,700
Let me tell you. It's impossible. For this situation,

9
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,000
we only have one solution. That is, you quit by yourself!

10
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,100
I won't quit over making a false report on the invoice!

11
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,800
Ziting, where is Sister Yuan?

12
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,000
She went to a meeting.

13
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,800
When will she come back?

14
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,600
I don't know.

15
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 Hello, the subscriber you have dialed is not available right now. Sorry... 

16
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,700
Where is GM Pan?

17
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,000
GM Pan is abroad.

18
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,200
All right. I will contact you again.

19
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,600
 Hello, the subscriber you have dialed has turned off the phone. Sorry... 

20
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,600
His phone is turned off.

21
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,700
I'm guessing he is on the plane at this moment.

22
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,400
- Sister, what exactly is going on? 
 - Sister Siyu!

23
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,300
There is definitely someone making trouble for Sister Siyu!

24
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,800
You guys go back first.

25
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,700
Sister Siyu.

26
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,900
- Did something happen? 
 - Yes.

27
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:48,800
- Is what they said true? 
 - What did they say?

28
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,600
It has been spreading around that you have embezzled hundreds of thousands RMB in recent years.

29
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,600
Nonsense! I didn't embezzle anything!

30
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,800
They said the company has already reported it to the police.

31
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,800
The police station will send someone to arrest you soon.

32
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,000
What exactly is going on?

33
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,100
- Someone is framing me. 
 - Who?

34
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,600
Sister Siyu, I trust that you would never do something like this.

35
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,400
But... do you think you can get out of this?

36
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,100
I don't know.

37
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,300
Then, what should you do?

38
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,500
Let me answer the phone.

39
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:54,480
What's up? Do you need something or do you miss me?

40
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,200
What does you not talking mean?

41
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:02,500
What? Are you letting me admire your beauty quietly?

42
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,100
Wait for me. I'm heading over to you right now.

43
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,200
What's happened?

44
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,200
Take me to abreact first.

45
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Why isn't she answering?

46
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,600
Chen Yiming also isn't answering the phone.

47
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,600
What exactly is going on at your company?

48
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,000
I don't know. When I left,

49
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I heard Director Fang ask HR to fire her.

50
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,300
Fine, fire her! Or she can resign first!

51
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:36,000
Whether it be firing or resigning, she will be blacklisted.

52
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,600
It'll be very difficult for her to find a job in the future.

53
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:45,000
Then wouldn't workaholic Li Siyu be devastated?

54
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,200
That's why I'm worried.

55
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,100
Siyu, go in from the other side.

56
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,500
Why do you kill good people as well? 
 [Zhang Zhizhi]

57
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,540
I can't tell who is good who is bad.

58
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,600
Let's go.

59
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,800
Here is your water.

60
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,400
Thank you.

61
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,200
Now, would you like to tell me?

62
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,800
I don't want to work there anymore.

63
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,600
What happened?

64
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,000
Can you support me?

65
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:49,600
Of course, I am willing to. I've always thought about doing that as well.

66
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,200
I knew you were going to say that.

67
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,000
I will do that as well.

68
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:11,830
Now, do you want to tell me the reason?

69
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,800
It's okay. You have me.

70
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,400
Hello?

71
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,600
Hello, hello. Yes, yes, yes. I'm Chen Yiming.

72
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,850
Right now?

73
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,800
All right. No problem.

74
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,000
Right. I'll head over right now.

75
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,600
Okay. Okay. No problem.

76
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,600
Thank you.

77
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,400
Thank you, Director Mao. See you.

78
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,900
Siyu, my friend introduced me to a job.

79
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:28,800
But the boss wants me to see him now.

80
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,800
Are you leaving?

81
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,200
I need to support you,

82
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,800
so doesn't that mean I have to find a job?

83
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,370
Can you understand me?

84
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,630
Is Li Siyu with you?

85
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,600
Come here quickly to stay with her.

86
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,600
[Shanghai Sjijia Urban Fun Park]

87
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,600
Siyu, Xiaoling says she will come to stay with you very soon.

88
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,800
I don't have much time, I really need to rush over there.

89
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,800
Li Siyu hasn't given in yet?

90
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:13,000
Whether she gives in or not, before Pan Zhiyong comes back,

91
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:15,400
we must fire her.

92
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,600
Isn't this too cruel of us?

93
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,200
Don't worry.

94
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:25,400
Based on her capacity, she can find a job immediately after she leaves.

95
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:29,100
Moreover, she will definitely get one with better conditions.

96
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,200
I mentored her for 7 years,

97
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,610
yet we have ended up like this.

98
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,400
I still don't have the heart to do this.

99
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,400
You mentored her for 7 years,

100
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,800
so you must know her very well.

101
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,500
Will she give you the position of Sales Director willingly?

102
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,700
- She won't. 
 - Based on her capabilities and ambitions,

103
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:59,000
will she be soft-hearted with you in the end?

104
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,380
This ending,

105
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:08,800
starting from the moment Pan Zhiyong picked her as your opponent,

106
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,480
is destined.

107
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,700
You don't need to feel guilty.

108
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,600
After Sister Yuan took over the Sales Department,

109
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,200
she disliked the application for overtime pay, thinking it was troublesome,

110
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,400
so she had me just add it directly to the PR fees.

111
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,000
She would just sign an approval.

112
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,620
So this issue...

113
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:39,400
is Sister Yuan framing you behind the scenes?

114
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:44,500
Except for her, nobody knows that I reported ¥500 more for reimbursement that day.

115
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:48,000
Furthermore, she could have cleared it up when the Supervising Department was investigating.

116
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,600
But she said that she didn't know.

117
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:56,000
Also, I still can't get in contact with her now.

118
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,500
Bitch!

119
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,200
What if you go to ask other colleagues in the Sales Department?

120
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,400
What if other colleagues are willing to prove

121
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,000
that you have this unofficial rule in the department?

122
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I think you can explain this, right?

123
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,200
Most of them are Sister Yuan's team members.

124
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,000
Will they help me?

125
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,800
So the key to solving this...

126
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:31,620
is Sister Yuan. We have to find her.

127
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,790
I think based on the relationship between you and Sister Yuan,

128
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:37,000
she wouldn't be so ruthless. Right?

129
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,800
From Lin Ling's situation, I've discovered

130
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,600
that she has changed.

131
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,000
I think there is not much to discuss about this situation.

132
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,200
First, do not quit unless they clear this up and give you your innocence back.

133
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:56,800
Second, if it is this Yuan Huizhong framing you, then fuck her up!

134
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,000
How?

135
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,900
Make a big deal out of it!

136
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,900
Our Liu Yang got promoted!

137
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,800
I think it is either director or section chief.

138
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,880
Anyways, he got promoted.

139
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,200
He is busy every day.

140
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,910
Of course, I stay at Liu Yang's house!

141
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:30,200
His house is quite big.

142
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,000
I have my own room.

143
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,500
All right. I'm boiling water. I'm busy right now.

144
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,000
We'll talk another time. I'm hanging up.

145
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Yuwei, have some water.

146
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,500
Liu Yang,

147
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,800
let me ask you something.

148
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,600
Go ahead, Mom.

149
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,400
Did your wife drink the medicines that I sent to you guys?

150
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,500
She should have drank them.

151
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,400
She didn't drink them at all. The medicines are hidden in the kitchen cabinet.

152
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,000
I saw them!

153
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,800
Mom, if she doesn't want to drink them, lets not force her.

154
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:44,800
Also, we haven't made any plans for a second child.

155
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,400
Then, when do you plan to?

156
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,400
There's no rush.

157
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,400
Why not? Yuwei has already gotten this big.

158
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,600
Also, the country is encouraging everyone to have a second child.

159
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,800
You have to support this policy, right?

160
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,400
We have to follow the policy!

161
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,600
Mom, the country has stopped the only-child policy.

162
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:07,000
But every family's situation is different.

163
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,370
The situation of our family

164
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:12,400
is you should seize the time to have a second child. Do you understand?

165
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,400
Look!  My body is still well. If my legs aren't working well in a few years,

166
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,800
who will help you if you have a baby?

167
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,400
Mom, I'm busy. Lets talk about this later.

168
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,000
This is a big thing. Pay attention to it!

169
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,400
Okay! I will discuss it with Zhizhi later.

170
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,800
What is there to discuss? Why do you need to discuss it with her?

171
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,000
You decide this!

172
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,400
Grandma, I want to eat cookies!

173
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:41,500
Eat cookies? Your mom already said you can't eat things freely.

174
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,800
Have you listened to what I said?

175
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,800
Yes, I did.

176
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,900
Wait for me. I will get cookies for you.

177
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,400
This one.

178
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,600
Slowly.

179
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,680
Take a good rest when you get back.

180
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,600
Don't think about anything.

181
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,600
Watch the steps! Slowly!

182
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,320
Get your spirits up. You have a lot to do tomorrow.

183
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,400
I asked Chen Yiming to come and pick you up.

184
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,600
Thank you.

185
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:46,000
If you need anything, just tell us. We are here for you.

186
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,500
I have watched all the palace dramas. I know all the evil tricks!

187
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,100
Let's go.

188
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,100
Slowly!

189
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,600
Bag.

190
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,900
Be careful.

191
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,600
We're leaving now.

192
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,000
Drink some warm honey water.

193
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,200
Sorry.

194
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,800
I wasn't able to stay with you all day today.

195
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,800
Are there any new developments in the situation?

196
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,600
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

197
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,700
How was your job interview?

198
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,660
You should know that I was wronged.

199
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:02,940
We have been using this method to get our overtime pay in the past six months.

200
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:05,660
Sister Siyu, I want to help you.

201
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:08,290
But at this moment, if I admit it,

202
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:10,870
I will lose my PR fees as well.

203
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:15,120
- Won't I be walking myself into a trap? 
 - But if you don't help me now,

204
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,050
in the future, if the Supervising Department finds out, then they will definitely report you.

205
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:23,760
I... let me think about it.

206
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:29,630
[Li Siyu, please go to the Finance Department.]

207
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,370
You came.

208
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:58,650
Take these falsely reported invoices back and then give me new invoices

209
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:02,600
for overtime pay according to the amount on these invoices.

210
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:05,220
What do you mean?

211
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:08,730
Also, from now on, overtime pay is overtime pay.

212
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:13,260
PR expenses are PR expenses. Don't mix them up, all right?

213
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,790
What exactly happened?

214
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:19,770
GM Pan came back early.

215
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,260
Come in!

216
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:41,390
GM Pan, I want to explain the situation to you.

217
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:44,450
From beginning to end, I have never falsely reported PR fees.

218
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:46,330
This matter is over now.

219
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:49,110
I have to explain it even if it's over.

220
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:52,400
- I don't want to hear it. 
 - Why?

221
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,950
Because I know you.

222
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:58,630
You would never do such a thing for ¥500.

223
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:00,590
You were wronged.

224
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:04,150
GM Pan.

225
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:08,020
Li Siyu,

226
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:11,400
this... I helped you get over this obstacle.

227
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,810
But I can't guarantee that

228
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:16,790
I will be able to help you next time.

229
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:21,180
Do you know what you must do so that trouble doesn't find you?

230
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:25,830
You must be in a high enough position so that trouble can't reach you.

231
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,960
GM Pan, I understand.

232
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:37,520
Don't worry. I will be a good team leader.

233
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,950
In three months, I will be the Sales Director.

234
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:42,730
Great.

235
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:18,760
- Xiaojia. 
 - Yes, Sis?

236
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,880
- Do we still have the wine from last time? 
 - Yes.

237
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,090
- Pour it out. 
 - Got it.

238
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,310
- Sis. 
 - Pour it.

239
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:42,360
Since everyone trusts me and is willing to follow me,

240
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,160
I will not let you guys down.

241
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,130
We must work hard to do our best together.

242
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:50,650
It doesn't matter who will be the director after three months, the important thing is that

243
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:53,530
we must not let the company, our friends, and ourselves down.

244
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:56,050
- Cheers! 
 - Cheers!

245
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:01,060
Sister Siyu, all of us will listen to you.

246
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:03,400
We will let our characters speak for us and let our strength prove what we are capable of.

247
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:06,670
- We must do better than them. 
 - Ch—

248
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:08,900
- Let's drink.

249
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,550
Sister Ziru.

250
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,270
That's a bit too long. You haven't changed jobs in ten years.

251
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:06,410
-  Your experience is lacking. 
 - I dare not recommend you to my clients.

252
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:09,140
- Our company products are targeted for post-90s. 
 - They won't want you.

253
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:11,710
 I suggest you get a few more years of experience before applying for the position.

254
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:14,860
 Your age is too old for us.

255
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,230
Where are you?

256
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:38,450
- Near your company. 
 - Then I'll go find you.

257
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,440
I have good news to tell you.

258
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,530
 Send me your location.

259
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:45,250
Okay.

260
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:54,690
When have you become interested in this social circle?

261
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:56,830
Ever since my dad had a passion,

262
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:59,460
he forced me to work in this field.

263
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:02,070
It's too boring; it's not interesting at all.

264
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,730
- I'm leaving. 
 - Wait a moment.

265
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:06,710
My dad arranged a connoisseur to discuss some things with me.

266
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:10,260
- Let's go together. 
 - That's fine.

267
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,270
- Let me answer this call. 
 - Okay.

268
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:28,740
This brushstroke has me obsessed.

269
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:33,700
- Then you must like Mondrian’s earlier works better. 
 - Who?

270
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,770
A master of "De Stijl." 
 (T/N: Dutch art movement)

271
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:38,750
Don't tell me you've never heard of him?

272
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:41,750
Of course, I have heard about him. It's just...

273
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:45,640
The person you are talking about, she has several of his work hanging in her house.

274
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:50,120
You collect Mondrian's paintings? Which ones do you have?

275
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,200
The most famous one.

276
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,830
- Could it be the "Red, Blue and Yellow"? 
 - Exactly!

277
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:58,240
That's the one.

278
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,790
Miss Gu, my biggest dream

279
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:06,080
is to see Mondrian's work with my own eyes.

280
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,180
Please let me go to your home.

281
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:13,380
T-This... we can talk about it another time.

282
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:16,080
A friend is looking for me. I will go over there for a moment.

283
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,640
Miss Gu.

284
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,320
Miss Gu!

285
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:35,850
Mondrian. Neoplasticism.

286
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:40,710
Neoplasticism.

287
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:43,050
Mondrian. Neoplasticism.

288
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:46,020
Pure abstraction.

289
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:49,640
Mondrian. Neoplasticism. Pure abstraction.

290
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:53,500
GM Pan came back early.

291
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,970
He helped me take care of the invoice situation.

292
00:30:56,850 --> 00:31:00,700
Finance Department told me to submit an overtime payment application to make up for it.

293
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,710
The matter is settled.

294
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:10,590
- That simply? 
 - It was originally something out of nothing,

295
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:12,810
it's back to the original point now.

296
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:16,190
That's good.

297
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:21,060
Sister Yuan and I have completely torn apart.

298
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:25,780
This is the end to seven years of her being my mentor and friend.

299
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,630
What a pity.

300
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:40,700
Did I do something wrong?

301
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,610
You didn't do anything wrong.

302
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,090
It's...

303
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:49,970
too complicated.

304
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:57,320
Must we experience all this just to become a sales director?

305
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:02,600
In the battlefield... m-must we disregard feelings?

306
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,760
If I knew the answer,

307
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,970
I wouldn't have lost my job.

308
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:20,880
Oh, right. Have you gotten a job yet?

309
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:31,660
Can we not talk about this?

310
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:40,850
Doctrine. Pure abstraction.

311
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:29,670
- Sorry. 
 - It's okay.

312
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,200
Amazing.

313
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:41,900
You understand it?

314
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:45,880
Deconstruction.

315
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:51,720
My friend recommended me to buy it. Do you think this can appreciate?

316
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:54,820
Deconstruction stuff appreciates every year.

317
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:58,220
But Mbappe and Suarez...

318
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:02,420
are believers of deconstruction.

319
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:05,290
Of course, Cristiano  Ronaldo and Pogba 
 (T/N: famous European soccer players)

320
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:08,780
would not agree with this viewpoint.

321
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:11,450
Miss Gu, what do you think?

322
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,430
Sorry. Are those you have mentioned all artists?

323
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:17,930
Yes.

324
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:20,530
Why do they all sound so familiar?

325
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:23,160
Excuse me.

326
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:29,870
I think you can

327
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:32,420
- consider buying this painting. 
 - Really?

328
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:33,000
Amazing.

329
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:39,030
Oh, Sister Ziru called me today.

330
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:42,590
She invited us to attend a new energy lecture this weekend.

331
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:44,460
Let's go together.

332
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,040
Forget it.

333
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:50,540
Sister Ziru specially asked you to go.

334
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:53,790
I don't want to go.

335
00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:56,970
Let's go, let's go.

336
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:00,350
You are free anyways.

337
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:03,550
Instead of staying at home all day, go walk around outside.

338
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:06,030
Maybe you will come across an opportunity.

339
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:19,570
How do you know that I'm idle all day?

340
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:23,470
I went to a lot of places today.

341
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:28,610
I mean, Sister Ziru has many friends.

342
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:31,240
Maybe she can introduce you to a job.

343
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:35,290
It's my own business, I can solve it myself. I don't need outsiders to help me.

344
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:13,060
Your official competition with Sister Yuan is about to start.

345
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,870
Are you confident?

346
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:22,070
When discussing personal capabilities, I don't lose to her.

347
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:24,260
Discussing about teams,

348
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:27,510
although she has almost all the elites of the Sales Department,

349
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:29,460
but my team is younger

350
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:32,750
and more hard-working. I can also go poach people from the outside.

351
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:35,100
The only thing I lack in comparison to her

352
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:37,970
is that I don't have as many customers as she does.

353
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:41,560
After I get back home, I can comb through some of my former clients

354
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,970
to see if you can use them.

355
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:47,300
No need.

356
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,850
What I need is mature sales

357
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:52,740
for a fierce fight.

358
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:07,810
Aren't you going to be busier than before then?

359
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:09,960
I don't have a choice.

360
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:16,320
It's only three months,

361
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:18,950
I can hold out.

362
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:20,750
I believe that you can hold out

363
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:23,220
but can your body take it? Can you bear all that stress?

364
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:25,450
I think it's no problem.

365
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,480
You travel weekly, work overtime every day, and drink during every meal with clients.

366
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,690
Can your stomach take all that?

367
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:37,340
Do you want to talk about business trips, overtime, drinking, or my stomach?

368
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:40,820
What I want to say is, you don't need to work that hard.

369
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:45,290
- But... 
 - But what?

370
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,950
But I don't have a job now.

371
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:52,780
I don't need you to support me. I can rely on myself.

372
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:03,640
I—

373
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:06,660
What I am saying is not what are you thinking.

374
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:14,400
I know you want what's good for me.

375
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:19,680
I also know you are in a bad mood.

376
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:23,690
Let's not quarrel, okay?

377
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:52,490
You can't be out for too long, right?

378
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,560
Hurry back to work then.

379
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:12,520
How about you?

380
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:16,010
Me? I will sit for a bit and then I'll leave.

381
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:24,320
Then, I'm leaving.

382
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:07,030
I'm bored looking at the exhibition.

383
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:09,080
Where do you want to go tonight?

384
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,360
I'll talk to you later.

385
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,000
What are you doing?

386
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:32,330
Hey, Miss.

387
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:35,540
The chair is very long.

388
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:37,620
Or I can sit in the car.

389
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,210
Why are you here?

390
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:48,390
I have been here all along.

391
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:50,080
Who is looking for you?

392
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,850
- I'm looking for my girlfriend. 
 - She's your girlfriend?

393
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:56,680
I'm sorry. My girlfriend and I have something to do, I'll talk to you later.

394
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:03,710
What's your problem? You keep haunting me. What do you want?

395
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:06,050
- I'm helping you. 
 - Are we close?

396
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:08,600
Do I need your help?

397
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,580
Let me tell you.

398
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:15,120
That man's name is Xiao Kehe's my middle school classmate. I know him very well.

399
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:19,580
I know his personality very well. He is the upgraded version of Lan Ke.

400
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:24,130
Don't believe it? Look at his WeChat Moment. 
 (T/N: WeChat moment is equivalent to Facebook feed)

401
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:25,850
Look.

402
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:34,290
Look. To old classmates,

403
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:37,250
he is pretty true to himself. To women,

404
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:39,760
he is a true piece of trash.

405
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,970
So dangerous.

406
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:45,820
So you can't judge a man just by the money he has.

407
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:48,830
Don't leave. I saved you.

408
00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:51,060
You should treat me to meal or I can treat you to a meal.

409
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:55,470
- You are Lei... 
 - Thunder rolling in the sky— 
 (Thunder is "lei")

410
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:58,320
Thunder rolling in the sky, listen.

411
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,890
Scram as far away as you can!

412
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:04,380
Why are you so ungrateful? Won't your conscience hurt?

413
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:08,790
Gu Xiaoling! Listen well! From now on, I won't get involved in your business!

414
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:11,680
Otherwise, let there be thunder and let lightning strike me!

439
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:44,070

441
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:49,530
♫  Cannot erase the scar, but it's just a scar  ♫

442
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:51,030
♫  We are so small yet so determined  ♫

443
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:52,820
♫  Occasionally fussy and occasionally firm  ♫

444
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:55,200
♫  If growth leaves a trace, then the trace is left be tears  ♫
