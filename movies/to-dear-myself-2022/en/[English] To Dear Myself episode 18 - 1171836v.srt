[Episode 18]

4
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,800
How are you doing lately?

5
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,200
It's okay.

6
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,800
What do you mean by okay? You are doing excellently for sure.

7
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:47,190
What are you up to recently?

8
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,290
I'm doing research about Lubao.

9
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Research about Lubao?

10
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,800
About what?

11
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,800
You shouldn't ask me. I won't tell you.

12
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,400
Why?

13
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:07,000
Because GM Pan and President Wang are rivals in negotiations.

14
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,100
We work for different companies. We do our own job.

15
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,200
This is a career requirement.

16
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,200
Why do I feel distant suddenly?

17
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,400
How come?

18
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,800
This is nothing to do with us. It's just work.

19
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,500
What if I feel It's related to us?

20
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:34,570
If you feel so,

21
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,000
then you need to change your mentality in the future.

22
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,400
I don't ask about your work.

23
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,100
I won't reveal my work to you as well.

24
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,100
Okay!

25
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:54,200
Then let's change topics.

26
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,100
Are you satisfied with the house?

27
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,400
Absolutely. As long as it belongs to you and me.

28
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,600
I'm always satisfied.

29
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,100
Sorry for keeping you waiting long.

30
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,000
How can I help you?

31
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
We decide to buy the apartment we saw last time.

32
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,800
The one on Jiangyang Rd?

33
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,000
Yes.

34
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:22,160
Mr. Chen called me yesterday and I took it down incorrectly. I wrote down another one.

35
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,500
That one was sold a few days ago.

36
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:28,760
Let's have a look at others?

37
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,600
Here you go. Thank you.

38
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,200
Okay.

39
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,000
Older brother.

40
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,200
Get one for me.

41
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,200
You bought one the other day, right?

42
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,100
I want to buy another one.

43
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,800
This is for you.

44
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,000
For me?

45
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,300
You said your stomach wasn't well, right? Take this to drink more hot water.

46
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:12,000
Brother Yang, I know this brand.

47
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,400
It's expensive.

48
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,200
It's just a thermal cup.

49
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,000
Thank you.

50
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:26,990
Look at you. Why are you tearing up?

51
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,200
You are too nice to me.

52
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,400
Silly girl.

53
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,200
Didn't you say it's an art exhibition?

54
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,000
Yes.

55
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,600
The exhibitors are all selected in Florence Biennale.

56
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,700
They are definitely top-level.

57
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,800
Beautiful.

58
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:56,600
Actually, jewelry design also has classicism, Orientalism,

59
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,000
abstractionism. They also can be affected by abstractionism.

60
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,200
Picasso's daughter is the representative of surrealism.

61
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,400
Tiffany is modernistic.

62
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,200
What style do you prefer?

63
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:17,700
Me... My favorite is Tiffany's paper flower series.

64
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,400
It integrates the modern with rigidness and softness.

65
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,800
It's rather romantic and harmonious.

66
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,500
Now I know. Wait for me.

67
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,600
Thank you.

68
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,500
Xiao Ling, you will like it definitely.

69
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,400
You are right.

70
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:34,400
The designer's mastery of the shadow, color, and lines is wonderful.

71
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,800
Each of the design drawings is art.

72
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,000
It is!

73
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,600
If you say he loves me, he wears an expensive watch.

74
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,400
He drives a luxurious car and lives in such a big villa.

75
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,600
And he just gave me this. If you say he doesn't love me,

76
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,800
he asks me out for food every day. He sends me countless messages

77
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,500
full of love. It's not like acting.

78
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,600
This is not love and romance.

79
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:06,100
This is being stingy.

80
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:09,800
If a man really likes a woman, he is definitely willing to spend money on her if it's within his competence.

81
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,000
Xiaoling, break up with him.

82
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
No!

83
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,400
Why?

84
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,200
I don't want to regret it when I get old.

85
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:20,000
There was such a good man in front of me. But I gave up by myself.

86
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,700
But this man doesn't love you.

87
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:24,200
No. He loves me.

88
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,800
He is just stingy.

89
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,800
It does matter. After getting married, his money is my money. I can spend it freely.

90
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,800
Such a stingy man,

91
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,400
will share his money with you?

92
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,600
Xiaoling, do you love him?

93
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,600
I love money and he has money. So I love him.

94
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,200
If you love money so much, why don't you go and make some yourself? Why do you have to depend on a man?

95
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,400
Li Siyu,

96
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:54,800
you are smart, capable, and went to a good university.

97
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,200
I was not this type and my family couldn't help me as well.

98
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,000
My only advantage is having this face.

99
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,400
Rich people are not stupid.

100
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Even if they like you, why should they marry you?

101
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,200
So I tried to enrich myself and made myself become more capable.

102
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,200
I work out every day and I play golf very well.

103
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,200
I read all the subscriptions on WeChat.

104
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,800
Can you manage to read them all?

105
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,800
So I learn art appreciation from him.

106
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,400
I changed my job from a real estate company to the golf club and

107
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:26,000
to the art gallery. My next step is to learn English.

108
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,800
I'm not cutting corners like you think.

109
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,000
It's tiring.

110
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,800
You think that if you marry a guy from a rich family that everything will be okay?

111
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,200
What if he has a mistress?

112
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,200
You think you find a poor boy and there won't be a mistress?

113
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,000
I trust Liu Yang anyway.

114
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,800
Don't listen to her. I think Liu Yang and Yiming are both not like that.

115
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,100
By the way, how are you doing with Liu Yang?

116
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,800
Yesterday, he

117
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:04,400
bought an expensive thermal cup for me.

118
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,200
A thermal cup makes you this happy?

119
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,400
Well, it's still better than a picture album.

120
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,600
Zhizhi, you followed bad examples! You satirized me!

121
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,000
Don't.

122
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You made peace?

123
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,400
Family issues will never be finished.

124
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,400
Zhizhi, why didn't you wear the clothes I gave to you?

125
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,000
Why are you still using this bag?

126
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,800
They are too expensive. I'm reluctant to use them.

127
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,200
You are not promising.

128
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,200
Zhizhi, I asked you last time.

129
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,000
Are you willing to work for me in the sales department?

130
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,600
Thank you, Sister Siyu.

131
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,000
I've discussed it with Liu Yang.

132
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,800
Yuwei is still very young.

133
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,800
She can't leave her mom. I will think about it in the future.

134
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,500
I told them, Liu Yang

135
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,800
won't cheat on me certainly.

136
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:19,200
Can you talk about more meaningful topics when you women get together?

137
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,200
Meaningful?

138
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,200
Why haven't you thrown this cup away?

139
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,200
It's still good. Why throw it away?

140
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,800
Use the new one.

141
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,600
They are both the same. Both for drinking water.

142
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,000
Where did you put the cup I bought for you?

143
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,400
I refunded it.

144
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,000
Refund?

145
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,400
It's too expensive.

146
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,400
When I refunded it in the shopping mall,

147
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,600
they didn't let me at the beginning.

148
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,000
They said I didn't have a receipt.

149
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,600
You know what happened afterwards?

150
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,400
I told them that if you don't refund my money,

151
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,600
I will report to the shopping mall about doing business in the street.

152
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,000
A cup...

153
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,200
- It's a whole lifetime. 
 (T/N: Cup and lifetime sound very similar in Mandarin.) 
 - Then they finally softened,

154
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:09,800
and refunded me with a shopping coupon in the end. It's also okay.

155
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:28,400
When will your mom go back?

156
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,480
I will persuade her step-by-step.

157
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:54,080
It seems that for the valuation of Lubao, we each

158
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,600
have quite a few disagreements.

159
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,960
I don't think president Wang is confident enough about Lubao.

160
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,680
Confidence should come from strength.

161
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,260
But don't forget I still have

162
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:10,330
Lubao3, which is far superior to Lubao2.

163
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:16,150
GM Pan, I heard Lubao3 has flaws.

164
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:19,540
This is from Gao Zhengdao, right?

165
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,720
To sell his own theory,

166
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,180
he attacks everyone. He's almost out of his mind now.

167
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:30,670
I will find a time to write an article to fight back

168
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:34,350
in order to sober him up and ensure the public to have a correct understanding of the facts.

169
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:37,560
I attended the professor's lecture, but my conclusion

170
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,220
is not drawn from him.

171
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:43,520
My company did a bit of research.

172
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,400
[Lubao Valuation Report]

173
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:27,200
Teacher Wu, I inquired a lot.

174
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,260
I couldn't find a chance to strike.

175
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:33,330
I think he is preventing me on purpose.

176
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:38,650
What if we reveal

177
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:41,530
the relationship between Liu Yang and Li Siyu?

178
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:42,920
It hasn't been verified yet.

179
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,870
But if we don't take action now.

180
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:48,070
Next week, when those five experts open the bid, we're doomed.

181
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:49,990
How do you know it's five experts?

182
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:52,330
Director asked me to entertain them.

183
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:56,130
I'm working on their travel and meals.

184
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:59,040
- You know which five experts? 
 - Of course.

185
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:08,590
Have a look! Read carefully!

186
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:13,620
Why did Wang Ziru have this report but I have nothing?

187
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:17,360
Wang Ziru knows the problem it reflects but I don't!

188
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,540
Why?

189
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:22,500
GM Pan, we actually are also working on this.

190
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,890
We planned to hand it to you at the end of this month.

191
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:28,180
It's a dereliction of duty to fall further behind than others!

192
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:30,910
GM Pan, from the perspective of testing data,

193
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:33,330
Lubao3 doesn't have issues at all.

194
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:34,800
User experience is

195
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,730
always much more important than the data test.

196
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:40,300
But the issues reflected in this report are biased indeed.

197
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:44,070
But it put me on the defensive in the negotiations.

198
00:15:56,090 --> 00:16:00,380
Li Siyu, don't think you are not involved in this issue.

199
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:02,940
Answer me. What have you been up to lately?

200
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,820
I'm working hard on the target to closing the ¥500,000,000 deal in 3 months.

201
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:08,620
- How much have you closed? 
 - Over ¥200,000,000.

202
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:14,520
This report made us lose ¥300,000,000!

203
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,310
As sales director, you only care about sales performance,

204
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:22,590
but neglecting your product, this is also a dereliction of duty!

205
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:33,460
GM Pan, I think this report reminds us

206
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,770
that before Lubao3 reaches perfection,

207
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:38,420
if we promote this into the market on a large scale,

208
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,940
I'm afraid it's a bit risky.

209
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:43,890
Let me ask you... What's perfection?

210
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:47,240
What is perfection?

211
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:51,350
It's already perfect to upgrade the product!

212
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:56,130
Is it risky to improve the performance of the product while it is in use?

213
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:58,980
If it takes a risk, then I will certainly do it!

214
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,730
Look into this report.

215
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:08,990
Find the weakness. I must win back in the next round of the negotiations.

216
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:13,710
That's all for today. Li Siyu, stay.

217
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:37,450
- How is the bidding going? 
 - Almost done.

218
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:41,430
GM Pan, before printing and packaging, would you like to have a look?

219
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:43,060
No need.

220
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,860
Not even check the quote?

221
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:48,410
You decide by yourself. I only have one requirement:

222
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:51,580
You must win this bidding.

223
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:55,360
GM Pan, no one can promise this.

224
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,750
You must promise me.

225
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:02,850
Li Siyu, this is the situation.

226
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:04,950
This report...

227
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:10,050
makes our only hope uncertain now.

228
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:14,150
So we must win the bidding. Otherwise, you and I

229
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:17,580
will both be kicked out.

230
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,290
This is from you, right?

231
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:38,290
Yes.

232
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:41,040
Why did you secretly investigate Lubao?

233
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,840
First, I didn't secretly investigate.

234
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:50,440
I did it open and aboveboard. Second, I mentioned it with you before.

235
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,050
But you didn't say you were investigating Lubao3.

236
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:54,840
Could I tell you all?

237
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:06,250
Do you know, your report makes my hard work for the whole month in vain.

238
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,120
That means you didn't do your job well.

239
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,680
Why do you talk like old Pan?

240
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:13,580
You were scolded by Old Pan?

241
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,340
Yes. Very angrily.

242
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:20,910
This means that Old Pan got beaten in the negotiations with President Wang.

243
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,200
You are even laughing now!

244
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,220
This means I did my work well. Of course, I should laugh.

245
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:31,400
What work? Look at your wording. It's complete slander!

246
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,260
Every word in this report is true.

247
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:38,410
Lubao is worth less than ¥4,000,000,000. Is it true?

248
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:41,050
If Lubao3 can solve the problem that I put forward,

249
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:43,380
then Lubao could reach a value of ¥4,000,000,000.

250
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,460
But now, it definitely can't.

251
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:48,100
Why do you just focus on the problems but neglect the advantages?

252
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,350
This is my job!

253
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:54,020
My job is to remind my boss to avoid trouble and to be careful.

254
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,440
Have you ever thought about if

255
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,540
my boss was to know that this was from you. What would he think of me?

256
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,430
These are two different things.

257
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:06,450
This is the same! He will even think that I revealed something to you.

258
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:08,620
Wang Ziru will also think of this.

259
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:15,350
So you are sacrificing me.

260
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:20,240
I'm not.

261
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,720
I'm doing my job. You didn't know anything.

262
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,430
Who will believe this?

263
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:27,260
Believe it or not, we have to

264
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:30,330
try to do our own jobs.

265
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:34,550
The problem is that you could have done a lot of things, but why did you just work on this report!

266
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,760
This is the biggest project in Tianye.

267
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:01,770
Since I've started working in Tianye,

268
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:04,380
I have to do something to prove myself.

269
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:09,390
The result of proving yourself is to put me in danger.

270
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,930
This is exaggerating. Does it have something to do with us?

271
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:14,520
I said this is a game between two companies.

272
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,750
We started to play a game between our companies.

273
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:21,270
I didn't want to play games with you.

274
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:25,560

I will put it straight. Even though I'm the team leader,

287

I can't decide on the result in the end.

Why did you take them out and give them to Yuwei?

318

Why can't we still eat them?

Yuwei, wait here for Mom. Come on.

352
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:17,680
You didn't send her here late. It's not life-threatening for the moment.

353
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,300
Doctor, what kind of sickness does my mom have?

354
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:25,290
The tentative diagnosis is acute myocarditis with a probably blocked artery.

355
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,640
Is it serious?

356
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,540
We will know the details only after a coronary angiography.

357
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,630
The patient needs to rest in bed and have a light diet during this period of time.

358
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:40,670
Never stimulate the patient's emotions.

359
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,770
I understand.

360
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:49,120
Prepare for the angiography for now.

361
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,460
Why did my mom get sick all of a sudden?

362
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:03,270
We had a fight.

363
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:09,460
I knew it.

364
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:17,110
I didn't know it would be like this. If I knew I would have...

365
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:19,260
Normally at home,

366
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:23,430
you always argue a lot with my mom.

367
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:28,160
How can you have such a grudge?

368
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:31,250
How can you not distinguish black from white?

369
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:44,190
It's okay for you to lose your temper with me.

370
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:48,840
My mom is old and her health is not good. You fought with her. You did it deliberately!

371
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:28,820
Dad!

372
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:30,290
Come here.

373
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:03,860
Brother Yang, is Aunt okay?

374
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:08,390
It's not life-threatening at the moment.

375
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:18,380
Are you okay? Can I do anything?

376
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,860
Thank you.

377
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:17,950
Mom gave Yuwei some already expired chips that were in the trash.

378
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:20,430
So we fought.

379
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,740
Usually, I can tolerate what Mom says.

380
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:31,390
But when it comes to Yuwei, I can't.

381
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:52,200
The things I said before were a bit strong. I'm sorry.

382
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:07,400
[Will Aunt be okay?]

383
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,110
Go sit and rest for a bit.

384
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:08,910
You finally answered your phone.

385
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,600
I'm a bit busy now.

386
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,600
Where are you right now?

387
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,800
The company.

388
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,400
I'm coming to pick you up.

389
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,400
Now?

390
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:23,900
Siyu, I want to see you and talk with you.

391
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,200
Let's meet tomorrow.

392
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,700
I don't have time today.

393
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,500
No. I must see you today.

394
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:05,570
I assumed you didn't have dinner.

395
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,600
I made some congee for you.

396
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,600
I don't have an appetite.

397
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,800
You have to eat.

398
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,200
Let's go.

399
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,500
Are you still angry with me?

400
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,200
No.

401
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,800
I have thought about it today.

402
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:57,600
You questioned me today that I can do so many things,

403
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,200
but only did this one?

404
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,400
Indeed, I didn't consider your situation well.

405
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,000
I was rushed to prove my value in Tianye.

406
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:12,300
The most important thing in Tianye now is the negotiation with Lubao.

407
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:16,300
So, I first seized this breakthrough point.

408
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,000
Also, I habitually thought

409
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,800
the investigation into the brand had nothing to do with the sales director.

410
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:27,010
Sorry.

411
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,900
It was my fault. I apologize to you.

412
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:38,770
It was not your fault.

413
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:42,450
It's a problem with our work.

414
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,200
I've already assigned work to my team.

415
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:50,000
Try to make up the loss caused by your report.

416
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,800
Here you are.

417
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,800
What's this?

418
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,600
When I investigated Lubao3,

419
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,200
I asked in passing

420
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:09,200
the situation of Lubao's advertising and post-sales service.

421
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:13,200
You should give it to your President Wang.

422
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:17,000
She doesn't pay attention to this. But as a sales director,

423
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,200
I think you need this.

424
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:23,400
I wrote my suggestions on the last few pages.

425
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,100
I hope I can smooth over a fault.

426
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,600
Thanks.

427
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,060
Siyu,

428
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,500
let's go to check the apartment tomorrow and sign the contract.

429
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:59,000
What's up? Are you still angry with me?

430
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,000
No. I was thinking about other things.

431
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,800
What?

432
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,800
Lin Ling has a client.

433
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,000
It's very important to her, to everyone, and to the company.

434
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,600
She must get it.

435
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,000
We have a grey zone now.

436
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,800
It can increase the assurance of getting the client.

437
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,000
Do you think if she should try the grey zone?

438
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,800
What do you think?

439
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,600
I... I don't know.

440
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,800
You just said it was a grey zone.

441
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,000
It means you already have your own judgment.

442
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
But I'm afraid of losing this client as well.

443
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:45,300
Siyu, we've known each other for five years. You are never afraid of losing clients.

444
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:48,990
Even if you lose them, you can find back others easily.

445
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Am I so capable?

446
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Of course.

447
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,400
Actually, it's not terrible to lose the clients.

448
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:59,600
What's terrible is that you will lose other things that

449
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,300
you can never find back.

450
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,900
Let's buy a house and sign the contract tomorrow!

451
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,600
- Liu Yang, 
 - Director.

452
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,800
I want to ask you to do me a favor.

453
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,800
Anytime. Go ahead.

454
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:25,100
My mom is hospitalized now. I want to borrow some money from you.

455
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:29,400
This... Wait a minute.

456
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:33,200
- Who is that? 
 - It's Liu Yang. 

457
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,800
It's Liu Yang. His mom is sick and wants to borrow some money.

458
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,000
Borrow money? How much? Is he able to pay it back? 

459
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,600
Did your cousin pay back the money?

460
00:42:49,090 --> 00:42:50,710
Mom,

461
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,000
how are you feeling now?

462
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,000
I'm okay. Better now.

463
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,600
Drink some water.

464
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:03,100
No. I don't need it.

465
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,800
I'm really okay.

466
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,500
I'll go outside to answer the phone.

467
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,000
- Hello? 
 - Liu Yang.

468
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,800
My wife doesn't agree. I don't have a solution. 

469
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:35,100
What if I give you ¥5,000 out of my own pocket money?

470
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:37,600
No worries, Director. I will think about other ways.

471
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,800
Sorry for being unable to help.

472
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,600
What are you talking about? Thank you all the same.

473
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,300
Lao Xiao, I want to ask you to do me a favor.

474
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:51,500
My mom is in the hospital waiting for bypass surgery.

475
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:54,000
You just bought a house.

476
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Congratulations!

477
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,800
Old classmate, may I ask you to do me a favor?

478
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:03,000
I got it. It's not easy to start up a business now.

479
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,600
It's okay. I will think about other solutions.

480
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,100
Sure. Let's catch up soon.

481
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,100
Hello?

482
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:23,600
Hi, Sir. We just started to sell a new commercial property. Are you interested in knowing more?

483
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,400
No need.

484
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:38,000
Bed No.34, have you paid the surgery fee?

485
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
No, I haven't.

486
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,400
Don't take too long. There are many people queuing for the surgery.

487
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:44,400
If you pay earlier, you can have the surgery earlier.

488
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,800
Yes.

489
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:09,200
Mom, what would you like to eat? I will ask Zhizhi to cook and send it here.

490
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:13,600
How much will the surgery cost?

491
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:16,900
You don't need to worry about it. I have already saved enough money.

492
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:20,000
I don't want to do it.

493
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Mom, you have to have it.

494
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:26,000
Do you really have enough money?

495
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,700
Enough. No worries.

♫  If growth leaves a trace, then the trace is left be tears  ♫

526
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:09,200
♫  Your back that I've always been chasing  ♫

527
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,600
♫  Finally turned around to hug me tightly  ♫

528
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:15,000
♫  It's still that familiar you  ♫

529
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,400
♫  Yeah... ♫

530
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,400
♫ Oh...  ♫

531
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:28,000
♫  Dear Myself  ♫

532
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,200
♫  Listen to the voice inside  ♫

533
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:35,200
♫  I'll give you the warm that the wind took  ♫

534
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,800
♫  Hugging you, hugging me  ♫

535
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:41,000
♫  Dear Myself  ♫

536
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:45,000
♫  The sky has finally cleared  ♫

537
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,300
♫  We've never been so clear-headed  ♫

538
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:50,400
♫  Looking for the past me who  ♫

539
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:54,000
♫  Ran forward without evading anything  ♫

540
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,200
♫  Ran forward without evading anything  ♫

541
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:00,600
♫  Listen to the voice inside  ♫

542
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:04,500
♫  The sky has finally cleared  ♫
