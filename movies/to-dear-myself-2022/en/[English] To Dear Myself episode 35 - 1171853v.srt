00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,000
[Episode 35]

4
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:37,340
After the summit,

5
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,120
you must come to my place to sit and chat.

6
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,380
I still have some good tea.

7
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:44,250
-  I just know how much you like drinking tea.  
 - CEO Zheng!

8
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:49,670
Hi, I'm Chen Yiming from Yiwen Culture. Chief Gong told me to wait here for you.

9
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:51,560
Oh, I know.

10
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,760
You are the influencer of the Wemedia Lao Gong told me about. You want me to run ads on your platform.

11
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,760
Right.

12
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,680
Please take a look. This is our company's profile.

13
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,740
How many followers do you have now?

14
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:07,490
Our company just started, so only 60,000 followers.

15
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:09,470
60,000?

16
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,600
You want me to give you an ad with just 60,000?

17
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,120
You think too naively.

18
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:23,590
How about this? Once you have over a million followers, come talk to me.

19
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:25,180
CEO Zheng, I—

20
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,500
Nowadays, some people

21
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:34,370
really don't know how much they're worth yet go promote themselves everywhere.

22
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:37,520
This is the so-called "have an exaggerated opinion of his own abilities."

23
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:45,320
- Hello? 
 - Hello, Mr Chen. I'm the legal counsel at the bank.

24
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:49,600
Your mortgage is already six months overdue. We have already filed a litigation with the court.

25
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,880
I don't have money!

26
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,910
Just take my house! Just have the court sentence me to death!

27
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,190
Oh!

28
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:14,490
President Wang, did you look at the materials I gave you last time?

29
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:17,270
What do you think? How about a collaboration?

30
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,890
What's your company's value right now?

31
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:23,310
¥200-¥300 million!

32
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:26,320
Just ¥200-¥300 million and you want to collaborate with me?

33
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,630
You think too naively!

34
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,830
Once you're worth ¥10 billion then let's talk.

35
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:38,400
Nowadays, some people really don't know how much they're worth yet go promote themselves everywhere.

36
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,730
Forget it, let's go.

37
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,630
This is money's arrogance.

38
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,420
Mr. Yiming,

39
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:53,240
I'm your loyal follower. I look at your content every day.

40
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,140
When will I get the opportunity to collaborate with you?

41
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:04,030
Exuse me, President Wang. There is something happening with the organizing committee that needs your assistance.

42
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,200
I'm going inside now.

43
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,240
About the collaboration, I'll have my secretary—

44
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,660
President Wang, this way, please.

45
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:38,830
- Hello? 
 - Hello, Mr. Chen.

46
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,340
Sorry about that earlier.

47
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,390
Sorry about that Mr. Chen. I'm very sorry.

48
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:45,860
The bank called me just now. All of your debt has been paid off.

49
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,050
Who helped me pay if off?

50
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:49,390
Did you not pay them off yourself?

51
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,180
Mr. Chen? Mr. Chen?

52
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:01,150
Yiming!

53
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:07,230
- Yiming! 
 - President Wang!

54
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:09,590
Can you give me some face?

55
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:11,730
Face?

56
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:14,040
You helped pay off my mortgage, right?

57
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,310
Also, the replies, they were from you, right?

58
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,470
President Wang,

59
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:22,180
I don't need your help.

60
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,190
I also don't need your sympathy.

61
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,740
And I definitely don't need your pity.

62
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,510
President Wang, I beg you.

63
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:34,370
Can you please let me have some self-respect?

64
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:38,080
Don't worry, I'll repay everything that you've helped me with.

65
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,980
Just give me some time.

66
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,640
Yiming!

67
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:52,750
The only thing you can repay me with is probably money, right?

68
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:57,390
I also put out a lot of care,

69
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:01,980
worries, respect, appreciation,

70
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,380
and love. How would you return those to me?

71
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,810
You said you have your self-respect and face,

72
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,620
but does that mean that I don't have self-respect or face to keep?

73
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,440
I used all my courage to tell you how I felt.

74
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,920
In return, you left without a word.

75
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:31,860
I quietly got close to you and cared for you.

76
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,220
In return, you just say that you don't need it.

77
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:40,010
Chen Yiming, I'm also a person.

78
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:42,360
I also feel sad when I get rejected!

79
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,370
When I'm humiliated, I also feel sad! My heart also bleeds!

80
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:53,100
I also have pride and a sense of inferiority.

81
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:56,890
But with you, I put all my guard down.

82
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:59,460
Including all my weaknesses.

83
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:09,020
I just wish that you are well and happy.

84
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:11,330
Did I do something wrong?

85
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,180
Yiming,

86
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:24,510
I don't blame you.

87
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,960
It is I who put myself in such a low position.

88
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,610
It is I who gave you the right to hurt me.

89
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,270
I will disappear.

90
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,960
Disappear from your life.

91
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,500
I won't bother you ever again.

92
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:21,450
If it were me, I would respect what my heart's desire is.

93
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,360
From an economic perspective,

94
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,540
people socially interact just for gains.

95
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:32,150
That means that the relationships between people are all based on personal gains.

96
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:34,600
Romantic relationships are also based on personal gains.

97
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,810
Surviving in the workplace is quite easy, actually.

98
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:42,120
Whatever position you're in, you do what you have to do.

99
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:46,550
Don't disappoint yourself or the company.

100
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:32,950
Sister Ziru, when are you free? Let's catch up.

101
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,810
 [All Day Brunch Bistro]

102
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,920
[5:00 p.m. tomorrow.]

103
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,510
[OK.]

104
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,600
Welcome.

105
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,100
Please take care.

106
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,800
Long time no see.

107
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:12,840
Your complexion does not look very good.

108
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:15,380
What would you like to drink?

109
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,300
How about lemon water?

110
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:22,200
Waitress, please give us a glass of lemon water.

111
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,200
- Okay. 
 - Thank you.

112
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,690
- Please enjoy. 
 - Thank you.

113
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:41,000
I remember when I introduced you to GM Pan back then,

114
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,300
the two of you spoke quite congenially.

115
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,400
Yes.

116
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,300
Then, why is the situation like this now?

117
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,200
You heard?

118
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,800
Sister Ziru,

119
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:04,200
GM Pan's temper is a bit big and a bit agitated,

120
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,200
but his character, core, and skills

121
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,600
are the best out of all the entrepreneurs that I have ever encountered.

122
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:15,600
Sometimes he's careless and isn't willing to get restricted by rules,

123
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,000
but he does all these not for himself.

124
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,800
Rather, it's for the growth of Lubao.

125
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,500
It's his patriotism.

126
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,600
You are right. I do admire him,

127
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,400
but...

128
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:33,900
that doesn't mean that he is the best pick for Lubao's chairman.

129
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,800
Then, who do you think would be better suited than him?

130
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,100
Me.

131
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:46,000
You don't understand batteries or new energy at all!

132
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,100
I know how to make money with Lubao though.

133
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:56,620
In your eyes, is Lubao just a tool to make money?

134
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,000
Yes.

135
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,600
Back then, you became friends with me

136
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,400
was actually because of Lubao.

137
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:13,760
Yes.

138
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,000
At the time, I was looking at the new energy industry,

139
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,100
and your appearance just so happened to give me an opportunity.

140
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:27,780
From me, you found out that Lubao was doing equity financing.

141
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,400
From my lips, you also got

142
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,400
information on Hua'an and Shanghai Bank.

143
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,800
When I was no longer useful to you,

144
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,600
you betrayed me

145
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,000
to prove your alliance with Fang Zhan.

146
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,800
I must correct you there.

147
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,400
I gained Fang Zhan's trust.

148
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,200
I always thought of you as a friend.

149
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,800
I also thought of you as a friend.

150
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,100
You were using me!

151
00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:01,200
Siyu, you also gained a lot from me.

152
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,300
I even saved you ¥300,000 worth of car repairs.

153
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:08,000
I'm also the one who gave your ex-boyfriend a job.

154
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I'm so stupid.

155
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,600
I didn't see through you.

156
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:20,200
I even recommended you to GM Pan.

157
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,000
It wasn't me who you couldn't see through,

158
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,700
it's life itself.

159
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,600
As an adult, you should know

160
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,600
that behind every slab of meat, there is a price written down.

161
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,000
It was I who caused GM Pan's downfall.

162
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,200
I sabotaged Lubao.

163
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,400
Don't put it all on yourself.

164
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:45,200
Lubao will only be more worthy in my hands.

165
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,400
President Pan may not be the president anymore, but he's still

166
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,000
a shareholder. He's going to gain profit.

167
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,600
Even more than what he's gained from the past 10 years.

168
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,500
Do you think money is everything?

169
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,200
I work with investments.

170
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,200
Money, to me, is everything.

171
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,000
If that's how it is,

172
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,300
then your life must be so tedious.

173
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,200
Because besides money,

174
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,800
there are a lot of things that are valuable.

175
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,400
Siyu, my life

176
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:19,000
is much more exciting than you imagined.

177
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,700
No.

178
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,590
You just keep learning from experience then.

179
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,600
My boyfriend is here to pick me up.

180
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,600
Sorry. I'll be leaving.

181
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,600
Take care.

182
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,400
I'm here!

183
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,200
How's that possible?

184
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,000
I'm sure!

185
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,400
No, you must have mistaken it.

186
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,000
Chen Yiming told me so himself.

187
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,500
Then he definitely lied to you.

188
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,400
We are business partners right now.

189
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,300
He wouldn't lie to me.

190
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,300
But if he does this, how can he face Li Siyu?

191
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,200
Please! They broke up months ago.

192
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:52,300
But Li Siyu hasn't forgotten about him; she's still thinking of getting back together with him.

193
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,200
How do you know that?

194
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,200
Li Siyu lives in the same house as me.

195
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:01,200
How can I not know?

196
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,000
Well, it's really not Yiming's fault.

197
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:18,200
Chen Yiming definitely with that old woman for money.

198
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,600
I can't allow you to say that about my brother.

199
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,200
I said it.

200
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:28,000
Chen Yiming is a vain and greedy gigolo.

201
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,000
If anyone else said the words that you just said,

202
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,600
then it wouldn't be a problem.

203
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:36,400
But coming out of your mouth, I don't understand.

204
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,100
What do you mean?

205
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,800
Aren't you the one who wants to marry a rich guy?

206
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,400
Chen Yiming has attained that dream on your behalf,

207
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,000
so you should be applauding him.

208
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,400
You should think of him as an idol.

209
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:55,000
Also, are you scolding yourself or Chen Yiming?

210
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,200
Moreover, Chen Yiming is not a gigolo.

211
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,200
The commercials that Wang Ziru offered us were all rejected by him.

212
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,000
He still relies on me for food.

213
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,200
How come you're leaving after only eating half a meal?

214
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,300
I'm too angry!

215
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,400
Today's article was very blunt.

216
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,310
The content must be blunt if I want to be in the top ten trending posts.

217
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,290
What are you writing tomorrow?

218
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:33,080
I'm writing about Lubao's contests of equities.

219
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:39,840
Okay. What side are you on?

220
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:44,840
As a bystander, I must remain neutral, of course.

221
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,500
I look forward to reading it.

222
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:54,130
Can I interview you for a bit?

223
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,600
Okay.

224
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,400
Since you've worked with Pan Zhiyou for a while now,

225
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,600
what do you think of him?

226
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:10,100
Pan Zhiyong is idealistic and has strong emotions,

227
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,400
but the market doesn't trust feelings and ideals.

228
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:17,600
The market trusts the law, power, and rules.

229
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,800
I also heard that before he left Lubao, he said some ruthless words.

230
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,400
He said something like..

231
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,800
"You group of savages. We'll see how long you can stay happy."

232
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,600
Yes. Acquirers are usually viewed as wolves.

233
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,200
It's because we prioritize returns.

234
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,600
Due to that goal, people who hinder the company's development

235
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,600
or staff who hang around and have achieved nothing,

236
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,200
we will definitely heartlessly fire them.

237
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,800
So,

238
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,800
people are annoyed and hate us

239
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,400
but the market will improve due to us.

240
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,800
However, from Lubao's history of development,

241
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:00,400
Pan Zhiyong is indeed a very outstanding leader.

242
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,800
He is not the most outstanding though.

243
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,200
Then, who do you think is the most outstanding?

244
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,900
You.

245
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,000
Yiming.

246
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Are you really not going to come back and help me?

247
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,700
Do you know why I chose to leave Tianye?

248
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,800
I do.

249
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,100
I scared you.

250
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,900
No.

251
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:49,700
I... At that time, I had just gone through a breakup.

252
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,800
My mind really was a mess,

253
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,400
so I needed time and space

254
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,400
to peacefully figure out

255
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:00,490
exactly what my situation was.

256
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,000
I understand.

257
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,800
So, at that time,

258
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:10,900
no matter what, I had to leave Tianye.

259
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:21,000
Yiming, you have never relied on me before.

260
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,000
I want to keep it that way now.

261
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:31,800
No problem. I will listen to you.

262
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,770
I'm back!

263
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:11,960
Today was so tiring!

264
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,220
You came back so early today.

265
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,720
Yeah.

266
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:49,250
Siyu,

267
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:55,420
- there's something... 
- I already know.

268
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,370
H-How do you know?

269
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:02,840
I saw it with my own eyes.

270
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,470
Siyu, listen to me.

271
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:07,910
It's fine.

272
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:12,910
The two of us broke up long ago. Who he is with has nothing to do with me.

273
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:14,990
Yes, that's right.

274
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:24,650
Are you okay?

275
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:29,120
How could I not be? Isn't it just a man?

276
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,930
- Yes! 
 - We'll just find another.

277
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:32,710
Yes, we'll find two.

278
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:34,400
No. We'll find a bunch of men.

279
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,350
More handsome than him!

280
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:37,950
- Better than him! 
 - More talented than him!

281
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,100
Yet I still want him.

282
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:01,740
Siyu,

283
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,080
if you want to cry, then go ahead.

284
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,420
I'm not going to cry.

285
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,950
There's nothing to cry about.

286
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,050
I have a career.

287
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:18,010
How do I have time to be distracted by this kind of thing?

288
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:19,510
Yes.

289
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,110
Hello, Director Zhang.

290
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:41,080
I want to ask about what your final thoughts are on investing in Laidianle.

291
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,850
Okay, okay.

292
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:51,920
Then... when we have good projects, I'll introduce them to you.

293
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,540
Okay.

294
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,380
He...

295
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:12,400
He isn't willing to invest.

296
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,820
He doesn't have good taste.

297
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:18,240
He isn't willing to invest.

298
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,900
He will regret it for sure!

299
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,730
He isn't willing to invest!

300
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:30,220
He isn't willing to invest!

301
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,600
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

302
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,250
He isn't willing to invest!

303
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:35,770
You'll feel better once you cry it out.

304
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:38,590
♫  The wishes that I made ♫

305
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:40,690
Don't worry, it's fine.

306
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,430
♫ Realize ♫

307
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:47,230
It's fine.

308
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:54,670
♫  Nights are filled with loneliness  ♫

309
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:56,510
♫  Lights are dimming  ♫

310
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:57,940
Just cry.

311
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:00,380
♫  yet I'm awake  ♫

312
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,080
It's fine.

313
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,730
♫  Love and bittersweet joys  ♫

314
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,870
♫  Regrets  ♫

315
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:17,190
♫  You were by my side  ♫

316
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:19,150
Oh, right.

317
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:20,740
I have something to talk to you about.

318
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:21,840
Yes?

319
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,780
I have been paying attention to Laidianle.

320
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:29,110
Considering its merits, I think Lubao can continue investing in it.

321
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:31,870
No.

322
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,510
Why?

323
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,500
There are two ways to start a business.

324
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:42,410
One way is to quick financing, spending, and expansion in order to occupy the whole market immediately.

325
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:44,830
The other is to steadily work and fight.

326
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:48,490
Earn profit by steadily running the business and then expand slowly.

327
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:52,240
Li Siyu, in the start, was hovering between the two,

328
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:57,050
causing her to be in this dilemma now where she cannot continue with either way.

329
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,780
Is there any way to turn things around then?

330
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,600
It's too late.

331
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:09,190
Competitors have already appeared in the market. Also, their momentum is better than hers.

332
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:12,240
She has already missed the best time for expansion.

333
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:15,660
Even if Pan Zhiyong was still the president,

334
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:20,870
Lubao's Board of Directors would not support the investment into Laidianle, right?

335
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,600
Then that's really a shame.

336
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,780
It's not a shame.

337
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:32,570
Li Siyu is a good salesperson.

338
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:36,510
Bbut when it comes to digital marketing and financing, she's like a blank piece of paper.

339
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:41,170
Also, Pan Zhiying is very self-willed and self-conceited,

340
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:43,640
he wouldn't listen to the opinions of others.

341
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:48,850
The two of them collaborating was bound to fail.

342
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,240
Do you still miss her?

343
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:06,280
I just don't want... don't want to see her in such a difficult situation.

344
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:10,200
Yiming,

345
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:14,370
in every other aspect, I'm pretty generous;

346
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:18,440
but when it comes to relationships, I'm petty.

347
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:23,690
I don't want you to always bring her up.

348
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,820
I don't want you to always miss her.

349
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,490
Okay?

350
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:58,620
I really can't believe that Wang Ziru is that kind of a person.

351
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,150
Now that I think about it, when she got close to me in the beginning,

352
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:08,000
she was not only targeting Lubao,

353
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,150
but also Chen Yiming.

354
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:13,620
You can't just let this go then!

355
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:15,830
What do you want?

356
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:19,860
You have to at least let Chen Yiming know what that old woman is truly like.

357
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:22,880
Xiaoling,

358
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:28,160
we broke up because of our problems.

359
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,920
It had nothing to do with other people.

360
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:34,090
That Wang Ziru treated you like that, are you really able to just let it go?

361
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:35,490
I can't.

362
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:39,330
Then we need to find a way to vent that anger out!

363
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:41,800
Do you know what it means to vent anger?

364
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:48,140
Yelling at her, hitting her, or even stabbing her a few times;

365
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:52,130
but trust me, these things won't dissipate my anger.

366
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:55,790
The only way I can dissipate my anger is by

367
00:29:55,790 --> 00:30:00,490
steadily making Laidianle big, powerful, and going public.

368
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:02,380
Will you be able to do it?

369
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:06,570
I must do it.

370
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,260
All right.

371
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:15,260
You can come and take a look around at our company.

372
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:17,720
I can show you all the data on my site's back end.

373
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:21,660
Once you see it, you will know that this project is definitely promising!

374
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:28,810
Okay.

375
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:31,010
Let's keep in touch.

376
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:19,010
Come in!

377
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,780
Sister,

378
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:31,830
I heard that Lubao is not going to invest in us anymore.

379
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:35,690
Lubao has encountered some problems of their own.

380
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:37,440
Then is Laidianle over?

381
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,170
No way.

382
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:42,270
- But we— 
 - I have other ways to get funding.

383
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:46,550
Really?

384
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:49,560
Go back to work.

385
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:04,060
Sister,

386
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:08,870
no matter if it's to live or to die, I will stand by you.

387
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,470
I will definitely not die.

388
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,860
[Wechat Picture] 
 [The 1 file has been successfully trashed.]

389
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,100
- President Li. 
 - I know.

390
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,100
- Then...? 
 - Trust me, I have a plan.

391
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,600
President Li!

392
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,800
Lao Bai handed in her resignation just now.

393
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,200
I know.

394
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,400
Five staff members have already left this month.

395
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,400
It's fine. We can recruit ten more.

396
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,800
President Li, I think the problem is not with recruitment.

397
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:08,200
Everyone is panicky now. There are many rumors about

398
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,200
the company's future.

399
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:25,000
Everyone, come here!

400
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,600
Drop your work for a moment and come over here!

401
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:35,750
Hurry!

402
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:42,000
I want to officially tell everyone.

403
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,200
First, we have already resolved the trivial issue

404
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,700
regarding finances. The company has returned to normal now.

405
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:55,200
Second, since the company started,

406
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,000
it's always been a company that keeps creating miracles.

407
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,200
What do we rely on to make miracles happen?

408
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,000
Do we rely on the market? On funds?

409
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
No.

410
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,200
What we rely on is our belief that not only can we through hardship,

411
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,400
but we can also get past the self-blame, weakness, hesitation, and suspicion in our hearts.

412
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,200
We will definitely win!

413
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:17,200
We will definitely be able to smile till the end!

414
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,200
Seek perfection! Seek excellence!

415
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,400
That's right. Together, we will

416
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:32,400
seek perfection! Seek excellence!

417
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:43,840
Chen Yiming,

418
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,000
do you think that I don't have a heart?

419
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,800
That I will gracefully allow you to stand in front of me?

420
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,800
Let me finish.

421
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,800
I didn't kick you out

422
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,600
because I'm not willing to let my employees see me be a bitch.

423
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,800
Please listen to what I have to say.

424
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,700
I feel very disgusted already.

425
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:02,400
Don't eliminate the last bit of good feelings

426
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,400
between us.

427
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,400
I didn't come to discuss our relationship.

428
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,800
Do we still have a relationship?

429
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,800
I came here today,

430
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:22,300
to persuade you to close Laidianle.

431
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:29,800
Are you saying this with your identity as Lubao's current GM's

432
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,800
boyfriend?

433
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,000
The relationship between Sister Ziru and I is a personal matter.

434
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,200
I don't want to explain it.

435
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,600
I came here today for your sake.

436
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,400
I can't believe you just said that.

437
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,200
Are you not disgusted?

438
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,400
If you really want to succeed,

439
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:07,300
you must understand how to choose and learn to let go.

440
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:15,400
When you first started the business, I was watching.

441
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:22,200
You focused on the product and was very careful.

442
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,400
However, you suddenly started to speed up.

443
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,000
Afterward, perhaps because your funds were disappearing, you started to hold back.

444
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,200
Now, you have no guidelines at all.

445
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,500
Don't think that just because you work in Wemedia, you know everything!

446
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,800
Okay.

447
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,600
Let me talk about marketing planning something I understand very well.

448
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,000
Nowadays, for a startup

449
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
to promote an app without burning money, is very difficult.

450
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,800
If you have a unique creation and a clear selling point,

451
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,800
then it's not impossible. Did you have that though?

452
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,000
Let's talk about your flyer.

453
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,200
What's the difference between this and a shopping mall's DM flyer? 
 (TN: direct mail flyers)

454
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,800
Let's talk about your marketing highlights.

455
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,000
Do you bring convenience to the scooter users?

456
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,200
Or bring franchisees business?

457
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,000
You may think that both are your highlights.

458
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,800
But when it comes to promotions, you must have a key point.

459
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,900
Even if I have mistakes, it's not late for me to correct them.

460
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,400
You've already run out of resources.

461
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:31,200
All entrepreneurs experience the darkness before dawn.

462
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,800
As long as we get past it, there is light.

463
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:39,000
This is not the darkness before dawn, this is a pit of mud where you fall further and further into.

464
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,600
What gives you the right to say that?

465
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,600
In regards to the current situation of Laidianle,

466
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:47,800
I believe that you are clearer than me.

467
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,030
Are you here to see me make a fool of myself?

468
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:16,000
Leaving already? No need to go in such a hurry.

469
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,100
I want you to witness a big life event of mine.

470
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,300
Guan Xiaotang, what are you doing?

471
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,700
Sister President Li,

472
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:30,390
right now,

473
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,200
it is the 193451st minute since I have met you.

474
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,200
This number doesn't mean anything.

475
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:40,100
But what I'm want to say today means a lot.

476
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,000
Sister President Li,

477
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,400
you're the coolest girl I've ever met.

478
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,000
I'm willing to let you kick my ass for the rest of my life.

479
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:52,400
Aside from having a blind ex-boyfriend, you don't have any other flaws.

480
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,000
I love you.

481
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:05,300
Let's go! Let's go!

482
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:09,200
Sister President Li,  I have a level 200 mystical beast, a Water-Dragon.

483
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,200
- Wow! Level 200! 
 - I decided to give it to you.

484
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,500
What is it?

485
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:20,400
This is my username and password. Please accept it.

486
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,700
Stop messing around. Get up!

487
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,600
If you don't accept it, I'm not getting up.

488
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:36,000
Accept it! Accept it! Accept it!

489
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:43,700
Fine. I'll accept it.

490
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,600
Sorry.

491
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,800
 Xiao Tang treat us to a meal! 

492
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,400
It's 1:00 a.m., what are you doing out here not sleeping?

493
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,000
You are not afraid that your face will become loose?

494
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:53,760
In third grade,

495
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:56,850
I got third place for an exam.

496
00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:00,550
My mom hit me brutally

497
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,400
as if I had gotten last place or something.

498
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,800
What a terrible childhood.

499
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:11,400
Later on, you came to our home.

500
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,200
I discovered that for every exam,

501
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:19,500
if you weren't last, then you were second to last.

502
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,600
But your mom never hit you.

503
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,800
She didn't even yell at you.

504
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:29,000
During that time, I thought,

505
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,200
how is it that mothers could be so different?

506
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,400
It's not that your mom is different from my mom,

507
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:38,000
it's that you and I are different.

508
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,800
You were good at studying so your mom required you to get first place for every exam.

509
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,400
I was not.

510
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,600
My mom was used to it. She accepted it.

511
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,700
We are actually the same.

512
00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:58,770
It's the middle of the night, are you going to sleep or not?

513
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,800
If you're not going to sleep, I'm going to sleep.

514
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:06,200

529
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:16,800
♫  Yet I've never thought of letting you go  ♫

530
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,200
♫  Yeah...  ♫

531
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:23,800
♫ Oh... ♫

532
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:24,800
♫ En... ♫

533
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,600
♫ En... ♫

534
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:30,000
♫  Dear Myself  ♫

535
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
♫  Listen to the voice inside  ♫

536
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,200
♫  In this lonely world, be cautious  ♫

537
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,600
♫  After we're hurt, we learn to cherish  ♫

538
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:42,800
♫  Dear Myself  ♫

539
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:46,200
♫  Use all your strength  ♫

540
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:50,400
♫  Missing the simple you from the past  ♫

541
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,400
♫  Turn difficulties into courage  ♫

542
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:57,400
♫  Don't back down from the crowd  ♫

543
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,400
♫  Growth is inevitably accompanied by setbacks  ♫

544
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:02,400
♫  The best way to overcome difficulties is to smile  ♫

545
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,600
♫  Are you afraid of all the punishment given by fate?  ♫

546
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:06,800
♫  Let everything go, all those concerns, real or fake  ♫

547
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:10,000
♫  Cannot erase the scar, but it's just a scar  ♫

548
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,600
♫  We are so small yet so determined  ♫

549
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,200
♫  Occasionally fussy and occasionally firm  ♫

550
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,000
♫  If growth leaves a trace, then the trace is left be tears  ♫

551
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,400
♫  Your back that I've always been chasing  ♫

552
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,600
♫  Finally turned around to hug me tightly  ♫

553
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:25,400
♫  It's still that familiar you  ♫

554
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:28,600
♫  Yeah...  ♫

555
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:32,200
♫ Oh... ♫

556
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
♫  Dear Myself  ♫

557
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,600
♫  Listen to the voice inside  ♫

558
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:45,600
♫  I'll give you the warmth that the wind took  ♫

559
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:47,800
♫  Hugging you, hugging me  ♫

560
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:51,200
♫  Dear Myself  ♫

561
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:55,200
♫  The sky has finally cleared  ♫

562
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:58,400
♫  We've never been so clear-headed  ♫

563
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,600
♫  Looking for the past me who  ♫

564
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:04,200
♫  Ran forward without evading anything  ♫

565
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:07,400
♫  Ran forward without evading anything  ♫

566
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:10,800
♫  Listen to the voice inside  ♫

567
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,800
♫  The sky has finally cleared  ♫
