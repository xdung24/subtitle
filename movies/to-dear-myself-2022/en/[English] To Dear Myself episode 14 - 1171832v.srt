00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,970
[Episode 14]

4
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,760
Today, I ate so happily today.

5
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:49,530
Exactly! The most important thing as a person is happiness!

6
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:53,470
Besides happiness, you also need money!

7
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:55,540
Happy, happy.

8
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,510
Xiaoling,

9
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:01,090
can I consult you about something?

10
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:03,090
What thing?

11
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,720
Be my girlfriend.

12
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,590
I promise you,

13
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:12,830
I'll be super successful in the future.

14
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:21,570
Okay?

15
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:28,540
Lei Haowen, I see you as a brother.

16
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,760
I can't believe...

17
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,610
I can't believe you think of me that way.

18
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,290
Miss, it's not like that.

19
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:41,920
What way do I think of you?

20
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,360
But I don't want to just be your brother.

21
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,680
Then don't be my anything.

22
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,980
Is there no room for negotiation?

23
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,690
We could also be best friends.

24
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:03,950
Fine. We will be best friends.

25
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,360
Hey, slow down.

26
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,260
- My shoes. 
 - One, two.

27
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,130
Two. One, two.

28
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:21,630
One, two.

29
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,810
Okay.

30
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,050
One, two.

31
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,300
Two.

32
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,750
One, two.

33
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:35,770
I'm sorry. Let's take a break.

34
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,580
When did you get here?

35
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,120
Just got here.

36
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:06,740
Didn't you go out to eat with GM Wang?

37
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:16,150
We just finished.

38
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:21,940
Today, Sister Ziru said some things that confused me deeply,

39
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:26,000
but Sister Ziru said something else,

40
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,670
that really encouraged me.

41
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:30,370
So I came to find you.

42
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,040
Is that so?

43
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:36,090
Yiming,

44
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,950
I'm not leaving Shanghai.

45
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,720
Why?

46
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,990
First:

47
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,750
my competition with Sister Yuan isn't finished yet.

48
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:54,600
Second: even if I lost the competition and got kicked out of Lubao,

49
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,510
I still wouldn't want to leave Shanghai.

50
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:06,050
Yiming, don't leave either.

51
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:08,990
We can fight together.

52
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,880
I'm going to go change.

53
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:07,820
There's a traffic jam.

54
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,190
There are traffic jams all over this city.

55
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:14,830
The house prices are high, the living cost is high.

56
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:19,190
If we can't save money, then the air quality is also bad.

57
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:23,800
You forgot one more thing. Here, success is hard.

58
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,980
But failure is easy.

59
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,450
But there are opportunities here.

60
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,220
Siyu,

61
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:38,290
there's a ready opportunity right in front of me.

62
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:45,370
In the past, when we worked so hard on studying and entering college,

63
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:48,410
and forced ourselves to get into good colleges,

64
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:53,770
wasn't that so that we could find a developed place and see the world?

65
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:58,760
We've only just recently gotten some small achievements, why do you suddenly want to go back?

66
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:05,700
These small achievements might matter to us, the things we've gotten,

67
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:09,560
in this city, mean nothing.

68
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:13,690
We've worked hard for seven years, the money we've saved,

69
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:16,550
the statuses we saved, and the resources we've saved

70
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:18,930
all got used up so fast.

71
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:22,910
Yiming, all of these things you're facing right now are temporary.

72
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,810
It'll all pass over.

73
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:28,110
The only things that are temporary are our feeling of success from the past.

74
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,230
If you think our ways of living are a problem,

75
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:40,130
then we can choose not to buy a house right now.

76
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:44,650
Our income is enough to stay and live in Shanghai.

77
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:48,240
Siyu,

78
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:52,900
it's not that I can't live in Shanghai.

79
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:57,040
I just don't have confidence in this city.

80
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,800
If I stay here,

81
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,710
I worry that I'll lose every last bit of self-dignity I have.

82
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:06,560
It couldn't be that bad.

83
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:10,700
Do you know why I didn't go work for President Guo?

84
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:17,230
It's because I'm petty, I'm narrow-minded.

85
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,660
I kept doubting for no reason,

86
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:22,130
how we could have turned out like this.

87
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:25,060
Because I feel inferior.

88
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,540
And I'm scared of losing you.

89
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:34,940
I really hate... I really loathe resigning like this.

90
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:38,450
But if I stay in Shanghai,

91
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:42,730
I know I will become like that.

92
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,200
But if it's like that,

93
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:56,410
then we'll have to be in a long-distance relationship.

94
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:03,770
Yiming, stay.

95
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:10,600
Siyu,

96
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:14,090
leave with me.

97
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,600
The car is here.

98
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,400
I'll take you.

99
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:41,050
♫  Like a small steady stream  ♫

100
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:50,070
♫  Keep thinking that we still have time  ♫

101
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,800
It's this one.

102
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,280
Here.

103
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:59,020
♫  The days have yet to come  ♫

104
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,560
- Is this the car you called? 
 - Yes.

105
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:07,840
Please drive slowly. Be careful.

106
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:12,450
♫  Getting through long nights  ♫

107
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:17,130
♫  Never hesitating  ♫

108
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:26,520
♫  We want to escape, far away from home  ♫

109
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:35,800
♫  But is as lost as others  ♫

110
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:39,670
 Yiming, stay. 

111
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,200
 Siyu, 

112
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,390
 leave with me. 

113
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:54,670
♫  Never giving each other the chance to breathe  ♫

114
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:02,540
♫  Thought that being loved by you  ♫

115
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:08,110
♫  Thought that we wouldn't age  ♫

116
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:12,640
♫  Wouldn't separate  ♫

117
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:21,700
♫  Yet as I was walking, I lost you  ♫

118
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:31,150
♫  The memories won't let me escape  ♫

119
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:39,970
♫  As I was walking, I lost you  ♫

120
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:48,930
♫  The memories won't let me escape  ♫

121
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,200
- Hi, Sister Siyu 
 - Good morning.

122
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,200
Lili.

123
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,600
- Sister Siyu. 
 - Where are the rest of them?

124
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,200
They said...

125
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,600
that our group lost. They were scared you wouldn't come.

126
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,000
So they gave themselves a break.

127
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,200
Then, why didn't you go on break?

128
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,500
I knew you wouldn't give up that easily.

129
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,600
Notify all of them. We're having a meeting immediately.

130
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,000
Okay.

131
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,580
The demon has returned. Hurry, everyone, let's have a meeting.

132
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,800
Liu Xiaojia, do you think that

133
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,800
because we've lost, you can give yourself a break?

134
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,400
You aren't contacting the clients anymore,

135
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,800
you've stopped calling, and you've stopped chasing contracts.

136
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,200
It wasn't like that.

137
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,600
I'm telling you.

138
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,600
Even if we admit defeat, it will be after the three month period is over.

139
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,500
If the time isn't up, then we still have a chance.

140
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,800
- But— 
 - But what?

141
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,600
You think that just because they're beating us by 20 million,

142
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,400
we won't be able to catch up no matter how hard we try. Right?

143
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,400
Yes. I also don't think we'll be able to catch up.

144
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,800
But even if we can't catch up we should still try.

145
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,400
We can lose this battle, but we can't lose the war!

146
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,000
Yes, we have to endure it and not give up.

147
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,200
Are you enduring it? Have you not given up yet?

148
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,600
I have been.

149
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,200
Are you under the impression that making 30 calls a day counts as persevering?

150
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,100
I'm telling you.

151
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:34,200
Today you make 30 calls, tomorrow 35, and the day after that 40. That's what counts as persevering.

152
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,480
Everyone, get in better spirits!

153
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,400
Sister Siyu, don't worry!

154
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,600
We will all improve!

155
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,000
Fighting! Fighting! Fighting!

156
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,600
Sister Siyu, come out for a second.

157
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:59,100
Yuan Huizhong has been colluding with people in and outside of the business.

158
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,900
They've tricked the company out of more than five million batteries.

159
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:05,300
That can't be. Who in the company?

160
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:08,000
I've heard it was called... Meiyi Group

161
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Meiyin Group?

162
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
GM Pan got the Legal Department to investigate that company,

163
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,800
and he said that the business license, their office, their official site,

164
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,800
and their news links are all fake.

165
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,400
What?

166
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:25,000
That four million is my fault. I am willing to accept any punishment that the company gives me,

167
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,200
but I really didn't collude with those people.

168
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,800
Then why did you, in front of me and Pan Zhiyong,

169
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,900
admit that you knew them?

170
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,400
I- I was just saying that.

171
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:42,200
I trusted your word. I even came up with evidence to help you.

172
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:46,400
The Legal Department has already reported this, and the police department has also started its investigation.

173
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,200
I've been to Meiyin Group before,

174
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,400
and I've met the director of their office.

175
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,300
Were you tricked, too?

176
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,600
They had originally contacted Lin Ling,

177
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,300
- but Sister Yuan stole the order. 
 - She deserved it then.

178
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:03,200
- Sister Yuan is also a victim. 
 - No, she's not!

179
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,800
I heard that she's known that group of con artists for many years.

180
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,200
That's the reason why we suspect her of being in on it.

181
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,800
No. Sister Yuan really doesn't know them.

182
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,600
Liu Jie can testify for me.

183
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,000
On the day of the signing, it was also my first time ever meeting those con artists.

184
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,900
Liu Jie is on your side. How could anyone believe what she said?

185
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,200
Li Siyu and Lin Ling were also there.

186
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:32,600
They... Would they really help you?

187
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,600
Hey! What are you doing?

188
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,800
I'm going to find GM Pan and tell him what's really going on.

189
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,200
You're helping her? Don't you remember how she treated you?

190
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,800
But she truly did nothing wrong.

191
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,600
She's wronged you so many times.

192
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,600
Don't be stupid. The company has rules.

193
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,600
If she really was tricked,

194
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,800
then four million, even if it was forty million, would no longer matter,

195
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:00,400
but if she really did collude with them, then she will be fired.

196
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,600
But Sister Yuan didn't collude with anyone.

197
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,600
All she did was make a mistake.

198
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,800
I heard that GM Pan is already convinced

199
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,000
that she and those con artists are working together.

200
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
He wants the Supervision Department to fire her.

201
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,000
Fang Zhan was staring at us the entire time.

202
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,200
They've fought multiple times.

203
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:27,000
If you stand up for her now, wouldn't you be creating a mess for GM Pan?

204
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,300
At the time, they were trying to steal my order, yet they somehow took a bad one?

205
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,800
What a reversal of heart.

206
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:42,000
Lin Ling, at the time, when you were with that Director Luo,

207
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,400
did you not notice anything out of place?

208
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,800
That Director Luo was quite strange.

209
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,800
How so?

210
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,300
He always vanished and liked to talk the big talk,

211
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:58,600
so after talking to him twice, Liu Jie gave up on him.

212
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,400
How did you discuss the contract with him?

213
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,400
He didn't really care about the price.

214
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,600
But his one condition was that after the deposit was paid, we needed to send him the entire supply of batteries.

215
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,700
Our work is quite tight,

216
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:18,400
so we don't want to stall every phase.

217
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,800
How about this, after sending you the deposit,

218
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:27,000
you will send me the supply. Within a month,

219
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,300
I'll give you the rest of the money. Is that okay?

220
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,820
This...

221
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,100
seems to be a little problematic.

222
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,200
I remember that earlier, there were two others. One was named

223
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:54,000
Li Siyu? Manager Li? I wonder if she would agree.

224
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Hey, Director Luo,

225
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,520
How about this?

226
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,100
You can pay a deposit of 20%

227
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,400
and I will agree with your payment methods.

228
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,400
However, I have a condition. You must sign the contract now.

229
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:19,200
Sure. Sure. No problem.

230
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,800
No wonder. The price Sister Yuan negotiated was quite good.

231
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:27,200
Sister Yuan definitely gave him an advantage on the way of shipment.

232
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,000
We're in so much danger.

233
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:37,190
Lin Ling, do you think

234
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:40,400
we should help Sister Yuan clear her name?

235
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,000
Clear her name on what?

236
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Right now, GM Pan is convinced

237
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
that Sister Yuan and Director Luo were working together.

238
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,400
However, we both know that before this, they didn't know each other.

239
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,200
Sister Siyu, if you want to help her, you can go.

240
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,300
- I'm not. 
 - Lin Ling.

241
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:05,500
Don't forget how they treated us before.

242
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,700
You should go back.

243
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,200
She brought it on herself.

244
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,400
- Were you looking for me? 
 - GM Pan.

245
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,000
I also had some things to say to you. Come in.

246
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,700
Here, sit.

247
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,400
You've heard about the things regarding Yuan Huizhong, right?

248
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,200
There have been rumors.

249
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,800
The company cannot tolerate her behavior, so the government program

250
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:43,900
and the management of the Sales Department have been all given to you.

251
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,800
- Me? 
 - Yes. You!

252
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:52,600
You need to prepare yourself ahead of time to take care of all of the work you will do in Sales.

253
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:58,400
GM Pan, how will the company punish Sister Yuan?

254
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:03,800
She let the company down to serve her own self-interest.

255
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:08,000
We must kick her out. No one will be able to get her out of it.

256
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
So you have to be ready to take over all the work.

257
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,150
Did you have something to tell me when you came?

258
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,750
No.

259
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,200
- Sister Siyu. 
 - Hi.

260
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,400
[Sales Department]

261
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,900
Come in.

262
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,900
Why are you closing the door?

263
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,300
- Sister Siyu. 
 - What?

264
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:12,000
I heard that you're officially being announced as Sales Director tomorrow.

265
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,100
- Who told you that? 
 - Everyone is talking about it!

266
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:18,600
Did you know, Sister, Kuai Zi, who always looked down on me, is now calling me Sister Jia?

267
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,300
- Isn't she older than you? 
 - Who cares? I'm her superior.

268
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,400
If they won, then she'd be my superior.

269
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:28,600
Also, Sister, Huang Bibo and the others are very worried

270
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,400
that you might fire them when you become Sales Director.

271
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,900
Zhang Siting, Sister You, they're both looking for new jobs.

272
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,900
- Why are they doing that? 
 - This time you won.

273
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:41,400
If they had won, then we'd have no food to eat, and no job.

274
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:46,400
Sister Siyu, should we celebrate a little early?

275
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,200
We still haven't won, what would we celebrate?

276
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,800
- Tell everyone. They need to stop spreading this. 
 - What?

277
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,000
Is there anything else?

278
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,800
Then I'll leave first.

279
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:33,900
Tomorrow morning, 10:00 a.m. The office will discuss your punishment.

280
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:38,200
Li Siyu and Ling Ling's testimonies are very important.

281
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,200
Li Siyu, you are just a poisonous snake who wanted revenge.

282
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,600
I'm going to be the sales director.

283
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,000
No, I'm going to be the sales director.

284
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,000
What else is there to think about?

285
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:51,000
Go to the Supervision Department or go find GM Pan.

286
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,500
Tell him what you know. Or you could go straight to Sister Yuan.

287
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:58,000
Tell her that you can prove that she doesn't know this liar.

288
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,900
If I do this, it doesn't benefit me.

289
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,400
But you should do this.

290
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,400
If I do this, then Sister Yuan can stay at the company.

291
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,000
As long as she stays in the company, she can represent Lubao and bid.

292
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,500
As long as she takes this bid, then she becomes the Sales Director!

293
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,400
Then what about me? I'll have to leave Lubao.

294
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,200
If you have to leave, then leave. What are you afraid of?

295
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,100
You can go to a different company.

296
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,630
You could also go to my hometown with me.

297
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:24,500
Zhu Xiaobai's company has a sales director position for you.

298
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:27,800
You just want me to leave Lubao and go to your hometown with you.

299
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,000
Li Siyu, do you really think of me as that kind of person?

300
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,800
Then why do you want me to dig a hole for myself?

301
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:41,610
Because this is the right thing to do.

302
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,000
It's not as simple as right and wrong.

303
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,200
I know that the situation is complicated,

304
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,200
but your choice is simple.

305
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,100
What do you mean simple?

306
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,800
This not only affects my future,

307
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,800
but it also affects my group members and GM Pan.

308
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,600
It even affects Lubao.

309
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,400
How about I put it like this?

310
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,800
Sister Yuan leaving will be good for everyone.

311
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:09,300
- Well, she shouldn't have to leave in this way. 
 - This is the way she would've wished for me to leave.

312
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:14,400
You should be the bigger person here.

313
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,600
That's you.

314
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:32,370
Sister Yuan's phone call.

315
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:40,500
You have to do this. You must.

316
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,400
I must.

317
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,700
Sister Yuan.

318
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,000
Everyone in the company has been talking,

319
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:58,700
saying that I have been connected with the con artist for a long time.

320
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:03,270
You said it yourself.

321
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:07,630
You know that it's not true.

322
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:18,700
Tomorrow, at 10:00 a.m., the company has arranged a meeting to discuss

323
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:21,000
whether or not I should be fired.

324
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,500
Siyu...

325
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,100
You need to help me tell the truth.

326
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,500
I can't be fired, not for this.

327
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,400
Siyu...

328
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,100
Please help me.

329
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,900
I can help you tell the truth,

330
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,800
but you need to tell me the truth as well.

331
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,500
What?

332
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,600
The government bidding project

333
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,800
was recorded by me first, not you.

334
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,600
I would help you with anything else, but not this.

335
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:16,100
Why? It was my performance originally.

336
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:20,400
Whoever gets this twenty-eight million will be able to win faster.

337
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,700
That might not be true.

338
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:31,300
All along, what you wanted wasn't the project.

339
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:39,700
It was the sales director position?

340
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,800
Think what you want.

341
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:50,200
I just want to take back what was mine originally.

342
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:59,590
I wanted you to testify for me because I wanted to stay at Lubao.

343
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,600
I wanted to stay at Lubao because I wanted to be the sales director.

344
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,500
Now that you use this as a condition,

345
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,100
do you think there would be any point in my staying at Lubao?

346
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,900
At least we would each do what was fair.

347
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,400
Let me tell you what "fair" means.

348
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:21,000
I worked so hard for Lubao and gave up so much for it. If I were the sales director, then it would be fair.

349
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,900
Then, what about justice for me?

350
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:26,100
You stole clients from me one after another, shouldn't I get justice as well?

351
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:28,400
You shouldn't have made me an enemy then.

352
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:32,000
You were the one who forced me into such a position.

353
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:46,000
Tomorrow, are you going to help me or not? If you do,

354
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,200
then I can forget about everything from the past.

355
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Give me the government bidding project back.

356
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:57,360
Li Siyu,

357
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:01,110
I'm going to ask you one more time.

358
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,900
Will you help me or not?

359
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:12,800
Give me the government bidding project back.

360
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:32,100
Did you finish discussing with Sister Yuan?

361
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,700
If you give that project to her,

362
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:53,600
then your chances of being the sales director are gone.

363
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:58,000
But after tomorrow, if I have to leave Lubao, then I'll lose even more opportunities.

364
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,100
Who said so? The results of tomorrow's meeting

365
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,500
are still not decided.

366
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:15,800
Senior Brother, it looks like I really can't stay at Lubao.

367
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,230
Trust me.

368
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:19,500
You have us.

369
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,300
Enter.

370
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,100
Sister Siyu, when are we leaving?

371
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:27,200
- How about 11:00? 
 - Sounds good.

372
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,600
- Hello? Sister Siyu? 
 - Zhizhi,

373
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,500
where is the meeting at 10:00 taking place?

374
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,700
Let me take a look.

375
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:50,000
10:00... The director's office.

376
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,900
I understand.

377
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,200
Are you really leaving?

378
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,400
Lin Ling, what's wrong?

379
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,100
What's wrong with her?

380
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:26,600
- I... I'm writing my resignation letter. 
 - You're doing perfectly fine right now.

381
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,700
Why would you resign?

382
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,500
Last night,

383
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:36,200
when I was working overtime, Director Fang approached me.

384
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:40,400
I'm sorry, I can't help Sister Yuan with this.

385
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,390
Lin Ling, I didn't ask you to lie.

386
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,200
I just want you to tell the truth.

387
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:56,200
If Yuan Huizhong is removed from the company because of this,

388
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,600
wouldn't your conscious hurt?

389
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:02,600
Director Fang, I'm on Sister Siyu's team.

390
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,200
Whatever I should say and do...

391
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,400
are up to her.

392
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,200
Lin Ling.

393
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,700
Don't act like I don't know.

394
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:19,500
You were the one who approached that con artist.

395
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:22,200
If we really need to find someone to blame,

396
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,700
then the first to be fired would be you.

397
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:28,500
Director Fang, I don't know what you're saying.

398
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:33,200
Don't forget.

399
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:36,930
I'm still this company's vice president.

400
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:41,490
Did you think that she could protect you?

401
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:54,590
So, that's why you're resigning?

402
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:59,820
I won't help them speak,

403
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:02,950
so they definitely won't let me go.

404
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:08,730
A few days ago,  Feiyu Batteries was still scouting me.

405
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:12,290
I didn't want to go at first,

406
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:16,620
but now, it seems to be an exit path.

407
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:18,930
How far have you gotten on your resignation letter?

408
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,460
I just started it.

409
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:29,220
[Resignation Letter]

410
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,900
You want to lower your head to them?

411
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,140
I won't lower my head and you don't have to resign.

412
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:38,670
Lubao isn't run by Fang alone.

413
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:41,520
Okay.

414
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:52,090
Xiaotian,

415
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:54,320
let's go visit the client.

416
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,120
But don't we leave at 11:00?

417
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,100
I changed my mind.

418
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:47,290
What are you doing?

419
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:53,440
I was just... cleaning up the things that could be sent by courier.

420
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:57,060
You're still leaving?

421
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:59,810
Yes. I promised Zhu Xiaobai

422
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:02,620
that I will report to his company within half a month.

423
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:19,060
What happened with Sister Yuan's situation?

424
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:23,440
I didn't say anything.

425
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,120
Why not?

426
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:29,720
She doesn't deserve my help.

427
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:35,050
If you did it, you wouldn't be doing it for her, but for yourself.

428
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:39,140
I know. You wish that I was kind and magnanimous,

429
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:41,570
but what would I get by doing that?

430
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:43,570
My kindness gets rewarded by suspicion.

431
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:46,300
My magnanimity gets returned by finding all sorts of ways to frame me.

432
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,950
In the end, I get nothing.

433
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:51,930
- But at least your heart is at peace. 
 - What could a peaceful heart possibly do for me?

434
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:55,290
If GM Pan wasn't always standing by me, I would have been kicked out long ago.

435
00:38:56,810 --> 00:39:00,710
So you must treat people

436
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:03,060
the exact same way they treat you?

437
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:06,750
I didn't cause her any harm, I just kept quiet.

438
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:09,140
But that's still so shady.

439
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:12,570
As long as I am the winner, then that is the biggest glory.

440
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:16,370
- Is your career that important? 
 - If careers weren't important, then why would you leave Shanghai?

441
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:19,150
In Shanghai, you feel like a failure.

442
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:22,000
You feel like you've lost all of your confidence.

443
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,300
I'm sorry.

444
00:39:56,930 --> 00:40:00,950
Yiming, I never thought you were a failure.

445
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:04,300
I really don't have the right

446
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:07,240
to ask you to do what I planned.

447
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:10,460
Are you disappointed in me?

448
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:14,070
No, I'm disappointed in myself.

449
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:21,350
If you want to go back, then go.

450
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:32,990
Then...

451
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:36,490
- then we... 
 - We can have a long-distance relationship, I guess.

452
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,880
Long-distance?

453
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:44,630
Anyway, I'm not leaving you.

454
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,700
Zhizhi,

455
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:56,670
- can I not go? 
 - You have to.

456
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,800
Can't you just take Yuwei?

457
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,310
The whole family has to go make an appearance

458
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:06,730
at this kind of party. It's the right attitude.

459
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:09,800
It also expresses that you find your child's education to be important

460
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:13,880
and also expresses respect to the people who host it.

461
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:18,550
But whenever I think of Miao Miao's mom's face,

462
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:21,550
- my heart feels deeply unsettled. 
 - That was in the past.

463
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:24,900
Nowadays, we're quite close.

464
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:27,460
I still have work.

465
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:48,390
What kind of expression is that?

466
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:51,930
That outfit

467
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:54,150
makes you hard to recognize.

468
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:56,390
This...

469
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,210
Is it pretty?

470
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:04,640
- Yes. 
 - Mommy is so pretty!

471
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,520
Let's go.

472
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:15,990
Come in.

473
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:18,570
Come on in. Welcome.

474
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:23,050
Let's go play.

475
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:28,340
- Be careful. 
 - Hi, Xingxing's mom.

476
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:30,160
- You're here? 
 - Where's Xingxing's dad?

477
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,900
He's... Oh, he's

478
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:33,660
over there chatting with Weili's dad.

479
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:36,770
They used to be schoolmates in the Ivy League.

480
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:41,760
Yuwei's dad, did you go to the states for college, too?

481
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,410
What school?

482
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:47,710
- Is Xingxing's father looking for you? 
 - No, we can leave him.

483
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:51,080
So, did you get your undergraduate and master's degrees in America?

484
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:54,840
- Honestly.. .
 - Honestly, they weren't very prestigious schools.

485
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,490
Compared to Xingxing's dad,

486
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:59,030
we're too embarrassed to say.

487
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:02,790
Everyone says that our party

488
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:05,830
is so much more superior to Vivian's sorority party.

489
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:08,030
- What do you mean Vivian? 
 - Do know what her family used to do for a living? 
 - What?

490
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:10,290
Her father was a farmer.

491
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:13,580
No way!

492
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:16,580
- You're all here? 
 - Come.

493
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:19,710
Yeah. Your outfit is so pretty.

494
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:22,420
Yuwei's father is also here? Hello.

495
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:26,170
Yuwei's dad, you work at Guangcai Engineering and Construction, correct?

496
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:28,510
Then you probably know Wang Changhai, don't you?

497
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:31,540
Yes. He's our department's leader.

498
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:34,070
Aren't you also a leader?

499
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:37,020
- Yes. 
 - Really?

500
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:39,930
Let me tell you. Wang Changhai's wife was my classmate.

501
00:43:39,930 --> 00:43:41,730
We're often at reunions together.

502
00:43:41,730 --> 00:43:45,280
If you have time, we can all hang out together!

503
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,490
Linda's mom, how are you liking my party so far?

504
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:51,750
- It's wonderful! 
 - Really? 
 - Perfect!

505
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:53,640
Look at the children, they're so happy.

506
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:56,190
- Yeah. They love it. 
 - Exactly. It's amazing. 
 - Oh right.

507
00:43:56,190 --> 00:43:59,320
Let me introduce some friends to you.

508
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,120
There's a designer from France.

509
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,930
It would be perfect. He could design some prettier clothes for you.

510
00:44:02,930 --> 00:44:05,470
- Really? 
 - Yes.

511
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:08,090
Come, let's go.

00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:54,450
♫  Yet I've never thought of letting you go  ♫

521
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:57,780
♫  Yeah…  ♫

522
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:00,800
♫  Oh…  ♫

523
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,500
♫  En…  ♫

524
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:03,990
♫  Letting go…  ♫

525
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:07,530
♫  Dear Myself  ♫

526
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:10,560
♫  Listen to the voice inside  ♫

527
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:14,570
♫  In this lonely world, be cautious ♫

528
00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:16,770
 After we're hurt, we learn to cherish  ♫

529
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:20,280
♫  Dear Myself  ♫

530
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:23,530
♫  Use all your strength  ♫

531
00:45:23,530 --> 00:45:27,790
♫  Missing the simple you from the past  ♫

532
00:45:27,790 --> 00:45:29,990
♫  Turn difficulties into courage  ♫

533
00:45:29,990 --> 00:45:34,850
♫  Don't back down from the crowd  ♫

534
00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:37,230
♫  Growth is inevitably accompanied by setbacks  ♫

535
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:39,940
♫  The best way to overcome difficulties is to smile  ♫

536
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:42,030
♫  All the punishment given by fate, are you afraid?  ♫

537
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:44,240
♫  Let everything go, all those concerns, real or fake  ♫

538
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:47,390
♫  Cannot erase the scar, but it's just a scar  ♫

539
00:45:47,390 --> 00:45:49,070
♫  Cannot erase the scar, but it's just a scar  ♫

540
00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:50,660
♫  Occasionally fussy and occasionally firm  ♫

541
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:53,100
♫  If growth leaves a trace, then the trace is left be tears  ♫

542
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:56,910
♫  Your back that I've always been chasing  ♫

543
00:45:56,910 --> 00:45:59,130
♫  Finally turned around to hug me tightly  ♫

544
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:02,690
♫  It's still that familiar you  ♫

545
00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:05,990
♫  Yeah...  ♫

546
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:10,120
♫  Oh...  ♫

547
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:15,500
♫  Dear Myself  ♫

548
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:18,830
♫  Listen to the voice inside  ♫

549
00:46:18,830 --> 00:46:22,830
♫  I'll give you the warm that the wind took  ♫

550
00:46:22,830 --> 00:46:25,270
♫  Hugging you, hugging me  ♫

551
00:46:25,270 --> 00:46:28,580
♫   Dear Myself  ♫

552
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:32,660
♫  The sky has finally cleared  ♫

553
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:35,940
♫  We've never been so clear-headed  ♫

554
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:37,930
♫  Looking for the past me who  ♫

555
00:46:37,930 --> 00:46:41,550
♫  Ran forward without evading anything  ♫

556
00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:44,750
♫  Ran forward without evading anything  ♫

557
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:48,080
♫  Listen to the voice inside  ♫

558
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:52,600
♫  The sky has finally cleared  ♫
