[Episode 23]

4
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:41,640
The house is a little messy, please don't mind it.

5
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,170
What's this? I'll help you clean it up in a bit.

6
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:48,320
No need. I can clean it up myself.

7
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,470
I already said I'd help you clean up. Come on.

8
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:02,330
Be good and sit.

9
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,570
Come here, Yuwei. I'll carry you.

10
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,320
Wait!

11
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,440
Wait a second! Wait!

12
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:49,760
Mom, why is Dad still not back yet?

13
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,860
Dad went on a business trip. He will be back in a few days.

14
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:56,780
Brother Yang, come eat.

15
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:21,900
Sit.

16
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,980
Thank you, Yayun.

17
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,360
What are you thanking me for?

18
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,850
Consider today as me coming to warm the house up.

19
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,190
Oh right!

20
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,830
There's something good.

21
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,980
- Little potatoes again? 
 - I specially roasted them for you.

22
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:54,370
Yayun, you treat me so well.

23
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:58,240
Brother Yang, I want to treat you well for my whole life.

24
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,290
- Hello? 
 - Hello.

25
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,710
Do you need a loan?

26
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,670
Thank you. I don't.

27
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:56,550
Mom, I want to play on the phone.

28
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,590
You can only play for 10 minutes.

29
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:17,240
This is Mom. This is me. This is Dad.

30
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,660
Mom, when will Dad come back?

31
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:55,280
Hello, Mom, it's me.

32
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,860
Zhizhi, how have you all been?

33
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,120
Zhizhi? Can you hear me?

34
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,810
Mom,

35
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,120
he is having an affair

36
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:17,630
with someone.

37
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,300
Is it that Xiao Wei from work?

38
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,720
Mom, you know?

39
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:29,180
You... tell Yang to answer the phone. I'll scold him.

40
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:34,970
Mom... he moved out of the house.

41
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:39,930
Yang really has no conscience.

42
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:43,590
Zhizhi, don't worry. Mom is definitely on your side.

43
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:47,940
I'll get him to break up with that girl immediately and come home to apologize to you.

44
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:51,590
Mom,

45
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,950
you're so sensible.

46
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:59,670
Zhizhi,  but I-I have to advise you.

47
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:03,190
When he gets home, don't argue or bother him;

48
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:07,330
or else, he'll run back to her when she waves her hand.

49
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:09,240
Do you hear?

50
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,890
Okay. I'll listen to you.

51
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:22,690
Okay. Then I'm hanging up now.

52
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:37,890
Are you stupid? If you lose Zhizhi,

53
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:39,960
 you will regret it in the future.

54
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,800
I know how to take care of this problem.

55
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,360
You brat, if you don't listen to me, then you're not my son anymore.

56
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,410
Mom.

57
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:49,570
Today, go back home.

58
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,420
- But Zhizhi— 
 - Yang,

59
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:58,530
Zhizhi already promised me that as long as you go home,

60
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:00,190
 this problem will be left in the past.

61
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:03,460
She won't make it difficult for you anymore.

62
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,260
- I'll think about it. 
 - Think about what?

63
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,360
What is there to think about? That is how it is going to be.

64
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,290
Okay. I've still have work to do. I'm going to get back to work.

65
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:49,160
 Brother Yang, don't get too tired. 

66
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,940
Let's watch a movie together tonight.

67
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:27,140
Okay, okay, okay.

68
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:29,880
- All right, all right, all right. 
 - Come on, come on, come on.

69
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,380
Up you go.

70
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:34,540
I still want to play! Woah!

71
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:37,220
Come up. One.

72
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:42,040
How about we take a break? Aunt is already tired.

73
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,590
I still want to play!

74
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:47,400
Zhizhi, Yang really wants to go home.

75
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:51,600
He also acknowledges his wrongdoings and promised not to do it again.

76
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,780
Really?

77
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:55,270
He told me himself.

78
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:02,620
But he still hasn't... called me or messaged me.

79
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:07,070
Men, they admit their faults in their heart, but they still want to save face.

80
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:10,570
Zhizhi, how about you take some initiative?

81
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:15,200
Call him or pick him up from work.

82
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:25,340
- Are you tired? 
 - Yes.

83
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:29,080
Taking care of a child is too exhausting. It's really not easy.

84
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:32,960
I'm also tired.

85
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,630
What do you have to be tired of?

86
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:40,870
I have to fight against gravity and age. Do you think that's easy?

87
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:44,300
Then, do you think you can win against gravity and age?

88
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:49,080
Even though I can't win, I still need to fight until the very end.

89
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,600
I'm too lazy to care about you.

90
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,160
I'm too lazy to care about you.

91
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,100
What did she say?

92
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:20,770
Can you guys help me find out

93
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:23,320
where Liu Yang is living right now?

94
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,490
What do you want to do?

95
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:32,940
I want to give him an opportunity to get out of this.

96
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:36,380
Did he personally admit his wrongs to you?

97
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:40,340
He did to his mom.

98
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:45,650
Besides, I am also partially at fault.

99
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:49,090
Can you really forgive him?

100
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:55,030
I'm willing to forgive him

101
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:58,220
for Yuwei's sake.

102
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,970
That's fine.

103
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,220
One, two, three.

104
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,210
Okay.

105
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:20,500
Does it look good?

106
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,820
Yes.

107
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,420
Hey, what do you want to do this weekend?

108
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,660
Whatever you want.

109
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:29,380
Then, how about we invite your parents to eat a meal with us?

110
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:32,630
They have plans this weekend. They'll be away.

111
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:34,970
Last time I wanted to invite them, they were in Europe.

112
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:38,120
The time before that, they went to Thailand. The time even before that—

113
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:42,510
Xiaoling, I just think the time is not right yet.

114
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:44,810
Then, when will the time be right?

115
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:47,830
Do you know that according to my family's traditions,

116
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:51,670
if you meet my parents, it means we are about to get married?

117
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:54,690
You mean, you are not ready to get married to me?

118
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:58,690
I just think that we're not at that age yet.

119
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,570
Got it.

120
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:03,560
I actually really like how we are right now.

121
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:07,300
We have the sweetness of love, but not the triviality of marriage.

122
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:10,120
Then aren't you afraid that I'll run away with someone else?

123
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,740
I am.

124
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,580
But I know...

125
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:19,390
you won't.

126
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,270
I'm coming.

127
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,860
So fast?

128
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,600
I just placed the order, is it already here?

129
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:54,420
I'm coming, I'm coming.

130
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,430
Xiaoling?

131
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,680
Wait a minute!

132
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,710
Li Haowen, what are you doing? Did you hide a man in there?

133
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:09,190
I'm changing clothes, I'll be ready soon.

134
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:12,160
Open the door! If you don't, I'm leaving!

135
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,270
Coming, coming, coming.

136
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:24,200
Please come in.

137
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:43,380
How do you know where I live?

138
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:47,450
Figuring out where your home is, isn't that easy?

139
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,570
Help me with something.

140
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:56,340
Didn't you say that you wouldn't come looking for me even if you were dying?

141
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,580
Let go.

142
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:03,450
I was just kidding. I'm very happy you came.

143
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:06,970
Sit, sit, sit.

144
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,750
Drink some orange juice.

145
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:14,870
Open it.

146
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:22,320
You hurt me so deeply,

147
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,810
can't I just talk about it a bit?

148
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:28,130
Tell me. What do you want me to do?

149
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:32,020
Not just one thing, but eight or ten things, as long as I can do it,

150
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,900
I will go through fire and water and will not refuse under any circumstances!

151
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:37,800
Be my ex-boyfriend.

152
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:40,660
What did you say?

153
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:45,030
Be my ex-boyfriend.

154
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:50,050
I've never even been your boyfriend, how can I be your ex-boyfriend?

155
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:52,270
Are you going to help me or not?

156
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:54,160
Forgive me for I cannot comply with your wishes.

157
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:05,920
Can you just let me be your current boyfriend for a while?

158
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:11,060
Current boyfriend?

159
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:22,940
Be more gentle!

160
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,680
Ow, ow, ow.

161
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,190
Will you help me or not?

162
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:29,470
Help, help, I'll help.

163
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:32,480
You really hurt me.

164
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,920
Remember. You have to strictly follow my plan.

165
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:39,410
What plan?

166
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,470
First: drive that roaster sports car of yours.

167
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:46,730
You must figure out where the car roof switch is this time.

168
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:47,960
Second:

169
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:52,770
rush to me with a ring and flowers to propose.

170
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:56,020
This way, Wei Shang will surely get jealous.

171
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:59,580
Then seize this opportunity to provoke him, to force him to propose to me.

172
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,530
Do you understand?

173
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:16,990
I understand very well.

174
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,300
Then I'll go set up a time.

175
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,490
Don't be so impatient.

176
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,200
I have to think about this.

177
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,200
What do you have to think about?

178
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,220
This character is so important. I have to think about how to be immersed in the role.

179
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:30,330
Thank you.

180
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,100
- What are you looking at? 
 - Nothing.

181
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,840
Let me look at the menu.

182
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,610
You look and tell me if you want to eat anything else.

183
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:59,260
Where are you? What is going on?

184
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:04,900
Are you still not done looking?

185
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:09,590
I'm giving you five minutes to get here; or else, never show up in my life again!

186
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:43,240
Xiaoling.

187
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,170
Xiaoling.

188
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:48,950
That man is calling you.

189
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:51,200
Really?

190
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:57,000
Gu Xiaoling.

191
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:07,050
I'm begging you. Give me another chance.

192
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:10,940
Lei Haowen, get up.

193
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:13,030
If you don't say yes, I won't get up.

194
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:15,090
We already broke up!

195
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:18,280
But my world can't be without you, Gu Xiaoling.

196
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:23,960
Gu Xiaoling, marry me!

197
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:27,320
This is not possible! I already have a boyfriend.

198
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,800
It's fine. That's not important.

199
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:34,310
As long as you haven't gotten married, then I still have an opportunity, Xiaoling.

200
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:37,260
I can give you whatever you want. I can buy you purses,

201
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,710
lipsticks, big villas,

202
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:43,650
sports cars. As long as you want them, I can give them all to you. Xiaoling, marry me!

203
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:46,760
I can give you happiness Xiaoling!

204
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:51,530
This is my fiancé. We're going to get married very soon.

205
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,890
Impossible.

206
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:03,430
That's impossible. That is just your excuse, right?

207
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:06,110
- Marry me, Xiaoling. 
 - Bro.

208
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:18,770
Come on, get up.

209
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:25,420
The second you came in, you made a huge mistake.

210
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,460
Proposals are huge things.

211
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:29,620
Look at you, dressed all disorderly.

212
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:32,160
You look like you're fleeing from famine.

213
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:41,510
Also, these flowers. From these flowers, I can see

214
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:44,190
that you have already put a lot of heart into them.

215
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:48,160
But you should learn to leave some space, understand?

216
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:52,600
Also, the way you kneeled.

217
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:56,550
You're proposing, not praying during Happy New Year. You must put only one knee to the ground.

218
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:58,330
The most important part is

219
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:02,200
that at this time, purses, lipsticks,

220
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,230
sports cars, and big villas are all useless.

221
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:08,000
The most important thing is being sincere.

222
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:11,790
Here. Let me show you an example.

223
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:20,170
My love,

224
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:23,140
will you marry me?

225
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,880
I—

226
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:35,540
Did you see it? You have to do it like this.

227
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,650
Here. You try.

228
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:42,840
- Me? 
 - Yeah. Take it. Give it a try.

229
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:47,090
Good luck. I'll help you record this.

230
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:49,220
Afterward, you can see if you're not happy about anything,

231
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,420
so you can change when you get back.

232
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:07,090
Nevermind, Xiaoling. It's never too late to propose.

233
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:09,850
This time, it's my fault that I didn't prepare well.

234
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:12,450
I'll come back again after more preparation, okay?

235
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:30,830
You're not mad at all?

236
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:35,180
Xiaoling, sit and talk.

237
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:38,500
Sit down to talk.

238
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:48,450
A man would only be that helpless in front of the woman he loves the most.

239
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:51,330
Xiaoling, I recommend that

240
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:54,530
you think about his proposal seriously.

241
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:56,640
Then, what about us?

242
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:59,780
We...

243
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,930
I really like you.

244
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:08,170
But I'm afraid that we can only be boyfriend and girlfriend.

245
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:10,340
Why?

246
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:15,870
I'm afraid that my parents won't accept you.

247
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:19,640
Your parents haven't even met me, why would they reject me?

248
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:26,160
My parents definitely won't approve of me getting married to a woman that's three years older than me.

249
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:31,990
Was I only older than you today? What were you doing earlier?

250
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,890
Besides, if you didn't look at my ID, who would know I'm older than you by three years?

251
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:38,440
My parents can tell.

252
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:43,310
Xiaoling, as long as we don't talk about getting married,

253
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:47,350
or meeting parents, we can still continue to date.

254
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:52,350
Continue my ass!

255
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:16,050
♫  Summer is hot, the wind blows as usual ♫

256
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:21,420
♫  Yet you arouse my warmth ♫

257
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:28,290
I told you earlier on,

258
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:33,210
that that guy has a face of an asshole. You just didn't believe me.

259
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:40,960
Don't feel upset.

260
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,210
Breaking up with him is a good thing.

261
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:48,570
If you continued to be with him, that would be a tragedy.

262
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:51,820
Be happier.

263
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,960
I'm happy for you.

264
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:04,910
Do you think I'm a failure?

265
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:06,890
No.

266
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:14,420
Next year, I'll be 33 years old.

267
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:22,090
What's wrong with being 33 years old? I'm 34 years old.

268
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:26,120
After 33...

269
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:29,290
is 34.

270
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:33,340
Then it's 35,

271
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,940
36,

272
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:41,750
37.

273
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,490
Age isn't a problem.

274
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:51,450
Worst comes to worst, I can get Chen Yiming to introduce someone to you.

275
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:54,130
He knows many elites.

276
00:28:54,930 --> 00:29:01,280
If that doesn't work, then you can go try online dating.

277
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,620
I'll probably be like this

278
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:23,090
my entire life.

279
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:53,430
No.

280
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:02,950
We should go through the normal procedure.

281
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,750
I want to keep fighting for another ten years!

282
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:11,050
- Fight another ten years! 
 - Fight for another ten years!

283
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:21,340
[💕Three Flowers🌻
Gu Xiaoling: ShangHai Spring City, Shanghai, South Lianhua Road 1108...]

284
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:24,830
 Zhizhi, this is Liu Yang's address.

285
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:27,500
 Thanks, Xiaoling.

286
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:31,580
 I'm going abroad today. Take care of yourselves when I'm gone.

287
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:34,310
 Going abroad? To get plastic surgery?

288
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:37,270
Wait for me to come back 10 years younger.

289
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:39,290
Li Siyu: Troublesome~~~

290
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:41,740
If anything happens, give me a call.

291
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:57,590
Hello. I want to ask where Lane 62, Building 3 is?

292
00:30:57,590 --> 00:31:00,460
It's over there. Enter the gate and turn left.

293
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:02,400
Thank you. Let's go.

294
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:04,410
Come on.

295
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,160
Come here, baby.

296
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,540
Wait a second.

297
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:55,750
Come home.

298
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:12,820
Yuwei, what should we say when we see Daddy?

299
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:17,610
Daddy, I miss you a lot. Mommy misses you, too.

300
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:19,850
Come home with Mommy.

301
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:24,060
What should we do if Daddy doesn't come home?

302
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,680
Then I'll do this.

303
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:46,280
Brother Yang, do you want to buy flowers?

304
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:49,100
- Which one do you want? 
 - I like this one.

305
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,020
Come here, Yuwei.

306
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:59,550
- Will you be paying via Wechat? 
 - Yes, WeChat.

307
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:03,230
- Okat, take care. 
 - Thank you. 
 - Thanks, Brother Yang.

308
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:32,700
Brother Yang.

309
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:36,560
Get on.

310
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,870
Sister Siyu.

311
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:26,260
What's wrong?

312
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:28,490
I want to divorce him.

313
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:30,880
Weren't you going to...

314
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:33,590
I must get a divorce.

315
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:37,230
As long as it's your decision, I will support you.

316
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:44,220
- It's fine, it's fine. 
 - Sister Siyu.

317
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:46,000
What's got you all in a panic?

318
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,670
The Supervision Department wants you to go to the meeting room. Hurry.

319
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,880
Wait for me.

320
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:12,290
Are you Liu Yang? Take a seat.

321
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:35,520
We received named reports from Dayue Group and Sangke Group successively.

322
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,260
They reflected that this bidding

323
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,870
is suspected of being involved with playing favoritism and committing irregularities.

324
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:41,990
Today, we especially came to do an investigation.

325
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:49,790
Ms. Li, may I ask what your relationship with Liu Yang is?

326
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:51,310
He is the husband of my younger cousin.

327
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:54,510
In this bidding, did he disclose the circumstances regarding

328
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:57,600
the experts of this bidding evaluation?

329
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,940
I never did that.

330
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:09,040
The email is also not mine.

331
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,600
- You guys can go investigate it. 
 - Do you still remember this email?

332
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,920
I indeed received this email before the bidding.

333
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:21,060
- Are they not done? 
 - No.

334
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:25,930
But I deleted it immediately.

335
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:29,310
Also, I didn't contact any of the experts on this list.

336
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:31,660
You can investigate it.

337
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:38,100
Was it Liu Yang who sent you this email?

338
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:41,220
I don't know. I don't know the sender.

339
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:45,270
Who do you think sent this email to you then?

340
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:47,120
I don't know.

341
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:50,410
What's the relationship between you and Liu Yang?

342
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:55,510
He...

343
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:59,560
He is my leader.

344
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,600
Besides that?

345
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,190
I'm only an intern.

346
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:11,270
I have to listen to what he says to do.

347
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:17,260
Someone claims that your relationship with Liu Yang is more than that of leader and intern.

348
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,220
That's not true.

349
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,140
We don't have any other relationship.

350
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:25,450
Do you know that Li Siyu from Lubao

351
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:28,680
is the cousin of Liu Yang's wife?

352
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,660
- Take it. 
 - Don't worry. 

353
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:32,670
We got enough money.

354
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:35,360
Zhizhi's cousin helped us pay for a part of it.

355
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:38,430
According to what you know of Liu Yang and Li Siyu,

356
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:41,630
was there any benefit transferred between them?

357
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:45,780
Are you still in your internship?

358
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:48,630
I remember that Liu Yang said he has a cousin.

359
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:51,500
Is she Li Siyu?

360
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,190
Okay. Be more specific.

361
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:01,400
Ms. Li, this signature is yours. Right?

362
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:03,700
Yes.

363
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,850
The day after you received the list of experts,

364
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:10,360
you went to the hospital to pay the fees.

365
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:14,040
After two days, Lubao won the bidding.

366
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:17,920
An elder person suddenly had a heart attack. I paid the money to save her life.

367
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,740
This has nothing to do with the bidding.

368
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:23,050
This is at most a mutual assistance between family.

369
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,380
During the whole bidding process,

370
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:29,380
Lubao and I didn't do anything to violate the laws and rules.

371
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:37,900
This is just a coincidence in time.

372
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:41,800
Is it?

373
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,810
Indeed, I should have reported to my superiors

374
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:47,190
the relationship between Zhang Zhizhi, Li Siyu, and I.

375
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:49,240
This was my negligence.

376
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,300
But I didn't play favoritism and commit irregularities

377
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:55,280
Li Siyu and I didn't exchange any benefits.

378
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:59,790
Also, I believe that Li Siyu didn't do anything to violate the rules.

379
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:11,470
GM Wang, this is what the Information Department just got.

380
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:16,050
The two companies that lost the bidding have already real-name reported Lubao on the internet.

381
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:19,990
They say that before the bidding, Lubao had already got

382
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:22,820
the list of experts participating in the bidding evaluation.

383
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:25,170
Are there a lot of people paying attention to this right now?

384
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:28,360
How do you think this situation

385
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,710
will end?

386
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:33,470
I don't know.

387
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,460
Well, what do you think the worst-case scenario will be?

388
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:43,810
The government will cancel the contract that they already signed.

389
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:47,790
If they merely cancel the contract, then it's simple.

390
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:51,550
Then what could possibly be the worst outcome?

391
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:58,490
I originally had an appointment with a new client to talk about financing.

392
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:02,010
They probably have heard something

393
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:03,880
and canceled.

394
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:08,060
Let's just wait for the result.

395
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:11,220
Director, I want to appeal.

396
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,340
There is no use.

397
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:17,090
Even if you can prove

398
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:20,270
that the email has nothing to do with you.

399
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:26,510
But the familial relationship you have with Li Siyu,

400
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:28,970
the money Li Siyu paid,

401
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:31,090
and Lubao's win of the bid

402
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:33,280
are all facts.

403
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:37,860
Besides these, there is circumstantial evidence.

404
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:42,480
They say that you indeed paid special attention to Lubao.

405
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,830
They also heard that you said something like

406
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:48,710
"Don't meet during this particular time."

407
00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:59,000
This situation will, of course,

408
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,200
be further investigated.

409
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:06,220
For you, they may prove that you are innocent

410
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:09,740
or create legal problems.

411
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:11,750
We really don't know.

412
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:13,640
But no matter what,

413
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:16,860
this has hurt the company's reputation.

414
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:24,690
So, in order to protect you,

415
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:30,030
and in consideration

416
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:31,960
of the company's reputation,...

417
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:41,440
Director Li, the leaders have already clearly instructed

418
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:45,060
to cancel all the contracts with Lubao Group

419
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:48,710
 as well as keep the right to deal with it legally.

420
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,740
Due to the adjustment of the company's business,

421
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:03,820
these following people voluntarily resigned.

422
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:07,690
Liu Yang, etc. The notice is hereby given.

425
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:39,620
Brother Yang.

426
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:42,690
- I just received a call from your director. 
 - I know.

427
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:45,500
Is there no way to turn things around?

428
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,290
No.

429
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:54,180
You...

430
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:01,330
I've been fired.

431
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:09,130
Brother Yang, sorry.

432
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:11,120
It was all my fault.

433
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,990
I really didn't think it would end up like this.

434
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:17,210
- I thought— 
 - Siyu,

435
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:22,190
when you received the email, why didn't you tell me right away?

436
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:27,350
I thought you sent it to me.

437
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:29,460
How could I possibly?

438
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:33,190
You told me that during this period

439
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:35,760
not to meet and contact you.

440
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,900
So...

441
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:56,080

Such a shame in our industry!

447
00:44:25,310 --> 00:44:27,230
No matter it's offering or accepting bribes, they all should be punished severely!
