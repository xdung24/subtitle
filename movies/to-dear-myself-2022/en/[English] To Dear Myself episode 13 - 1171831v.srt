[Episode 13]

4
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,990
Mom, listen to me. Get everything together,

5
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:46,050
and then at the entrance of our house,

6
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:49,420
there's a public bus numbered 106.

7
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:53,200
Then, Mom, ride the bus for five stops. Only five stops.

8
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,860
After you get off the bus, go pass a stoplight,

9
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:01,480
then cross a road, and you've arrived, Mom.

10
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,330
I got it.

11
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:05,350
Okay. Be safe.

12
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:08,030
Okay, okay, okay. Don't worry.

13
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,810
Yuwei, when you're in class,

14
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:14,740
make sure to listen to the lesson, do you understand?

15
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:18,910
Mama, I want Dad to take me in his car.

16
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:23,600
I can't today, Yuwei. Dad has work to do.

17
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,270
Yuwei, be good. Dad works really hard.

18
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:29,270
- Dad also has to do homework, you understand? 
 - Yes.

19
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,550
Hey, can't you take her?

20
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:36,390
I want to. I also want to stay with you.

21
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:40,420
I've promised those moms. I can't stand them up.

22
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,340
Then have my mom take her.

23
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:45,760
Okay, okay. I'll go. I'll take her.

24
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,910
Yuwei, Grandma will take you in a bit.

25
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:52,220
I'll buy you candy to eat.

26
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:01,490
Mom, Yuwei already has cavities, she can't eat any more candy.

27
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:05,120
I'm just saying that.

28
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,370
I was just saying it so that she'd come with me.

29
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:12,760
Then, be safe.

30
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,420
I got it.

31
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:21,030
- I'm going now, Mom  
 - Go, go.

32
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:23,960
- Yuwei, make sure you listen. 
 - Okay.

33
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:37,150
- Liu Yang. 
 - Yeah?

34
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:42,300
I'll just go alone.

35
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:53,110
Why does such a little kid need to go to early classes?

36
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:55,730
Here. Drink some water.

37
00:03:55,730 --> 00:04:00,760
Loot at your dad. He played with chickens and ducks all day when he was young.

38
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:06,000
He just played like crazy and didn't learn anything. Now he has become a talent, hasn't he?

39
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,350
Mom, the environment Yuwei is growing up in is different from the one I grew up in.

40
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:14,110
What's different? I don't think anything's different. In my opinion, it's just a waste of money.

41
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:16,830
Zhizhi said that daughters must be raised in riches.

42
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:20,830
Raised in riches. She's eating all your money yet she still wants to raise her in riches.

43
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:33,400
- Zhizhi. Zhizhi. 
 - Yeah?

44
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,600
Don't look so miserable. Come choose clothes.

45
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,690
Xiaoling, do you think my fight

46
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:42,380
will get Sister Siyu into trouble?

47
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:46,090
You've been talking about this since you arrived. Aren't you annoyed by it?

48
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:48,030
I'm just worried.

49
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:51,450
Don't worry. Li Siyu is like a cockroach that cannot be killed.

50
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:54,960
You need to pay close attention to Liu Yang's issue.

51
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,280
Zhizhi, hurry and come choose.

52
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:01,590
Come over and choose for yourself.

53
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,300
Here, this one.

54
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,340
This won't work, right?

55
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:15,230
This one. Take it or leave it. If you don't want it, there's no other choice.

56
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:25,940
- Hello, Aunty. 
 - Hi, we're here for school.

57
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,710
Okay, school is this way.

58
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:31,690
Okay. Come quicker, follow the teacher.

59
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,660
- Hello! 
 - Hi, Teacher.

60
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:50,960
Hi, what's your name?

61
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,230
I'm Liu Yuwei.

62
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:56,710
Hi! This is for you.

63
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:58,480
Take it.

64
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,380
Excuse me, you are...?

65
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,760
Grandma. I'm her grandma.

66
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:08,330
Grandma, please wait outside. We are about to start.

67
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:12,560
Okay. Yuwei, study well.

68
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,750
- Don't waste money. 
 - Yes! 
 - Go on.

69
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:28,690
I really can't get it on.

70
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:30,210
Step down!

71
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:47,000
How is it?

72
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:52,330
Chest out. Relax your shoulders.

73
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:53,860
Relax. Put your leg forward.

74
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:56,460
- How? 
 - Put your leg forward. This leg.

75
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:00,000
Put your leg forward. This way.

76
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,290
Suck in your stomach. Hurry up. Suck in your stomach.

77
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,000
You have to remember that the you right now...

78
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,580
Isn't Yuwei's mom or Liu Yang's wife.

79
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:18,170
You are not an admin worker of Lubao. You are a beautiful woman.

80
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,210
Beauty.

81
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:30,810
Look at your skin, it's glowing and so smooth. And your eyes,

82
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:37,050
are big and bright. Your chest... well, it's not as big as mine.

83
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:42,170
And your waist... your waist is so thin, your legs are so long.

84
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:48,220
Zhizhi, put your hands down and look in the mirror.

85
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,220
So charming and seductive.

86
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:54,510
Is this still me?

87
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,850
Of course, it's you.

88
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:03,100
Stand up straight. Put your hand down.

89
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:09,620
We should start to learn English early. We are afraid we will fall behind at the beginning.

90
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,370
Definitely. English must start at a young age.

91
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:13,570
How old is your child?

92
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:17,670
- 4 years and 1/2 a month. 
 - My child is 48 months.

93
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:22,090
This class is recommended by others. It's too expensive. More than ¥20,000.

94
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:25,870
It's so expensive yet I don't know how the teacher is.

95
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:30,270
Ask the kid when it finishes. If the teacher is not good, then we ask for a refund.

96
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:34,250
We can get a refund?

97
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,840
Aunt, you don't know.

98
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:40,240
If you aren't satisfied on the first day, you can get a refund for the whole ¥20,000.

99
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,860
¥20,000?!

100
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:56,380
Aunty, are you really not going to wait until your child is done with class and listen to what she says?

101
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:59,600
We don't need her opinion. I can decide. Refund.

102
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,150
- I'm in a rush. I have to go now. 
 - All right.

103
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:05,080
Xiao Zeng, please help Aunt with the refund.

104
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,070
- Here, drink some water. 
 - Okay, okay.

105
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:18,830
Aunt, Liu Yuwei's tuition was paid by a credit card at that time.

106
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:22,430
According to our rules, the money will be returned to the account in 20 workdays.

107
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:24,570
- That many days? 
 - Yes.

108
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:26,190
Those are our rules.

109
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,770
All right. Then refund in this way.

110
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:31,370
- Okay. Refund for her. 
 - Got it.

111
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,560
Don't be anxious.

112
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,590
I'll return these clothes, shoes, and bags to you on Monday.

113
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:41,150
They say we are just rehearsing today.

114
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:46,420
Just return the dress. The shoes... well, I won't call them a gift. The bag goes with the shoes, so just keep them.

115
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,880
No, that won't do.

116
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,610
I can't take this bag, it's probably really expensive.

117
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:54,740
It's not.

118
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,430
How much was it?

119
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,260
Not much.

120
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,430
Look at my bag.

121
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:05,590
¥58 on Taobao including the delivery fee.

122
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:07,920
You can even use that?

123
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,320
Yeah, it can hold a lot of things. Look.

124
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:17,560
Zhizhi, if you are not particular about anything, then others will also overlook you.

125
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:22,060
If you use a facial cream that's less than ¥100, people won't gift you skincare products over ¥1,000.

126
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:26,360
If your own bag is cheap, how could you expect others to gift you a Hermes?

127
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,870
Who would give me a gift?

128
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:37,350
Also your sighing! You really need to change it.

129
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,290
And don't say negative things.

130
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:44,770
Energy is mutually attracted. You can attract positive energy only if you yourself have positive energy.

131
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:53,940
You're right. If I always think of bad things,

132
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,100
then bad things will happen for sure.

133
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,890
That's Murphy's Law.

134
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:06,140
Xiaoling, I didn't expect you to know so much.

135
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:09,970
In the past did you think that besides loving money and being pretty, I wouldn't understand anything else?

136
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:14,620
No, I've never thought that.

137
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:19,970
It's fine if you thought that. If women are jealous of me, it means I'm charming.

138
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:22,150
Right?

139
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,520
Yuwei! Yuwei, come here.

140
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:57,820
Is it fun? Here, drink some milk.

141
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,370
It's more fun than early education classes, right?

142
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:03,640
Aunt!  Aunt, sorry.  Eating is not allowed here.

143
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,990
It wouldn't be good if the kid chokes.

144
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:07,870
- I get it. I get it. 
 - Sorry about that. Thank you.

145
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:10,560
Yuwei, let's go there.

146
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,920
Yuwei! Come here.

147
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:35,540
Come here.

148
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:42,860
She pushed you, why didn't you push her back? Are you foolish? Go push her.

149
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,380
Push her.

150
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:47,940
- Push her, push. 
 - Hey!

151
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:51,780
Why did your child just push my daughter?

152
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:55,280
Your daughter pushed my granddaughter first. Didn't you see it?

153
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,440
Even so, you can't teach the kids to fight.

154
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,340
Who's fighting? It's you who didn't teach your child well.

155
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:03,370
The apple does not fall far from the tree!

156
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:07,600
- Let's stop fighting. The kids are here to have fun. 
 - What kind of behavior is that?

157
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,710
What do you mean "what kind of behavior"? Do you have good behavior? You are uncultured.

158
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:14,200
- Who is uncultured? 
 - Let's go.

159
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,040
We don't play with this kind of people. Let's go.

160
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,650
- Let's forget about it. 
 - Such bad manners.

161
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:21,340
You are well mannered!

162
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,840
Come here. Let Mom take a look.

163
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:29,070
You have to be fierce. Don't be as weak as your mom. She can't get anything done.

164
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:31,550
- The clothes is nice, right? 
 - Miao Miao's mom, sorry.

165
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,960
- We are late.
 - It's okay.

166
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:37,700
Oh, I tried on some of those formal outfits last night.

167
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,950
I gained some weight recently. I can't put them on anymore.

168
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:42,970
- Really? 
 - I plan to wear cheongsam.

169
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:44,660
I'm going to wear a cheongsam, too.

170
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:47,620
- We better not have our outfits clash. 
 - That's right.

171
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:51,110
Let's go. Let's go. Hurry.

172
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,940
Doudou.

173
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:56,280
Why is he here?

174
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,590
Come on.

175
00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:00,560
Doudou, behave well, okay? Let's go home.

176
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:04,670
The teacher told me that the principal has already informed them

177
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:07,040
to not come here anymore.

178
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,710
Our letter worked.

179
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:13,900
 Doudou, let's go home. 

180
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:18,600
Put it down. Let's put that down, all right?

181
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,360
The more I see him now, the more annoyed I get.

182
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,410
The car is here. Let's get on the bus.

183
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:28,540
You get on first.

184
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:38,240
Doudou, don't go there.

185
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,030
The left one.

186
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:44,650
Stop playing. Let's go home.

187
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,530
Let's go.

188
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,230
The kid is too naughty.

189
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,060
What's the color of your cheongsam?

190
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,650
Green. What color is yours?

191
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,220
Mine is blue.

192
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:05,800
I want to wear a crystal brooch with it.

193
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:10,370
Crystal... What color of ear rings can I wear?

194
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:12,230
Gold. Gold looks nice.

195
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:15,530
Does gold go well with a green cheongsam?

196
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:17,580
It depends on how you put them together.

197
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,440
Sister Siyu,

198
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,900
the municipal lighting project has been assigned to Sister Yuan.

199
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,570
- What?
 - That's what the Customer Service Department said.

200
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:51,340
The bidding of the municipal lighting project was clearly mine. Why did you assign it to Sister Yuan?

201
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,800
Because she put it on the records first.

202
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:57,000
Please look carefully. I clearly put it on the record first.

203
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,810
I will check one more time for you.

204
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:08,740
Yuan Huizhong recorded it on 10th. it's very clearly written here.

205
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,740
Impossible!

206
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:16,300
Xiao Jiao, could you please check the records for me again?

207
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,840
Which one?

208
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,360
The municipal lights bidding one.

209
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:28,380
10th.

210
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,730
Sister Yuan recorded it on the 10th.

211
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:32,340
Impossible!

212
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:37,260
Xiao Jiao, the last time we checked, she recorded it on the 16th. Right?

213
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:41,310
I forgot.

214
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:43,920
You are the one who checked it for me, how could you forget?

215
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,230
There are so many people coming to me to make and check records every day, how can I remember it all?

216
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,720
I got it.

217
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:04,310
Did they find out?

218
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:08,070
The Customer Service Department says they didn't change any data.

219
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:11,960
The IT Department didn't find out the trace of changes.

220
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:17,390
The security department checked all the surveillance videos. Everything is normal.

221
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:18,740
Can I investigate it myself?

222
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,600
Is there a need for that?

223
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:25,790
Then... does that mean only she can represent Lubao for the bid?

224
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:27,980
What do you think? That it would be you?

225
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:16,910
Sister Siyu, you should have taken a photo.

226
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:20,400
I didn't think they would do this.

227
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:27,390
You should have known what they are like from the overtime pay issue last time.

228
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:29,570
I underestimated the enemy!

229
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:34,250
What do you plan to do now?

230
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,520
I admit defeat.

231
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,700
Now?

232
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:42,730
If it was only ¥1,000,000, I trust that I can beat them.

233
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:47,340
But this order is ¥28,000,000, I won't be able to catch up no matter what.

234
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:53,430
Then she will be the sales director?

235
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,830
I can only leave Lubao now.

236
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:10,410
Maybe even you

237
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,900
will have to leave.

238
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:24,260
Sister Siyu, listen to me. I have a solution.

239
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:27,710
I can ask Liu Yang not to pick Lubao.

240
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:29,410
This way,

241
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:34,240
Yuan Huizhong can't get the order. If she can't, you still have a chance to win.

242
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:36,340
That can't happen.

243
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:38,040
Why?

244
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:41,050
First, President Pan needs this order.

245
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:45,610
With this order, he will have more cards to play when they do equity financing.

246
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:47,330
Secondly,

247
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:53,470
that would be unfair. Liu Yang would be breaking the rules.

248
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:35,850
Elder Sister...

249
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:37,670
Xiao Chen,

250
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:41,350
our renting contract will end next month. Will you continue?

251
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:44,400
If you want to continue, I need to increase the rent.

252
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,750
How much do you plan to increase?

253
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:49,470
Not much. 15% more.

254
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,670
Hello?

255
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,760
Hello? What do you think, Xiao Chen?

256
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,400
So much more?

257
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:03,070
If you want to continue, just send me the money for next season's rent.

258
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:05,680
It's a total of ¥22,000.

259
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,220
If you don't continue, then I will check you out next month.

260
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:14,040
All right. Got it.

261
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:37,800
Bro, Sister Siyu had some issue at the company. She is in a very bad state right now.

262
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,980
You should go see her.

263
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:50,570
I wasn't able to reach you on the phone, so I could only wait here for you.

264
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,890
It's okay.

265
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:57,180
Ever since President Pan had the talk with me,

266
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:59,800
I started to be attacked by overt and covert means.

267
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,320
But I survived.

268
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:06,060
I thought the position of Sales Director was mine for sure.

269
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:08,810
But who could expect this?

270
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:18,500
When it comes to getting orders and managing the team,

271
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,350
I don't think I'm worse than Sister Yuan.

272
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:24,260
But in other aspects,

273
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,750
I will never be Sister Yuan's rival.

274
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,860
Are you happy that I failed?

275
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,570
How could I?

276
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:46,390
Then, are you mocking me?

277
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:48,110
Mock you?

278
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:50,310
How could I mock you?

279
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:52,510
I'm a failure myself.

280
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:54,150
How could I mock you?

281
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:55,920
Then, what were you laughing about?

282
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:02,450
Siyu,

283
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,160
come to my hometown with me.

284
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,240
How could I?

285
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:10,230
Before I came here I gave Zhu Xiaobai a call.

286
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:12,250
I told him our situation right now.

287
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:16,620
He said that they have a sales director position that they can give you.

288
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,140
Chen Yiming,

289
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,800
what are you thinking?

290
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,440
You and Sister Yuan have already gotten to this point,

291
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:26,080
after she becomes the sales director, then there's no way you can stay at Lubao.

292
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,250
Even if I can't stay, I can still go to other companies!

293
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:32,460
Based on my ability and resources, what job can I not find?

294
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,140
I also thought that 2 months ago.

295
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36,510
I was as confident in myself then as you are now.

296
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:38,410
Was that useful?

297
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,830
At this point,

298
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,610
I am even willing to be a copywriter,

299
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:48,370
yet still no companies want me.

300
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:51,110
President Guo wanted you.

301
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,590
Can we not talk about that?

302
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,230
Really.

303
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:21,900
It's only after...

304
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,120
you really lose your job,

305
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,430
that you realize...

306
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:28,160
that this market

307
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:31,360
isn't what you thought it was,

308
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,940
and you yourself

309
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:36,110
aren't what you imagined yourself to be.

310
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:56,760
Sister Ziru asked us to dinner tonight.

311
00:27:58,150 --> 00:27:59,840
I won't go.

312
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:03,690
I have a video conference with Zhu Xiaobai and them tonight.

313
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,400
Are you really leaving?

314
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:14,560
I only have this much self-confidence left.

315
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:17,660
And a little bit of self-respect.

316
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,300
I want to...

317
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,920
I want to protect that.

318
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,820
I don't want...

319
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,550
I don't want to continue to waste my time in Shanghai,

320
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:29,430
and use up money without having any income.

321
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:32,530
If this is how it's going to be then,

322
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:34,070
why don't I take a step back?

323
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:36,950
The sky and sea are boundless, right?

324
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:03,680
Xiaoling,

325
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,520
you have a lot of things.

326
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,110
You have 88 pairs of shoes. Are you a centipede? Can you wear them all?

327
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,240
It's none of your business.

328
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,320
I spend my own money, buy my own shoes, and walk my own path.

329
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:17,880
What are you doing?

330
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:21,390
I have to go in your car. These are all my babies.

331
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:24,430
I didn't agree to take you to your new house.

332
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:32,090
How about you beg me?

333
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:34,480
I'll be benevolent.

334
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:41,410
All right.

335
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:47,130
I'll be a nice person until the end.

336
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:49,820
- Here, seatbelt. 
 - Hey, I'll do it myself.

337
00:29:55,950 --> 00:30:03,000
 Timing & Subtitles by My Dear Myself Team @Viki.com 

338
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:11,460
Okay, this is the last box.

339
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:22,000
I'm so exhausted.

340
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,450
Just this little bit of work.

341
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:28,010
What do you mean by "a little bit of work"?

342
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:30,630
Your makeup alone is probably about 20 catty. 
 (T/N:  catty = 1¹/₃ pounds, about 600 grams)

343
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:34,190
Not to mention your shoes and bags.

344
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:37,320
Enough. I'll treat you to a meal in a bit, all right?

345
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:43,850
Let's not go out for dinner.

346
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:47,470
I can start the fire and help you warm up the place.

347
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:50,730
You can just cook two of your best dishes for me.

348
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:52,340
Okay.

349
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:55,750
My specialty is boiling water.

350
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:59,990
Then I guess we should go out to eat.

351
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:03,770
Okay. You choose the place, and I'll pay.

352
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:06,410
Okay, go out for a second. I'm going to change clothes and then I'll be out.

353
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:07,610
Just change your clothes here,

354
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:11,460
I won't watch. I'll close my eyes. I won't look at you.

355
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:12,650
Hurry and get out.

356
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:14,840
Believe in my character, I won't look at you.

357
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:19,000
- I need to change. You get out! 
 - If I really go out, people will think I'm having an affair with you.

358
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,160
Go to the bathroom and change.

359
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:30,500
Helping you move is so exhausting, can't you be nicer?

360
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:41,100
Xiaoling,

361
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:45,590
we can go and have street food later.

362
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:47,750
Not a Michelin-starred restaurant.

363
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:50,700
Don't wear 10cm heels.

364
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,660
8cm is fine.

365
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,580
Also, your precious bags.

366
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:57,990
Don't carry your Chanel and Gucci.

367
00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:01,300
Or else, you will blame me if they got splashed by oil.

368
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,130
Are you going out with me like this?

369
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:08,590
What?

370
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:11,180
Isn't this too casual?

371
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:13,490
Don't you usually do makeup or something?

372
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:16,850
That depends on who I'm going with. I'm going with you, so there's no need.

373
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:19,320
Gu Xiaoling, nobody will marry you if you are snobbish like this.

374
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,300
I don't need you to worry about that.

375
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,340
What if I need to be responsible for you in the end?

376
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:26,130
No, you won't be needed.

377
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:28,330
Let's go.

378
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:32,680
Why don't you understand what I'm saying?

379
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,880
Hurry!

380
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,690
Siyu,

381
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:59,580
I ordered a soup for you. It's good for the stomach.

382
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,690
Sister Ziru,

383
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:05,760
how did you know my stomach was not good?

384
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,550
If a saleswoman's stomach is fine,

385
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:10,750
then her sales performance is definitely not good.

386
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,150
- You get me. 
 - Drink it while it's warm.

387
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,040
Hey, Siyu.

388
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:33,460
I remember last time President Pan told me

389
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,890
that there are another two companies in talks about equity financing with him.

390
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:38,820
What were those two companies called again?

391
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:45,310
They're on the tip of my tongue, I just can't remember.

392
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:47,330
That happens to me often as well.

393
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,550
GM Pan didn't talk to you about those companies?

394
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:56,220
I only really talk to GM Pan about sales.

395
00:33:56,220 --> 00:34:00,120
He usually doesn't tell me about this type of thing.

396
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,730
Oh.

397
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:07,390
What did he say to you after we met last time?

398
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:11,950
He didn't say anything.

399
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:17,850
Is the soup good?

400
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:20,680
Yes, it's quite good.

401
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:28,210
You look very down today.

402
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:31,280
Did you get in touch with everyone on the list of names that I gave you last time?

403
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:38,750
I went through it.

404
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:40,840
There are three of them with intentions of cooperating.

405
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:45,000
That's great. Are your sales performance well then?

406
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,380
What wrong? Is it not enough?

407
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:53,020
It's fine. I'll have Annie organize another list for you.

408
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:57,460
Sister Ziru, thank you.

409
00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:01,930
I don't think I'll be able to use your client lists.

410
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:04,880
What happened?

411
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:09,160
My competition with Sister Yuan...

412
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,460
ended early.

413
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:15,320
Wasn't it for 3 months? It hasn't been 3 months yet.

414
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:17,760
I've already lost.

415
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,750
Why?

416
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:22,920
- Be careful. 
 - Please come in.

417
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,630
Your specialties. Each type, one dozen.

418
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:27,540
- Little spicy. 
 - Super spicy.

419
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:30,270
And four bottles of beer.

420
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:35,600
Four bottles between the two of us?

421
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:39,380
I only ordered for myself. Order more yourself if you want some.

422
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:41,750
You are amazing.

423
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:48,210
What are you looking at? Have you never seen such a pretty girl before?

424
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,450
Are you still Gu Xiaoling?

425
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:00,920
What do you mean?

426
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,370
Gosh, you aren't normally like this.

427
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:05,940
Then how am I normally?

428
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:08,330
You are a goddess in my eyes.

429
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:10,990
You are a bit goddess—

430
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:16,450
Think before you speak. Or else, I'll poke you with these skewers.

431
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:20,230
What I mean is... Aren't you normally elegant and cold?

432
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:24,210
You are a bit rou... comfort!

433
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:28,200
I'm feeling very comfortable today.

434
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,210
I'm feeling very comfortable.

435
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:35,150
It's good to feel comfortable. I'm surrounded by beautiful and rich ladies normally.

436
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:36,880
I feel nothing.

437
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,930
Because they can never make me comfortable.

438
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:41,830
Okay, okay. Stop acting.

439
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:44,990
Don't you get tired of acting like a rich second generation heir all day?

440
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:47,440
I'm tired.

441
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,350
So tired.

442
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:51,400
You don't even know how tired I am.

443
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,800
Every day when I go home, I lie on my bed...

444
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,720
I need to gain new insights through reviewing old material.

445
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:00,560
I have to think, "did my lines today...

446
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,530
have any holes in them"?

447
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:06,000
"What kind of story should I tell tomorrow?"

448
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,150
You tell me, wouldn't I be tired that way?

449
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,420
Help me.

450
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:16,680
You can't even open a beer?

451
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:19,720
Amazing!

452
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,710
In the field of new energy batteries,

453
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:29,770
when it comes to cost performance,

454
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:33,320
there is basically no products that can compete with Lubao.

455
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:37,470
So no matter who goes, he/she will get the order.

456
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:51,720
Siyu, I feel

457
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,670
that your competition with Yuan Huizhong hasn't ended yet.

458
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:57,030
Under President Pan's personal interrogation,

459
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:59,660
the results were the same.

460
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:01,670
Do you think I still have a chance?

461
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:04,010
Everything is possible.

462
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,760
Based on my working experience,

463
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:10,290
as long as it isn't the final moment, I won't admit defeat.

464
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:13,930
As long as I don't admit defeat, then I still have a chance to turn the situation around.

465
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:21,300
Sister Ziru, what do you think I should do?

466
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,520
First, tell me about your loss this time.

467
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,370
In what way did you lose?

468
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:31,880
I think I didn't lose in terms of capabilities.

469
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:35,300
I lost for being indecisive.

470
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:37,650
In actuality, I was just soft-hearted.

471
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:42,060
Siyu, you have the wrong idea.

472
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:44,450
I must correct you.

473
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:49,880
Decisiveness is a capability, isn't it?

474
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:52,610
A little girl being softhearted,

475
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:57,090
it means she is kind. She values her friends.

476
00:38:57,090 --> 00:38:59,550
That is a very good virtue.

477
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:01,530
But in the workplace,

478
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:03,950
especially in the managerial position,

479
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:06,080
this is not a good trait.

480
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,980
The workplace only looks at your performance.

481
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:10,660
Your performance needs you to have a shrewd and calm mind,

482
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:12,930
and decisiveness.

483
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:20,230
What you mean is I'm not professional enough?

484
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:23,410
At least in your competition with Sister Yuan,

485
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:27,760
your positioning is not high enough. You are too softhearted and emotional.

486
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:32,240
But people are sentimental and have emotion!

487
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:36,090
But mature people are more rational.

488
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:42,580
You only care about your friendship but don't care about the company's development,

489
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:45,890
then do you also not care about your subordinates and your livelihood?

490
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:54,730
Siyu, I'm not saying being sentimental is not good.

491
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:58,030
But to be an outstanding professional manager,

492
00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:00,670
you must be rational and calm at all times.

493
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:02,950
For the company's development,

494
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:05,550
for the success of a career, you even need to be cold-hearted.

495
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:08,690
But only by doing this, you can go higher and further.

496
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:14,320
Sister Ziru, what you said...

497
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:17,760
I don't know if I can do it or not.

498
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,760
If you want to realize your dream,

499
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,790
then work hard in this area.

500
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:27,660
You will suffer but you will benefit from it eventually.

501
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:38,360
To survive in the workplace is actually easy.

502
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:42,850
Do what you need to do in your position.

503
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:47,260
Don't let the company down. Don't let yourself down.

504
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,930
Do you want to add more food?

505
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:07,080
Waitress, add another order of intestines!

506
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:10,620
What's wrong?

507
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:15,110
Intestines don't fit your image at all.

508
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:17,080
But I like it.

509
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:21,130
Let me tell you. I have loved to eat intestines since I was young.

510
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:23,610
Your taste...

511
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:25,670
is not only strong but also greasy.

512
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:27,590
It's all because of my dad.

513
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:32,060
When I was young, my dad took me to eat intestines in the street every week.

514
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:35,820
Next time, I will take you to enjoy the best-brined intestines in Shanghai.

515
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:38,700
But he died when I was 8 years old.

516
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:44,970
When did your mom marry Li Siyu's dad?

517
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:46,940
When I was 12 years old.

518
00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:52,620
Actually my stepfather treats my mom and me very well.

519
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:56,040
The life before that

520
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:03,870
was too miserable.

521
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:06,380
It was all because we didn't have money.

522
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:13,550
How nice it would be if I could get to know you at that time.

523
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,660
Who I wanted to meet at that time was not you!

524
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,830
Who?

525
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:22,530
I really liked watching "Meteor Garden" when I was young,

526
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:26,540
I thought I was the girl in the drama and I was waiting for my boy every day.

527
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:29,390
Guess what I watched when I was young.

528
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:32,040
- Doraemon? 
 - No.

529
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:35,310
“Youth and Danger.”
 (T/N: a gangster movie from Hong Kong.)

530
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:38,390
That movie laid the foundation for my dreams!

531
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:40,690
You even have dreams?

532
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:43,480
Of course. I want to make a lot of money,

533
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:46,250
I wanted to be a gangster boss. Thinking about it now, it seems silly.

534
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:49,620
But at that time I vowed, if I become successful one day,

535
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:54,600
I will go to Macau. I'm natural and unrestrained. My friendship is priceless.

536
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:57,340
I wish your dream to come true.

537
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,720
- Here, cheers to our dreams. 
 - Cheers!

538
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:15,980
President Liang, I'm sorry. I'm only just now returning your call.

539
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:19,500
Don't worry. I will take care of your order very well.

540
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:22,560
Manager Tang, I've already signed off on the contract.

541
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:26,450
I'll send it out tomorrow. When you come to Shanghai, I'll treat you to a meal.

542
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:28,620
President Xu, I'm so sorry.

543
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:31,900
I had something come up unexpectedly yesterday, so I didn't have time to respond to you.

544
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:35,520
If it's convenient for you, I'll go visit you at 11:00 a.m. tomorrow.

545
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:38,850
Okay. Then I'll see you tomorrow morning.

546
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:47,570
Just now, Zhu Xiaobai called, asking me when I can go back. 

547
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:49,780
 Have you thought about it?

550
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:09,900
♫  How are you?  ♫

551
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:13,600
♫  Listen to me about the latest news  ♫

552
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:18,120
♫  Some sweet and some hopeless  ♫

553
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:22,990
♫  There are also some that were never said  ♫

554
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:26,600
♫  It's been so long, I've already learned to let go  ♫

555
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:31,160
♫  Let go of obsessions, of the present, and of greed  ♫

556
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:36,320
♫  Yet I've never thought of letting you go  ♫

557
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:39,670
♫  Yeah…  ♫

558
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:42,930

559
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,260
♫  En…  ♫

560
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:45,820
♫  Letting go…  ♫

561
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:49,420
♫  Dear Myself  ♫

562
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:52,390
♫  Listen to the voice inside  ♫

563
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:56,520
♫  In this lonely world, be cautious ♫

564
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:58,770
 After we're hurt, we learn to cherish  ♫

565
00:44:58,770 --> 00:45:02,100
♫  Dear Myself  ♫

566
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:05,450
♫  Use all your strength  ♫

567
00:45:05,450 --> 00:45:09,770
♫  Missing the simple you from the past  ♫

568
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:11,910
♫  Turn difficulties into courage  ♫

569
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:16,760
♫  Don't back down from the crowd  ♫

570
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:19,190
♫  Growth is inevitably accompanied by setbacks  ♫

571
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:21,900
♫  The best way to overcome difficulties is to smile  ♫

572
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:23,960
♫  All the punishment given by fate, are you afraid?  ♫

573
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:26,180
♫  Let everything go, all those concerns, real or fake  ♫

574
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:29,260
♫  Cannot erase the scar, but it's just a scar  ♫

575
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:31,010
♫  We are so small yet so determined  ♫

576
00:45:31,010 --> 00:45:32,610
♫  Occasionally fussy and occasionally firm  ♫

577
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:35,160
♫  If growth leaves a trace, then the trace is left be tears  ♫

578
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:38,780
♫  Your back that I've always been chasing  ♫

579
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:41,020
♫  Finally turned around to hug me tightly  ♫

580
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:44,620
♫  It's still that familiar you  ♫

581
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:47,940
♫  Yeah..  ♫

582
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:52,010
♫  Oh..  ♫

583
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:57,400
♫  Dear Myself  ♫

584
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:00,700
♫  Listen to the voice inside  ♫

585
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:04,710
♫  I'll give you the warm that the wind took  ♫

586
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:07,160
♫  Hugging you, hugging me  ♫

587
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:10,490
♫   Dear Myself  ♫

588
00:46:10,490 --> 00:46:14,510
♫  The sky has finally cleared  ♫

589
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:17,870
♫  We've never been so clear-headed  ♫

590
00:46:17,870 --> 00:46:19,920
♫  Looking for the past me who  ♫

591
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:23,450
♫  Ran forward without evading anything  ♫

592
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:26,690
♫  Ran forward without evading anything  ♫

593
00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:29,650
♫  Listen to the voice inside  ♫

594
00:46:29,650 --> 00:46:34,440
♫  The sky has finally cleared  ♫
