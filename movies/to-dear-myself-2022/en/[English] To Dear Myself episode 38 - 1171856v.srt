[To Dear Myself]

3
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:34,050
[Episode 38]

4
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:38,380
No!

5
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:41,820
Pink represents princesses.

6
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:46,100
You haven't called in two years now you suddenly come up with this requirement, don't you feel you've gone too far?

7
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,810
Princess!

8
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:50,330
I said you went too far!

9
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:53,360
Little Queen.

10
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,680
Here. Little Princess.

11
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,300
I want to eat dessert!

12
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,110
- Come here. 
 - I want an ice jelly dessert. 
 (T/N: relative to Korea's "patbingsu" - instead of shaved ice they use a clear jelly and toppings)

13
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:03,180
I want to eat candy!

14
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,780
You can't go there.

15
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:08,180
You are allergic to peanuts, so you can't eat an ice jelly dessert. Okay?

16
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:11,460
You already have cavities. You can't eat candy, okay?

17
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:17,240
Let's do this. Who can make dad laugh can have ice cream!

18
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,630
Okay! Okay!

19
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,620
Dad! Laugh!

20
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:28,970
- Laugh! 
 - What are you doing, Yuwei? Shanshan?

21
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:30,860
Laugh, laugh, laugh!

22
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:34,590
What are you doing? Yuwei, what are you doing?

23
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,070
Are you making a face?

24
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:37,970
He laughs!

25
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:43,260
Ice cream! Ice cream!

26
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,790
What are these two babies doing?

27
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,790
They want to have ice cream!

28
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:49,410
Then take them to have ice cream! Let's go!

29
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:51,400
Yeah! Go!

30
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,930
Ice cream!

31
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:06,440
Auntie, where is my dad?

32
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,540
He went to participate in the senior choir.

33
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,100
Okay.

34
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,830
I heard that you rejected that Xiao Wen?

35
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,800
You already know.

36
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,600
I saw Auntie Lou.

37
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,270
She said Xiao Wen took you to see a house. He is so sincere!

38
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:27,270
How can you not cherish him?

39
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:30,020
We are not the same type of people.

40
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,700
Are you smart or stupid?

41
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:37,090
You don't want Xiao Wen? So many people desire him!

42
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,550
Everyone thinks differently.

43
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:43,800
I planned this for you! You are not young.

44
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,940
If you don't get married soon, you can only marry those who have been divorced.

45
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,220
Auntie, I know you did it for my sake.

46
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:56,660
But I can handle it myself.

47
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:02,320
Look at you!  You are so smart but you just can't figure things out.

48
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:06,050
Luckily, I held back one.

49
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:13,200
Go to meet Uncle Jiang's nephew this weekend.

50
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,440
Also, Chairman Hong's student.

51
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,820
Both have good qualities.

52
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:37,880
What are you thinking about? Let's have dinner together.

53
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:42,080
- I need to accompany my parents this evening. 
 - You are with them every day.

54
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,410
You left your pretty girlfriend alone. That's dangerous.

55
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:48,630
Shut up.

56
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,900
She still hasn't met your parents?

57
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,270
No.

58
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:59,020
Liu Yang, why are you so blunt?

59
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,370
Can you be more poetic?

60
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:03,060
Ignore him.

61
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,030
Perhaps she is afraid? Your relationship is a little complicated.

62
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,960
You can't have her be afraid.

63
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,440
Women are all empowered by men.

64
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,830
♪ I wish you give an affirmation  ♪

65
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:28,110
♪ Then my love is meaningful  ♪

66
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:32,140
So we should sing more in a karaoke.

67
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:36,020
Go! Let's go to a karaoke tonight.

68
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,010
I need to take care of Yuwei.

69
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:40,520
Why do you take care of kids every day?

70
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,810
Zhizhi is busy. I have time.

71
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:47,680
Did you two divorce?

72
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,370
Should I show you my divorce certificate?

73
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:55,850
You wear your wedding ring every day and continue to be single.

74
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:59,840
How come I feel that you fell for Zhizhi more than before?

75
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,770
You are right. This is how I feel for Zhizhi now.

76
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:08,630
How about her?

77
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,930
She cares less and less about me.

78
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:17,290
That's not okay.

79
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:19,860
You need to take action.

80
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,700
What do you mean?

81
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,670
What does Zhizhi like?

82
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:32,890
Without a rose and ring,

83
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:36,170
I married you not knowing everything. 

84
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:38,490
You don't like those.

85
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:41,480
Is there a woman who doesn't like these?

86
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:48,650
Right. I should make up a proposal for her!

87
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:50,330
I can plan for you.

88
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:54,710
Right. Send Yiming. He specializes in proposals. Right?

89
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:56,980
Shut up! Can you stop talking?

90
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,030
No. No.

91
00:06:58,030 --> 00:06:59,930
Shut up, okay? Stop talking.

92
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,460
Okay?

93
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,250
I will shut up.

94
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:14,310
When a kid coughs, you shouldn't use medicine to relieve a cough first. You should reduce phlegm first.

95
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:17,980
Right? I see. Every time Sushan coughs, it lasts very long.

96
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,860
It seems that I didn't give her the right medicine.

97
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:24,400
I will send you some medicine that works well on Yuwei.

98
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,730
If Sushan coughs again, try those first.

99
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:29,160
Sounds good.

100
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,310
- Dad! 
 - What's wrong?

101
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,250
You made your clothes dirty.

102
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,510
I will do it.

103
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,320
Auntie will help you, okay?

104
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:51,170
Come, baby.

105
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,580
Take it for me, okay?

106
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:58,270
This one, too.

107
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,630
Take this off, okay?

108
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,620
Raise your arm.

109
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,300
Come on.

110
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,420
Give me the milk tea.

111
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,230
Thank you.

112
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,410
Ice cream.

113
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,370
You won't make your clothes dirty this way.

114
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:28,360
I want one, too.

115
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,690
- Here. 
 - Thank you!

116
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,480
Here.

117
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:44,710
I took the wrong one.

118
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,480
Thank you.

119
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,780
Slowly.

120
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,910
You know many tricks!

121
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:02,840
Just a bit of life experiences.

122
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:05,610
Uncle!

123
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:09,120
Can Sushan and I go to look at the fish near the door?

124
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,370
Okay, but you can't exit the main door.

125
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:14,090
- Okay, I know. 
 - Good girl!

126
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,460
I will take you there.

127
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,870
- Thank you. 
 - You are welcome.

128
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:27,720
I saw you were unhappy while answering the phone just now. Was it about work?

129
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,750
It was Sushan's mom.

130
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:37,350
She is going to get married again. She asked Sushan to be her flower girl.

131
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:39,650
I didn't agree and I argued a bit with her.

132
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,470
How long have you been divorced?

133
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:49,610
Three years. When Sushan was one year old, she left with a foreigner.

134
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:54,360
It's not easy for you to take care of a child alone.

135
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,120
It is hard.

136
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:01,560
I'm okay. I just feel sorry for Sushan.

137
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:07,520
As long as the child has people who love her, she won't suffer from injustice.

138
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,950
Do you think so?

139
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:13,210
I feel a bit comforted hearing you say this.

140
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:14,980
I often say this to myself as well.

141
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,520
Thank you.

142
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:20,730
How about you? Why did you divorce?

143
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,800
It's okay. If you don't want to talk about this. I shouldn't have brought this up.

144
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:33,210
It's okay. I'm okay to talk about it.

145
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:39,080
Seen from the outside, I broke up with her dad

146
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,070
because of another person.

147
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:46,800
But now I feel that we had too many problems in the marriage.

148
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,170
I think you are quite perfect.

149
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:57,520
At that time, I only wanted to be a good mom and a good wife wholeheartedly.

150
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,200
But I forgot to be the best version of myself.

151
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:05,160
Until one day, I had to face all the problems myself,

152
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,660
I realized how helpless I was.

153
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:13,970
I didn't have solutions. I needed to start over again.

154
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:20,030
It's not easy for you to work and take care of the child at the same time.

155
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:24,070
Yes. Work is stressful.

156
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:26,150
I was cursed by clients often as well.

157
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,830
I apologize to you again.

158
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:32,250
I was kidding.

159
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,900
You didn't feel stressed today, did you?

160
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,290
Today, I'm very happy.

161
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:38,010
I'm also happy.

162
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:08,900
Where are you, Li Siyu?

163
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,500
I miss you, Sister.

164
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:23,190
I don't have a pond.

165
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:27,160
I only have this beach.

166
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,800
Be the only sand sculpture on my beach 
 (T/N: "sand sculpture" means stupid people or behavior on Chinese internet.)

167
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,550
Okay?

168
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,650
Sand sculpture!

169
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:44,910
Li Siyu...

170
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,700
Li Siyu, where are you now?

171
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,700
I think I miss you. I miss you so much!

172
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:57,300
I miss you so much! You made me wait for so long.

173
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,690
Show up quickly!

174
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:03,540
Psycho!

175
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,030
Li Siyu,

176
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,380
I want to be your cold medicine.

177
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:16,440
I even prepared this for you.

178
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:22,780
When on earth will you come to hug me?

179
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,860
Quickly come to hug me!

180
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:52,460
You scared me.

181
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,700
Why are you here?

182
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:58,520
Even though Tianyuan's investment is not more than 30%,

183
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:01,490
I am willing to give you 100% of me.

184
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:03,590
What do you mean?

185
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:08,210
I don't care how you define our relationship, I want to tell you now

186
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,230
that I'm serious.

187
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:15,130
I'm serious without reservation. I'm so serious that I want to gain my parents' approval and blessing.

188
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:20,050
I'm so serious that I hope our relationship will last forever.

189
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,200
Thank you.

190
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:29,090
Me, too.

191
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,220
Ziru, when I am standing next to you,

192
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:38,290
in all aspects, I can't compare with you.

193
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:42,740
But there is one thing that I won't have less than you.

194
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:45,290
It's my sincerity.

195
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:50,200
No.

196
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:55,020
- I have my own problems... 
 - If you are worried about our age gap,

197
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,880
if you are worried about my parents' opinion,

198
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,710
I can tell you clearly now, I don't care.

199
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,070
Even if they are my closest persons,

200
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,400
they can't affect my love for you.

201
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,130
In a few days, my parents will leave Shanghai.

202
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,220
Before they leave,

203
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:36,350
I will take them to have some authentic Shanghai cuisine.

204
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:39,200
I will send you the address.

205
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:44,570
If you can come, it will be great.

206
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,900
But if you can't make it, it's also okay.

207
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,900
I respect your choice.

208
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:58,600
Okay.

209
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:01,890
I will think about it.

210
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:09,840
Hello?

211
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:11,760
You didn't work overtime today?

212
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:14,420
Am I Zhang Zhizhi? I don't work overtime every day.

213
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,340
What are you doing now?

214
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:20,010
Staying home alone and feeling lonely.

215
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,590
You are not with He Mu?

216
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:26,390
He goes to bed at 10:15. I can't disturb him.

217
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,140
How are you doing with Xiao Wen?

218
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,810
I made it clear to him.

219
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:34,580
- So quick! 
 - I'm always a doer.

220
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,380
Don't be happy too early.

221
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:38,450
I heard from my mom that

222
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,600
she planned bigger things for you.

223
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:45,420
You mean the birthday party of the granddaughter of Third Uncle?

224
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,730
Yes!

225
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:51,600
It's too difficult for me. It's annoying me.

226
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,370
Something can annoy Li Siyu?

227
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,800
I'm done.

228
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,810
Think of solutions for me!

229
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:06,500
If you can find a boyfriend, you will mess up my mom's plan.

230
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,020
Where can I find one? That's even more difficult.

231
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:11,470
Did I say you have to find a real one?

232
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:13,900
Listen to me. There will be a way to work it out.

233
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,000
What do you mean?

234
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,220
I will send Lei Haowen to you at that time.

235
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:22,130
It's easy for you to say this. Does Lei Haowen listen to you?

236
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,840
You don't need to worry about this.

237
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,660
Is this nice?

238
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,680
It's pretty good.

239
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,790
Give me one pair as well.

240
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,900
What?

241
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:37,770
I've just finished acting as your ex-boyfriend.

242
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:41,190
Now I have to act as Li Siyu's current boyfriend.

243
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:43,770
Can you ask someone else?

244
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,400
You can't only shear one sheep, right?

245
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,120
Your acting skill is the best.

246
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,700
Go away.

247
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:56,200
You are an underdog actor to win the oscar.

248
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,700
I'm also a popular veteran actor.

249
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,100
Right.

250
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:03,700
The rich second generation you acted was even more real than the real ones.

251
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:08,460
Didn't you say I'm a fake one?

252
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,810
You already promoted!

253
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:17,520
Come on. You are just making use of me.

254
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:19,540
Lei Haowen!

255
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:22,270
Don't be so shameless! Are you helping me or not?

256
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,800
Yes!

257
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,820
I'll remember this!

258
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:36,250
Next Friday. You show up at the birthday celebration of the Third Uncle's granddaughter.

259
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:39,220
Drive a nice car. At least over ¥500,000.

260
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,410
If you don't have one, go borrow one. If you don't have anyone to borrow, then rent one.

261
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:43,570
Is the Porsche from last time okay?

262
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:47,220
No! It's too flashy. My parents won't like it.

263
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:50,590
- Your parents? 
 - Li Siyu's parents.

264
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:55,790
Get a brand name bag. But not the ones that's everywhere.

265
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,600
Do you have any requirements on the brand?

266
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,300
Not low-key international first-tier brand.

267
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:08,150
Car. Bag. I get it.

268
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:12,520
Also, your hair and clothes, change a bit.

269
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:16,650
- Also, change your family background. 
 - How?

270
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:19,330
Young talent. Back from overseas.

271
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:22,950
Do I need to be more? I'm already young and talented!

272
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:25,320
Young talent.

273
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:31,850
Your mom is your mom. Li Siyu's dad is her dad. Right?

274
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,000
Yes.

275
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,080
Sit. Sit.

276
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:48,960
When will you arrive?

277
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:54,730
Feel free to sit.

278
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:56,510
In five minutes.

279
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:58,250
Sit.

280
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,280
Siyu!

281
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,130
People are all here. Dishes can be served.

282
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,400
Let's wait. Someone hasn't arrived.

283
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:11,320
Who?

284
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,370
My boyfriend.

285
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:17,250
I didn't know that.

286
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,600
Nor did I.

287
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,600
You have boyfriend?

288
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,100
Since when?

289
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,870
- Why didn't we know this? 
 - I didn't know as well.

290
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,400
Her parents didn't know as well.

291
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,730
Because we haven't confirmed our relationship before.

292
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:32,000
So I didn't report to you.

293
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:35,550
- Where does he from? 
 - What does he do?

294
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,300
How is his financial condition?

295
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:38,680
Is he a nice person?

296
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,650
He will arrive very soon.

297
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,790
He can answer all of your questions by himself.

298
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:42,490
Good!

299
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,200
We will test him well.

300
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,430
We will test him well as the family seniors.

301
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:48,500
- Okay. 
 - Siyu.

302
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,300
Everyone,

303
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:53,000
- let me introduce you. This is— 
 - Right.

304
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:57,160
Excuse me. We are late. I will introduce for Siyu,

305
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,800
this is...

306
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:06,200
Hi, everyone, I'm Siyu's boyfriend, Guan Xiaotang.

307
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,580
Nice to meet you all.

308
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:12,030
It's him! Not him!

309
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:51,600
[Yuan Yuan Restaurant]

310
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,160
- Okay. 
 - No problem.

311
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,020
Sit.

312
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:08,180
This is what you like.

313
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:14,160
What's this called?

314
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:15,050
I will try one.

315
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,300
Mom, give the bowl to me. I will give you some eel.

316
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:19,230
This is your mom's favorite.

317
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:22,100
- How can I not know this. 
 - Not too much, okay?

318
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:24,050
Soft heart.

319
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:28,780
- Is it called this? I ate this before. 
 - Did you make this up by yourself?

320
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:30,220
Soft heart.

321
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:35,050
Give me the cup. Have more soup. Drink less juice. It's sweet.

322
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,730
That's all right?

323
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:49,350
What's going on?

324
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,900
Surprised? Good?

325
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,540
How come it's Guan Xiaotang?

326
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:58,610
Lei Haowen's acting is too exaggerated. He is heartless. So I changed him.

327
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,600
I can't find someone else in such a short time.

328
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,740
How did you find him?

329
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,500
He added me on WeChat.

330
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:05,640
How did he add you on WeChat?

331
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:09,730
He is good at technology. It's easy for him to find my Wechat.

332
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,100
You knew I was trying to hide from him.

333
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,190
Why did you make him come?

334
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:17,530
I like to cross you. I was like this since I was young!

335
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,900
You asked me to go in the east direction, I will insist on going in the west direction.

336
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:24,080
You...

337
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,440
I completely tailor-made this for you according to your requirements.

338
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:31,500
Although Guan Xiaotang is young, he

339
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,500
is really passionate about this role.

340
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:36,590
Gu Xiaoling, don't get caught by me.

341
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:41,000
How about we do a video call? I really want to see your face now.

342
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:54,700
Aunt, this is the present I brought for you.

343
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,300
Thank you. I'm Xiaoling's friend.

344
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,650
I'm called Lei Haowen.

345
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:03,100
- You can call me Haowen. 
 - I got it. I got it. Surname, Lei, first name, Haowen.

346
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,410
Xiaotang,

347
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,600
what does your family do?

348
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:10,840
My dad is in the circulation of recycled materials business.

349
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:15,050
When his business expands, he started to do business in other industries as well.

350
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:20,820
Now he has business in energy, chemical engineering, food, and finance.

351
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,200
Amazing.

352
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:26,810
I'm Lei Haowen.

353
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,800
Don't go too far.

354
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,700
Drive.

355
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,860
Oh my, girls go through many changes growing up.

356
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:13,160
- You're getting pretty and prettier by the day. 
 - Thank you, Eldest Aunt.

357
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:16,420
You're already like the white swan princess.

358
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,500
Hey, Siyu, I'm begging you

359
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:22,210
to take care of the situation with your cousin.

360
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,440
What?

361
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,700
Next year, he will be graduating from college.

362
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:30,790
Help him find a good job at Xiaotang's group.

363
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,290
We can talk about it next year.

364
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:33,640
Hey, Siyu.

365
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:37,520
He's got such great qualities. Whatever you do, don't let him go.

366
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:38,500
I understand.

367
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,040
Guan Xiaotang.

368
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:42,450
- Right? 
 - Yes.

369
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,200
Xiaotang, this kid,

370
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,020
- How much money did my daughter use to invite you here? 
 - is really good.

371
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:50,330
Uncle, I did it for myself.

372
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:53,430
Don't be nervous, I won't reveal it to everyone.

373
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:55,220
I really am not an actor!

374
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,810
- You can't hide it from me. 
 - Uncle,

375
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:00,430
even if you don't trust my information,

376
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,290
you should at least believe in your daughter's charm.

377
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:14,100
You're not my daughter's type.

378
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:20,950
Uncle, but in life, don't you have to try them all?

379
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:26,600
Hey, these words appeal to me!

380
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:28,700
They had a good talk.

381
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:32,710
Siyu, thinking of the rain, I'll drop off Aunt and Uncle. It's quite windy.

382
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,600
You and Director Guan can take a walk over there.

383
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:39,400
Yes, yes, yes. Over there, nearby, is a park. You can walk around there.

384
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,400
- Okay, okat. 
 - I know.

385
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:43,250
Okay, Auntie, Uncle, the wind is very strong. Let's get going.

386
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:45,410
- Be careful. 
 - Siyu, then we're leaving as well.

387
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,460
- Okay, okay. 
 - We're leaving, Director Guan. Have fun.

388
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:48,940
- Stay safe. 
 - All right. 
 - Let's go have fun!

389
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,700
- Take a walk. 
 - We're leaving. Bye!

390
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,440
Hurry!

391
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:57,730
Uncle, be careful.

392
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:04,450
So I passed, didn't I?

393
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,350
Hey! Hey!

394
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:09,680
Your stick-on mustache looks way too fake.

395
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,720
They're not stick-on! They're authentic!

396
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:16,400
Hey!  Tell me the truth. Where did you graduate?

397
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,240
Don't you have my resumé?

398
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,600
You graduated from the Central Academy of Drama, didn't you?

399
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:23,150
You act more convincingly as a rich second generation kid than Lei Haowen does!

400
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:24,630
Who taught you?

401
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:29,330
I wasn't acting. I was being authentic.

402
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,940
You think I don't know you?

403
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,200
Who did you borrow this attire from?

404
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,340
And that car, how much did it cost to rent? I'll transfer the money back to you through WeChat.

405
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,450
- I don't want money. 
 - Then, what do you want?

406
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:43,340
I want you.

407
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:54,200
Go back to Shanghai. Go find yourself a young woman

408
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,300
and get the experience you need. Then you can come and find me.

409
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,800
I'm experienced, okay?

410
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:05,730
Even though I look like young, fresh meat, I'm very mature already, I am!

411
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:08,670
- Let's go. 
 - To do what?

412
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,130
I'm taking you to play in the children's playground.

413
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:17,630
Hurts!

414
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:20,050
I acted for so long for nothing??

415
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:28,230
- Yiming, will we be able to make it? 
 - Yes. 
 - Hurry.

416
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,330
Be careful, careful.

417
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,200
Make sure that's flat.

418
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,000
All right. If this looks okay, you should get in the car.

419
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,080
Get in the car.

420
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,500
- Good. 
 - Yiming? Yiming?

421
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:55,360
This is Uncle and Auntie, yes?

422
00:28:56,780 --> 00:29:01,010
Uncle, Auntie, I'm Yiming's... friend.

423
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,200
My name is Wang Ziru.

424
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,200
Originally, Yiming said to have lunch with you.

425
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:09,330
But I was in a meeting and could not make it. I'm so sorry.

426
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:10,880
It's fine, it's fine.

427
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:17,010
I know that you two are going to catch the train this afternoon, so I had to come and send you off. Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to forgive myself.

428
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,880
It's fine. You're busy.

429
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:25,720
Uncle and Auntie, I prepared some little gifts for the two of you.

430
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:27,980
- Uncle. Auntie. 
 - That's too sweet of you. 
 - Too kind of you.

431
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:30,760
- I'm sorry. Thank you. 
 - Thanks.

432
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:32,800
I need to rush back to the company for a meeting.

433
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,600
I cannot send you to the train station.

434
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,000
It's fine. You can attend to your work.

435
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:40,400
Yiming, get in the car. Don't waste any more time.

436
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,300
- Okay. Come on, Dad and Mom.  
 - See you.

437
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:45,800
Bye, Uncle. Bye, Auntie.

438
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,480
Be careful when driving!

439
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:02,850
- We're leaving. 
 - Be careful.

440
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:33,750
Look!

441
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,370
- I can't even sit in it! 
 - You look like it.

442
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:39,100
What do you mean, I look like it?

443
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:40,580
Enjoy it properly, okay?

444
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:44,960
Older Sister Director Li!

445
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,700
Go play. Doesn't it suit you so well?

446
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:50,960
If you want me to play, then I will.

447
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:56,870
Come back to Shanghai with me.

448
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:01,780
Since I came back here, I don't plan to go back.

449
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,910
That's enough.

450
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:07,420
You're naturally formidable, but you've gotten bullied in the workplace.

451
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:10,080
Maybe you don't feel wronged, but I feel embarrassment for you.

452
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,650
I think it's nice.

453
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:14,330
Can you even do it?

454
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,690
When we first met, you hit and scolded me!

455
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:20,180
You can't change it!  It's your personality.

456
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:30,130
I know that in your mind, you've never been able to get past Laidianle and Lubao.

457
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:33,900
Isn't it just taking down two companies? It's fine.

458
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:37,180
Later, we can take down a few more companies then you won't feel so bad.

459
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,200
Are you asking to be hit again?

460
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,950
Look! You're so violent.

461
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,750
That's the true you, right?

462
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:59,100
Yiming, who was that woman?

463
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,450
Didn't he say already? We weren't going to discuss it.

464
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:06,170
Well, can't I at least ask? We don't have to discuss it.

465
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:08,780
If you want to ask, then ask.

466
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:12,340
Where is Xiao Wang from? What do her parents do?

467
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:16,680
Yiming, this present was sent straight to my heart.

468
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:23,230
The inscription on it is of Liquan in Jiucheng Palace.

469
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,910
I love this bracelet so much!

470
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,560
It such good quality.

471
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:31,940
It's real.

472
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,190
Hey, let me try it.

473
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:38,240
The inscription on it is of Liquan in Jiucheng Palace.

474
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:40,500
I've been thinking about it for a long time.

475
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,000
I put it on. It's nice, it's nice. Take a look!

476
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:47,420
- Just take a look. Is it good? 
 - Yes, it's pretty.

477
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,900
So nice.

478
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,700
This is...

479
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:06,660
How did you know what my parents liked?

480
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:19,150
I saw the pictures you sent out on WeChat moments.

481
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:23,710
Your father has many inscriptions, your mother likes jewelry.

482
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,910
Well, did I guess correctly?

483
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:30,990
You did.

484
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:35,950
My parents loved them and were very happy.

485
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,380
In truth, you had no meetings.

486
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:45,110
By using the method of sending them off,

487
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:50,100
you cut short a meeting that could have been very awkward.

488
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:53,860
At the same time, you left them a very deep impression of you.

489
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:59,950
Are you blaming me?

490
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,920
Yiming.

491
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:11,480
I can predict the trend of stocks.

492
00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:13,930
I can also control many things.

493
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,700
When it comes to love, I'm useless.

494
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:22,300
I'm also uncertain.

495
00:34:25,410 --> 00:34:27,480
Yiming,

496
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:34,750
It's not that I don't care...or don't want a future with you.

497
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,220
I just don't know what to do.

498
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:55,250
I know.

499
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,890
Actually talking about love,

500
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:03,510
I also have lots to fear.

501
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:06,460
We can learn together.

502
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,420
Make efforts together.

503
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,210
Okay.

504
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:15,500
Let's make efforts together.

505
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:34,310
I hope one day that we can meet them leisurely.

506
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:40,590
You should give me some time.

507
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:44,180
Yes.

508
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:47,280
Yiming,

509
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:52,190
I hope you can also lay down some unnecessary dignity.

510
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:54,970
Help me to rebrand Lubao.

511
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:57,380
Okay?

512
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:04,300
Okay.

513
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:14,380
Aunt, there is too much stuff!

514
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,000
- Too much! We can't eat them all. 
 - We can do it.

515
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,530
- Take back some. 
 - Take them!

516
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,600
Eat this on the way back. They are all our specialty.

517
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:22,640
This is for Xiaoling.

518
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:24,160
I will take them!

519
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,520
- I will take them to Xiaoling. 
 - Ask Xiaoling for me.

520
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:31,240
When will she bring her boyfriend back so we can see?

521
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:35,400
Since they are serious now, they should visit the father-in-law soon!

522
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,970
Serious?

523
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:39,950
Siyu said that man has proposed to her!

524
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:42,050
Xiaoling also said yes.

525
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:45,400
Auntie. Dad. Let's talk about Xiaoling later.

526
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,900
The traffic will be worse if they leave any later.

527
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,000
Quickly go.

528
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,520
Be careful on the way back.

529
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,360
- Drive slowly. 
 - We will leave.

530
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,120
- Take care, Auntie and Uncle! 
 - Be careful!

531
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:56,730
I will come back to see you again. Bye, Siyu.

532
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:58,700
Drive slowly!

533
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,680
Money is not the most important.

534
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,560
The most important is that he is nice to you.

535
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:11,390
Xiao Tang, although he is younger than you,

536
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:13,790
he knows to love you and also treat you nicely.

537
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,100
He is the one!

538
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:16,970
I will listen to you, Auntie.

539
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:21,800
But he is in Shanghai. You are here. What are your future plans?

540
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:24,380
Future?

541
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:26,180
We can talk about it later.

542
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:27,690
You can't!

543
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,300
This is a big event! What do you think—

544
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,200
This Guan Xiaotang...

545
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,200
is not mature yet.

546
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:35,710
Siyu is nice to Xiaotang.

547
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:38,830
That is acting for you to see!

548
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,150
What do you mean?

549
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,700
Tell me!

550
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:45,100
Do you still need one? Coming!

551
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:47,230
Old man!

552
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,780
Siyu, I think he is good.

553
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,740
Auntie, let's go back first.

554
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,640
Tell me what's going on.

555
00:37:56,810 --> 00:37:58,890
- I really like that kid. 
 - That's great.

556
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:07,310
Brother Lei, drive slowly. Okay?

557
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,650
I'm afraid to die.

558
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:12,210
I'm still young, Brother Lei!

559
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,600
I have billions of family property to inherit!

560
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,550
Stop!

561
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,630
Let me drive.

562
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:01,510
What do you plan to do, Brother Lei?

563
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,500
I don't know either.

564
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:09,140
It's very urgent. You still don't know what to do?

565
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:10,620
Show your trump card.

566
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:17,950
I don't have one.

567
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,650
Who said?

568
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:21,250
True love is obtainable.

569
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:40,630
- Step back a little. 
 - A little back.

570
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:48,790
I can't do it. I'm exhausted.

571
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,980
You two continue.

572
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,460
Step a bit back.

573
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,830
Is it okay?

574
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:11,230
The two of them get along quite well.

575
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:13,080
Yes. It's rare.

576
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:19,930
- Yuwei's mom, 
 - Yes?

577
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,170
do you feel that...

578
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:25,530
we two get along well as well?

579
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:29,050
Perhaps it's because of the kids.

580
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:34,590
Our personalities are also similar, right?

581
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:41,390
I will go straight to my point.

582
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:44,620
Being with you,

583
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:50,140
I feel very assured and warm.

584
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:55,910
When we return from Disneyland the last time,

585
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,450
I've been thinking about one thing.

586
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:05,760
If we four can make a family together,

587
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:08,710
we will be very happy.

588
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,800
What do you think?

589
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:29,810
Sushan's dad.

590
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:32,060
You can call me Lixing in the future.

591
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:35,920
If I may, I will call you Zhizhi.

592
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:42,650
I haven't considered this.

593
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:47,490
I brought this up today, so you can have time to think it over.

594
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:55,660
-But— 
 - Don't rush to answer me right away.

595
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:59,060
Spend some time thinking about it, right?

596
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:00,770
Is it okay?

597
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:20,810
See you.

598
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:27,240
Xiaoling!

599
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:36,200
I almost forgot to give this to you.

600
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,560
What's this?

601
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,140
To guarantee our rights,

602
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:45,250
to guarantee our wedding can be conducted smoothly and to make sure our marriage lasts long and stable,

603
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:47,600
I drafted a prenuptial agreement.

604
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:52,700
So heavy?

605
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:54,040
Nine chapters altogether.

606
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,690
23 items. 347 clauses.

607
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:01,420
Including politics, economy, religion, psychological education, and so on.

608
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:06,000
It also plans different stages such as pre-marriage, the wedding, and the duration of the marriage.

609
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:09,650
Say it again?

610
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:14,100
I hope you can sign this agreement before we start to plan our wedding.

611
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:17,380
Are you getting married or establishing diplomatic relations?

612
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:19,970
Please look at it carefully.

613
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:24,810
I hope we can communicate about this agreement when we have a date next time.

614
00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:26,220
Okay.

615
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:31,400
Then, I'll see you next Wednesday evening at 18:18, at the same place and the same table.

616
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,590
Okay.

617
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,820
[Prenuptial agreement]

618
00:43:58,230 --> 00:44:01,680
What are you doing here? You scared me!

619
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:04,870
You are getting married?

620
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:07,780
You drank alcohol?

621
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,580
Answer me first.

622
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:12,290
It's none of your business!

623
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:14,490
You can't marry that robot.

624
00:44:14,490 --> 00:44:15,830
Why?

625
00:44:15,830 --> 00:44:17,090
Because I like you.

626
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:22,130
But I don't like you.

627
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:25,020
But you don't like him at all.

628
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:30,830
Even if I don't like him,

629
00:44:30,830 --> 00:44:32,890
but it's impossible between us.

630
00:44:32,890 --> 00:44:35,260
Why is it impossible?

631
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:37,930
When you are down, I can drink with you.

632
00:44:37,930 --> 00:44:40,600
When you get into trouble, I can solve it for you.

633
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:43,880
You can wear slippers without make-up with me.

634
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:45,670
I can make you laugh.

635
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:47,470
I'm willing to be cursed or beaten by you.

636
00:44:47,470 --> 00:44:50,500
When you need me, I won't switch off my phone and go to sleep.

637
00:44:56,790 --> 00:44:58,170
Do you have money?

638
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:02,500
Do you have a company that is worth hundreds of millions?

639
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:05,810
Can you make me feel secure?

640
00:45:05,810 --> 00:45:07,500
I don't have money now.

641
00:45:07,570 --> 00:45:09,050
But I will have in the future.

642
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:11,770
I'm tired. I want to rest.

643
00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:13,170
Xiaoling.

644
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:14,450
Xiaoling.

645
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:16,350
What are you doing?

646
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:18,000
You can't leave if you don't finish today.

647
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,130
I don't want talk to a drunk person!

648
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:23,650
Xiaoling, if I'm not drunk, I can't say this directly to you.

649
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:25,100
Gu Xiaoling!

650
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:26,980
I love you, Gu Xiaoling.

651
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:31,190
- Can you stay together with me? 
 - Let me go!

652
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:35,200
But I don't love you.
