00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:39,400
My super-rich roommate called his dad immediately once he went back.

5
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,400
"Dad, my classmates all take the subway to school,

6
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm the only one who drives a Ferrari." As soon as his dad heard that, he got anxious.

7
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,400
His dad said,

8
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,400
"Hey, son.

9
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,400
That's not good. We can't let the Europeans look down on us.

10
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,800
How much money is the subway? I'll send you ¥100 million right now. Is that enough?"

11
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,000
Really?

12
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,100
Of course, that's fake.

13
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
But Xiaoling, to be honest, the lifestyle of these foreign new money people,

14
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,800
make me, a Chinese rich guy, feel really shocked.

15
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,000
Really?

16
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,400
My goal right now is to work hard and earn money.

17
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,200
I eventually want to buy my son...

18
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,800
a subway.

19
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,800
Xiaoling,

20
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:33,000
when you smile, you look like the girl painted by Duffy Sheridan.

21
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,600
A little arty.

22
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,800
A little free and easy. But also a little cunning.

23
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,000
Really?

24
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,300
I want to give you a present.

25
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,400
What's is it?

26
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,300
When I was in the park this morning,

27
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:07,390
this leave dropped on me without any cause.

28
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,500
I was thinking at that time,

29
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,800
it is very much like you,

30
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,200
entering my heart without a reason.

31
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,800
So I decided that I must gift it to you.

32
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,400
Thank you.

33
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,800
I will treasure it very well.

35
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,800
Hello, sir. Are you here to look at cars?

36
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,600
Yes, I want to have a look at the cars.

37
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,800
Please come in and I can introduce them to you.

38
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,800
Are you guys even humans?

39
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:52,000
I was dumped! Originally, I thought I got Gu Xiaoling,

40
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,800
but she is ignoring me now.

41
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,200
Reply! Do you have any sympathy?

42
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,400
It's nothing.

43
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,700
Hello, sir. This is the latest Chinese new energy car.

44
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,000
It uses a Lubao battery. The battery life is very long.

45
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,800
It can go 410 kilometers. It's also very quick to charge the battery.

46
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,600
It only takes 1 hour to be fully charged.

47
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:18,360
This here is the production of chargers.

48
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,400
We put the counter electrode

49
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,400
into the battery pack,

50
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,600
then we put it into the water tank to conduct charge-discharge.

51
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,400
Compared with the old technique,

52
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,000
the container formation technique

53
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,700
greatly improves environmental protection.

55
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,700
Yes, Yiming.

56
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,600
What's this?

57
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,100
The valuation of Lubao company is on the higher side

58
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,400
mainly because the future outlook of Lubao 3.0 in the market is very good.

59
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,000
Right now, Lubao 3.0 hasn't entered the market on a large scale.

60
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,800
But I have already done research on the trial customers of Lubao 3.0.

61
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,200
This data can probably help you reevaluate

62
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,900
the future market prospect of Lubao 3.0.

63
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:23,020
Why did you think of doing this research?

64
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,000
Because I believe that you would need this in your next negotiations.

65
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,200
I also took a look at the evaluation of Lubao

66
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:39,000
by the Planning Department. I think it's not very accurate.

67
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,200
So I reevaluated it based on my experience.

68
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,600
This is my evaluation report.

00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,990
I remember I told you,

72
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:05,000
you don't need to take part in this project.

73
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,260
But...

74
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,600
I want to let everyone know

75
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,200
that I'm the Planning Director of Tianye Group now.

76
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:20,000
I have the responsibility and duty to prove my ability

77

78
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:29,370

106
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,000
If anyone were to make a call, it should be him calling home.

 - Aunt!

Oh my god.

180
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,800
We've just finished our preliminary work. Mr. Liu Yang is very happy so he drank a little more than normal.

181
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,400
You should prepare some honey water for him when you guys get back and don't let him get cold.

182
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,800
All right. Thank you.

00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,000
Mom! Let me introduce her to you.

184
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,400
This is my colleague Xiao Yun.

185
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,200
Xiao Yun is really nice.

186
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,600
Hey!

187
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,800
Careful.

188
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,400
Be careful, Brother Yang. I will help you clean the jacket.

189
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
No need. It's okay.

190
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Look. Your shirt is also got dirty.

191
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,800
Do you want to clean it upstairs?

192
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,500
No need. I can clean it when I get home.

193
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:45,400
This is Mr. Liu Yang's bag and phone.

194
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,400
I'll take my leave, Auntie.

195
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,900
Okay.

196
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,800
I won't take you home then.

197
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,600
It's nothing.

198
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,800
Next time when we get the chance,

199
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,800
we'll celebrate alone.

200
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,800
I got it.

201
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,000
Brother Yang, have a good rest.

202
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,800
- I'm leaving now. 
 - Bye!

203
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,300
Sorry for not seeing you out. Thank you.

204
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,600
Hurry up.

205
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,600
Sorry for not sending you off.

206
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,600
Why did you drink so much?

207
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,400
I'm happy!

208
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,400
Why are you so happy?

209
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,200
Let's see how you are going to explain it to your wife.

210
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,870
Come help me.

211
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,200
Slowly, slowly.

212
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,800
I want to drink water.

213
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,500
Quickly get some water for him.

214
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:46,400
Zhang Zhizhi!

215
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,200
I'm going to be promoted to Deputy Director very soon.

216
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,400
You will be the wife of a director!

217
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,800
Yang, are you really getting promoted to Deputy Director?

218
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,700
This is great!

219
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,800
Give him water to drink.

220
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,600
Do you know...

221
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,180
during these years,

222
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,800
how much I've put up with

223
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,900
and how much I've suffered?

224
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,200
But...

225
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,400
you just need to bite your teeth and you'll persist.

226
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,800
That's how I got my accomplishments.

227
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:24,700
You, don't be so sensitive.

228
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,400
Don't be troubled anymore.

229
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,200
Just live your life well.

230
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,000
Yuwei!

231
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,400
Yuwei!

232
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,200
What are you doing?

233
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,400
I need to tell Yuwei this good news.

234
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,400
The kid is asleep.

235
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,400
I can just wake her up.

236
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,200
Who does that as a father?

237
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,600
What's wrong with a dad like me?

238
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:58,200
What I do, I do wrong as a dad?

239
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,910
Let me tell you!

240
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:04,790
I'm the most capable dad in the world!

241
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:08,000
I'm the most capable husband in the world!

242
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I'm the most capable son in the world!

243
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,000
What on earth are you trying to do?

244
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I want to ask Yuwei if I'm the best dad in the world.

245
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,300
I want to ask her if I...

246
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,500
Just go be your director.

247
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,200
Mom!

248
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,600
What's wrong? Baby, go to sleep.

249
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,200
I want dad.

250
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,700
Dad is not back yet.

251
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,600
Wash up.

252
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:03,000
What kind of wife is she? Why did you marry this wife?

253
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,400
She doesn't know how to take care of her husband. She doesn't care about her husband either.

254
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,000
Look at this. Come on. Let's sit up, son.

255
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,800
Liu Yang...

256
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:24,200
Brother Yang, the moment you kissed me, my heart

257
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,000
was already forever with you.

258
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,800
[Delete]

259
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,200
[Delete]

260
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:00,100
Are you done? Let's go.

261
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,000
Here.

262
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,600
Dad and Grandma, bye!

263
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,400
Okay, okay. Bye!

264
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,600
Be careful on the way.

265
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,200
I'm heading to work now.

266
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,400
Sit down.

267
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,100
Sit down.

268
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,600
What's up?

269
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:45,200
Who was the girl who sent you home last night?

270
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,800
My colleague.

271
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,600
Colleague?

272
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,600
From what I see, you care a lot about her.

273
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,200
It's just a normal colleague.

274
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,200
Let me tell you.

275
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,600
Even though I'm not very satisfied with Zhizhi,

276
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,600
she is your wife after all.

277
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,600
Also, there's Yuwei. You need to have integrity.

278
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,200
You can't do any wrong to her. Do you hear me?

279
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,000
I got it. I got it.

280
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,600
I'm going to work.

281
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:35,800
I don't know what I did yesterday. Did I offend you?

282
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:39,000
Brother Yang, you didn't offend me.

283
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:43,100
On the contrary, I feel very happy.

284
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:49,300
I finally know that we share the same feelings.

285
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,900
No. No. No. You may have—

286
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,400
Maybe I made you misunderstand something.

287
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:09,200
As long as you allow me to love you, I don't care about anything else.

288
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,800
That is impossible.

289
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,100
I have a family.

290
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:21,200
I can do anything for you.

291
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,000
Everyone is watching us at work.

292
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,800
-We— 
 - I understand.

293
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,800
I understand.

294
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,800
Don't worry.

295
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:37,000
You can call me Brother Yang. I can call you Sister Yun.

296
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,400
That's it.

297
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,800
That is where the boundary is.

298
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:04,740
Are you trying to lose weight? You are getting so much to eat.

299
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:09,500
This Wolong nut is low fat and also tasty. I eat it for breakfast.

300
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,210
Liu Yang and I are going to play basketball together. Will you come over? Is there anything you want me to tell him? 

301
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:25,560
I'm with Zhizhi. There's no need.

302
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:39,150
Say, he is an art curator

303
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:42,750
and has his own art investment company so he must be rich. Right?

304
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,640
We have known each other for over a month now,

305
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,330
yet he either gives me a leaf or a stone as presents. He even went further the other day. He gave me a button.

306
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:50,480
Button?

307
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:56,580
He took it from his old shirt. He said the button knows his heartbeat so he gave that to me.

308
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:59,930
- It's quite romantic. 
 - But I'm not interested in romance.

309
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:07,120
I like the practical and trending thing. It's even better if it preserves its value. Even if it's tacky, it's fine.

310
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:11,230
What kind of method is there for me to hint at him?

311
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:12,570
Just tell him directly.

312
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:18,820
That won't do. My persona right now is a chic and refined female artist.

313
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,290
Hey, you got so many drinks. Can you finish them?

314
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:37,170
These are like fresh juice. I can take my time to drink them. Artists like me need this.

315
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:45,370
I obviously like money yet I have to pretend not to like it. Don't you think it's hard for me?

316
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:50,360
I think you should properly expose your true nature of worshiping gold.

317
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,920
I'm afraid I will scare him away.

318
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:57,160
If he has money, he won't be scared away. If he is scared away, then he definitely doesn't have money.

319
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,050
That makes sense.

320
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:11,040
Hello. Do you have a membership card?

321
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,380
Zhizhi, membership card.

322
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,550
(What's wrong?)

323
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,450
Zhizhi.

324
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:29,350
Zhizhi, has Liu Yang been bullying you lately?

325
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:35,270
What's wrong?

326
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:48,420
I pick up Yuwei every day.

327
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:53,570
Whenever I see them, I feel disgusted.

328
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:55,650
I feel so upset.

329
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:58,810
I really want to curse at someone. Zhizhi, you are hopelessly stupid.

330
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:00,910
Gu Xiaoling, shut up!

331
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,270
But, Zhizhi,

332
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:09,090
we have to transfer schools. Definitely transfer. Must transfer.

333
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,450
Liu Yang opposes it strongly.

334
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:18,550
He thinks that I'm sensitive, I'm making trouble for no reason, and I'm wasting money.

335
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:24,320
It's nothing to do with the money. It's also not about being sensitive. It's your dignity.

336
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:30,160
That's what I think, too, Sister Siyu. But I can't explain it clearly.

337
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:34,420
How come you can't explain clearly? You are just hopelessly stupid. You don't have—

338
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:41,190
Look at that kindergarten! Full of snobbish people. What good will your daughter learn from it?

339
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,520
Zhizhi, I'm going to say something you may not want to hear.

340
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:56,030
I think it was wrong for you to transfer Yuwei to this high-end kindergarten in the beginning.

341
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:05,490
At that time, I was thinking

342
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:10,130
that as a parent I should give my kid a better environment.

343
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:14,160
I have to send my kid to a higher class.

344
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:19,580
Then, have you thought about if the higher class will accept you or not?

345
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:24,440
Transfer Yuwei back.

346
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:28,160
Even if you will lose about half the tuition money, the school here

347
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:33,150
will be cheaper, right? You can work it out.

348
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:37,580
More importantly, nobody will look down on you. Nobody will bully you.

349
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:41,020
You also don't need to please anyone.

350
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:53,670
I will go through the process of transferring schools tomorrow.

351
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:57,770
In my opinion, Liu Yang is wrong in this matter.

352
00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:00,090
Hey. Don't stir up trouble.

353
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:04,790
How am I stirring up trouble? His wife was bullied by others, yet he can just let it go?

354
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:12,260
It's good enough that you don't get bullied. You're always trying to get into the rich people circle every day. Which one of those people are not snobbish?

355
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:14,150
I just don't understand.

356
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:18,880
I've already successfully persuaded Gu Xiaoling to move into a house one alley from me.

357
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,520
From a psychological perspective, I should be her male best friend. Right?

358
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,890
Say, why is she still dating some curator?

359
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:29,610
Generally speaking, once you entered the friend zone, for the rest of your life,

360
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:32,230
- you won't have a chance. 
 - Why?

361
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:33,840
Give me the ball!

362
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:39,870
Boyfriend, from my perspective, is to layup.

363
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:48,750
A male best friend is different. It's a three-pointer. Even though it's further from the backboard,

364
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:50,630
once you make the shot,

365
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,540
3 points!

366
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,880
I advise you to give up.

367
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,630
Why should I?

368
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:02,310
She is so good-looking.

369
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:05,090
Haowen, don't be obsessed with looks.

370
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:07,920
Look more at the inner beauty of the girl.

371
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:11,430
Her shallow inner beauty

372
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:16,760
matches my flatulent personality very well.

373
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:23,490
Why did you sigh?

374
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:33,500
Xiaoling is right. What hurts me the most is

375
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:41,690
that I have given so much to this family and Yuwei. It's fine that he doesn't understand.

376
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:50,270
But when I am the most hurt, not only did he not care nor support me,

377
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:52,640
but he also thinks it's not an issue at all.

378
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:56,350
- You brought this on yourself. 
 - Xiaoling!

379
00:29:56,350 --> 00:30:01,450
Look at you. You are reluctant to spend money on clothes. You use the cheapest skincare products.

380
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:04,480
You're even reluctant to take a taxi when you go out.

381
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:10,750
You don't even prioritize yourself. How could you expect a man to treat you like treasure?

382
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:17,260
Are you done stirring up trouble? It's not easy for Liu Yang as well!

383
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:21,180
He has to be cautious at work.

384
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:25,380
He has to make some accomplishments while not offending people.

385
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:30,210
He earns a fixed salary. How many problems does he need to fix?

386
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:37,790
What Xiaoling says makes sense as well.

387
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:40,870
Women can't give all of themselves to men.

388
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:43,850
You also must pay some attention to yourself.

389
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:46,660
From now on, don't care about anything.

390
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:49,170
Don't care about Liu Yang or Yuwei.

391
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:56,640
Just make yourself beautiful. I can guarantee that Liu Yang will circle around you.

392
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:03,010
Yuwei is just a kid. How can I not care for her?

393
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:07,560
Also, after having a family, I don't even know where so many problems have come from.

394
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,090
Don't listen to her. Just being pretty is useless.

395
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:16,580
The best solution is to have your own career. Then you won't be overlooked by your husband.

396
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:23,130
I understand everything you've said. It's just...

397
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:28,500
I want to dress up. I also want my own career.

398
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:36,330
But after having a family and a kid, you can only imagine those things.

399
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:41,600
As long as you are willing, nothing is impossible.

400
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:47,190
You can apply to go to the Sales Department tomorrow. I will train you personally.

401
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:50,560
Let me think about it.

402
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:54,020
You can't figure out why she thinks this way.

403
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:57,900
It's very simple. I can just explain it clearly to her.

404
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:00,800
I'm get exhausted at work every day.

405
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:05,190
After I get home, she troubles me with everything.

406
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:08,890
If she isn't arguing with my mom, then she is giving me the silent treatment.

407
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:12,950
I'd prefer working overtime rather than going back home now.

408
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:20,130
I read a book recently. The core thinking is

409
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:23,480
never try to reason with your wife. You have to influence her with emotion.

410
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,460
How?

411
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:29,990
For example, be more considerate. Think of her.

412
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:32,670
Whatever she needs, do it for her.

413
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:40,120
- Gu Xiaoling needs money. Can I afford it? 
 - That's why

414
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,850
you and Gu Xiaoling are not well suited.

415
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:44,370
Liu Yang,

416
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:48,830
don't listen to him. It's very crucial for you now. You are about to get promoted.

417
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:54,280
Your backyard can't have a fire. There can't be any problems, or else everything will be a mess.

418
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:02,440
Yiming and Siyu are so nice. You have similar goals and work hard together.

419
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,360
You guys also have a lot of topics to talk about together.

420
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:12,460
Actually Siyu and I also have many problems.

421
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,560
What problems?

422
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:20,060
We think differently about many things.

423
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:28,160
Can't we rest for a moment?

424
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:35,070
It seems that I was right to not get married in a rush.

425
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:39,400
You are not the same. Yiming is so in love with you.

426
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:45,150
Let's talk about you and Liu Yang. Let's talk about my parents.

427
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:48,400
They also got married because of love.

428
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:53,820
But my mom only passed away for a few months and my dad got remarried.

429
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:58,370
Weren't your dad and my mom happy together?

430
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:03,620
Yes. I'm happy for him.

431
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:09,460
But because he is very happy now,

432
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:13,290
I feel sad for my mom.

433
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:17,170
You are hurting me a lot saying those words.

434
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:18,570
Sensitive.

435
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:21,440
It's you who is obviously sensitive.

436
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:28,720
If Aunt were alive, Aunt and Uncle would be living together very well.

437
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:35,610
But she is not here anymore. You can't stop Uncle from starting a new life forever.

438
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:38,560
But it's just too quick!

439
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,870
It was so fast that it makes me suspect

440
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:44,970
that everything between him and my mom was fake.

441
00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:48,120
So, you think Chen Yiming's love for you is also fake?

442
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:51,870
No, Yiming's love for me is definitely real.

443
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:55,810
- But that doesn't eliminate that in the future— 
 - You...

444
00:34:55,810 --> 00:35:00,300
are just dramatic. Who can be certain about the future?

445
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:04,430
Chen Yiming becoming a playboy and Liu Yang cheating are all possible.

446
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:11,620
You can't deny the current relationship because of an uncertain future.

447
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:16,600
You have finally said something useful.

448
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,090
I have more.

449
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:20,970
You say Liu Yang is not easy.

450
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:25,770
In order to marry you, Chen Yiming went through great pains. Was it easy for him?

451
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:28,360
I didn't say I wouldn't get married.

452
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:31,000
- You don't fear marriage anymore? 
 - I do!

453
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:35,010
But...

454
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:41,420
as long as I get married, I can defeat the fear of marriage.

455
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:13,000
- Hello? 
 - Yiming.

456
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,030
Tomorrow, let's go to the realtor's and

457
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:17,730
sign the contract for the house.

458
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:21,850
Didn't you want to look at more?

459
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:24,500
- I changed my mind. I want this one. 
 - Good.

460
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:35,330
Come on.

461
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:43,730
- Nice! 
 - Thermos thermal mug. Keep your stomach and your heart warm.

462
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:46,470
Thermos thermal mug! Warm your stomach and your heart!

463
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:49,620
Bro, buy one for someone you want to give warmth to.

464
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:51,910
Thermos thermal mug! Warm your stomach and your heart!

465
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:53,780
Bro, the days are about to get cold. Consider buying one.

466
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:56,680
It's very cost-effective to use as a gift or to have for personal use.

467
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:59,870
Thermos thermal mug! Warm your stomach and your heart!

468
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:03,720
Thermos thermal mug! Warm your stomach and your heart! Brother.

469
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:07,860
- How much is it? 
 - This is a German brand.

470
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:11,810
They're usually ¥300 to ¥400, but there's a promotion today, so they are only ¥268.

471
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,080
Yes, that's how you write it.

472
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:18,270
- Write it ten times, okay? 
 - Okay.

473
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:42,630
Mom, didn't I throw this in the trash can?

474
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:44,840
I fished it back out.

475
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,990
It's expired. We can't eat it anymore.

476
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:55,630
It's fine. It's only been expired for a few days. It not a big deal.

477
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:57,810
We still can't eat it.

478
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:05,510
If you guys don't eat it, then I will.

479
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:09,770
It's not like you're rich, throwing everything away.

480
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:17,120
Let me see what you wrote.

481
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,670
- Yang, you're back? 
 - Yes.

482
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:28,100
You came back quite early today. Give it to me.

483
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,950
Come eat.

484
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:32,760
The food we saved for you is still warm.

485
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:37,140
Sit, sit.

486
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:41,760
Dad, my pen isn't working!

487
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,460
If it's not working, you can get a pen from my bag!

488
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:59,720
Mom! Look what this is!

489
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,930
It's a thermal mug.

490
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:15,090
Such a pretty thermal mug, who... who did you buy it for?

491
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,610
It's for Zhizhi.

492
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:27,150
There's not much food left. Let me make you some sweet and sour pork.

493
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:28,890
Okay.

494
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:29,470
Vegetables went up in price again. Yesterday, potatoes were just ¥2.99,

495
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:32,770
and today they've raised it to ¥3.59.

496
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:37,660
Didn't Mom say her leg is hurting? I want to buy her a therapy knee pad.

497
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:39,500
I inquired about the brands.

498
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,810
There's a promotion going on in the next two days.

499
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:44,590
How come you're not using the new thermal mug to drink?

500
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:46,610
I can't bear to.

501
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:49,850
It was more than  ¥200. What do you mean you can't bear to?

502
00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:52,930
¥200 is too expensive. Where did you buy it?

503
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:56,860
- A store next to the subway station. 
 - Where's the invoice?

504
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:59,420
- I threw it out. 
 - That store

505
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:02,140
sells things at much higher prices than online.

506
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:05,730
Since I bought it for you, just use it.

507
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:10,900
Oh, right. Today,

508
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:13,510
I did the paperwork to transfer schools for Yuwei.

509
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:22,600
This time, it was my fault for losing us so much money.

510
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:27,080
I'm glad I corrected myself, so we wouldn't lose even more

511
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:31,990
and I know I was wrong. This kind of thing won't happen again.

512
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:38,060
You were right. We are not in the same social circle as those other people.

513
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:41,300
Yet, I forcefully joined them resulting in me

514
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,620
being upset.

515
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:53,630
Everything else is unimportant.

516
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:56,060
As long as you've thought it through, then it's fine.

517
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:08,650
There's something else.

518
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:13,340
Sister Siyu wants me to go to the Sales Department.

519
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:18,700
Forget about it.

520
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,400
Why?

521
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:25,330
Think about it. After a while, I will be the deputy director.

522
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:27,240
I'll be busier than I am now.

523
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,920
If you really transfer to the Sales Department, you'll be leaving early and coming back late.

524
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,570
What would happen to Yuwei? Who would take care of her?

525
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:35,440
If we gave her to Mom, would you feel at ease?

526
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:42,530
Besides, I know about Siyu's situation.

527
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:45,580
Even Chen Yiming often says that he can't tolerate it.

528
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:47,780
We probably couldn't either.

529
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:49,660
That's true.

530
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:54,330
I think that the Administration Department suits you well. Even though the salary is not very high,

531
00:42:54,330 --> 00:42:58,370
it is an easy job and there are regular hours.

532
00:42:58,370 --> 00:43:01,740
You don't have to worry about earning money. I'm here.

533
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:10,820
But women need to have their own careers as well.

534
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:18,340
I'm your career.

535
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:20,660
Yuwei is your career.

536
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,730
Don't think about too much.

537
00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:29,170
Let's just steadily live our days.

538
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:39,730
Mr. Wu! Mr. Wu.

539
00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:41,930
I checked all of the companies that were qualified,

540
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:44,540
- and guess what I found? 
 - Tell me.

541
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:48,420
My middle school classmate's husband works at the R&D Department at Lubao.

542
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:54,220
This is a picture that I found in his Wechat Moments.

543
00:43:58,030 --> 00:43:59,960
Is there something a problem?

544
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:07,470
 Timing & Subtitles by My Dear Myself Team @Viki.com 

545
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:10,140
Isn't this the same person?

546
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:12,120
- Isn't that Liu Yang's wife? 
 - That's right.

547
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,950
Her name is Zhang Zhizhi. She's in the Administration Department at Lubao.

548
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:18,520
I found out that she and the person who submitted the bid for Lubao, Director Li,

549
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:20,440
are cousins.

550
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,540
That's wonderful!

551
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:25,020
Mr. Wu, how about tomorrow morning,

552
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:27,010
we report this to the director?

553
00:44:27,010 --> 00:44:29,510
This time, Liu Yang is doomed.

554
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:33,100
Don't be anxious. Let me think about it.

555
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:39,050
What if Liu Yang already told the director about their relationship?

556
00:44:40,990 --> 00:44:42,970
Even if he didn't,

557
00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:45,930
Liu Yang was only responsible for the preliminary work.

558
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:49,610
The people who make the official decision are experts.

559
00:44:49,610 --> 00:44:52,380
Liu Yang can still get himself out of trouble.

560
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:56,020
Then we'll find a way to make him unable to do so!

561
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:59,590
Xiao Zhao, you have finally gotten smart.

562
00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:04,380
I was forced to after working in reception.

563
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:07,270
We must be smarter than the first two times.

564
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:10,210
We can choose not to, but if we do it,

565
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:12,610
we must make sure we don't fail again.

566
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:21,240
