00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,000
[Episode 30]

4
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,600
- What do you want to eat? 
 - This one?

5
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,700
Hello, what would you guys...?

6
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,000
Juice.

7
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,600
I'm sorry, you cannot bring children in here.

8
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,100
It's fine. Tell your boss that Haowen is here.

9
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,400
Does it taste good?

10
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,400
Yes.

11
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,800
Tell me what you've been up to lately.

12
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:00,700
Yiming, I'm very anxious right now. I hope I can get a job quickly.

13
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:04,300
I want to help Zhizhi carry the burden a little more.

14
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,000
You can't rush in this kind of situation.

15
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,400
Wasn't I just like you in the past?

16
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,700
Who is classmate Haohao?

17
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:19,800
He was a classmate in my old preschool.

18
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,600
Do you like him?

19
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,200
Don't tell anyone else!

20
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,600
Of course. Only we know about this.

21
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,100
Don't lie to me!

22
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,900
Let's make a pinky promise.

23
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,200
Don't tell anyone else about this matter.

24
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,600
This is a little secret between the two of us.

25
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,800
I won't. I definitely will not tell anyone else.

26
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,800
Don't lie to me.

27
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,200
I'm sorry. I just asked the boss, and you are still not allowed to bring children here.

28
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,200
Did you get it wrong?

29
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,600
Did you tell him, Huangpu District, Lei Haowen?

30
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,200
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I already asked.

31
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,000
Go back and tell him.

32
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,600
No, no. It's fine.

33
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,000
- I'm sorry. 
 - This place wasn't suited for children to begin with. Let's change places.

34
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,400
You guys can wait for me at the doorway. I'll pay.

35
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,800
- How could this have happened? 
 - I'm sorry, I'm sorry, really sorry.

36
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,300
- Come. It's this way, right? 
 - Yes, this way.

37
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,700
Okay.

38
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,400
- The food and drinks? 
 - All in place.

39
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,600
And the people who are welcoming the guests?

40
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,200
At the parking lot is Xiaoli, downstairs is Xiao Jiang,

41
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,800
At the elevator's front is Xiao Ming, Xiao Liang is here, and the general responsibility falls on me.

42
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,000
The speech presentation?

43
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,200
I checked it three times. It's okay.

44
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,100
How's the server doing?

45
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,200
Perfect.

46
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,300
Our promotional materials?

47
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,400
They're all in place.

48
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,400
Then we can end here today.

49
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,800
Everyone, go home and rest.

50
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,400
Tomorrow let's bring our best selves to welcome Laidianle going live!

51
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,800
- Fighting! 
 - Fighting!

52
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,800
Tomorrow is your big celebration,

53
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,200
but I have to work overtime,

54
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,200
and Zhizhi needs to watch Yuwei, so neither of us can come.

55
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:38,100
We were thinking of sending you a flower basket.

56
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,300
Sister Siyu,

57
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:44,800
for the characters on the flower basket, do you like "profits pouring in from all sides" or "Customers coming like clouds"?

58
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:49,020
If you must write, then write

59
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,000
"Let's wish for Laidianle to become successful immediately after launch.

60
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,600
Li Siyu's wishes all come true.”

61
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,100
Can I really write it that way?

62
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,800
Why not?

63
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,800
Fine then.

64
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,800
Well, I'm going to hang up now.

65
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,300
Bye-bye.

66
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,600
Hello? Hi.

67
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,200
- Is this Laidiane company?  
 - Yes.

68
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,500
Your delivery has arrived. Please come downstairs to get it.

69
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,600
What is it?

70
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,500
I think it's your company's handbooks.

71
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,560
I'm going down right away.

72
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:23,000
Hey, Older Sister. Older Sister, what's wrong?

73
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,800
Guan Xiaotang!

74
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,400
Didn't you say all of the promotional materials were in place?

75
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,300
How come there is still a deliveryman bringing our handbooks?

76
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,200
I forgot about the handbooks!

77
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,200
Hello! Is this the delivery for Laidianle?

78
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,000
Yes.

79
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,400
Please let me borrow your pen.

80
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,200
Thank you.

81
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,200
- Thank you. 
 - No problem.

82
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,200
I-I-I-I was wrong.

83
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:26,560
Today, you can leave the company.

84
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,400
Y-You can't just kick me out like this!

85
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,200
I can.

86
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,200
Older Sister, you...

87
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,600
No, but this can't be completely my fault.

88
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,500
What are you doing?

89
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:47,400
B-But the delivery people should have brought them yesterday like they planned.

90
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,600
It was their problem.

91
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,800
Also, I wasn't the one in charge of this,

92
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,800
it was the publicity department's Xiao Sun's job, but you forced him to resign.

93
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,600
I was put on this job temporarily.

94
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,600
No, no! Even if it was my fault,

95
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,200
t-that doesn't mean I should get the death penalty.

96
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,800
I asked you three times and you said that there were no problems, but then such a big mess happened.

97
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,700
If you don't die, then who does?

98
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,400
Aren't they just missing handbooks?

99
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,600
For these handbooks, I worked hard for a whole month,

100
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,800
went to 13 businesse,s and drove four cameramen insane.

101
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,400
Do you believe that I can wreck you, you little brat?

102
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,600
I believe it, I believe it.

103
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,400
It... I-I-It seems like it's broken.

104
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,600
What's going on?

105
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,400
I... I-I-I'll ask.

106
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,700
It was working just fine when I came down.

107
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:06,560
How could this have happened? Are they purposefully not letting us work overtime?

108
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,200
Older Sister Director Li, Older Sister Director Li.

109
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,400
What's the situation?

110
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,200
There's good news and bad news. Which would you like first?

111
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,200
The bad news.

112
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,000
The bad news is that one of the elevators broke down,

113
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,800
and for safety reasons, they closed down all of them.

114
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,000
What?

115
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,800
The good news is that the elevator repairmen promised that tomorrow, at 10:00 a.m.,

116
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,800
all of the elevators will be finished getting fixed, and everything will work out.

117
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,400
Well, what about the delivery elevator?

118
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,400
It broke down multiple days ago.

119
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,000
You call this good news?

120
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,200
It's fine. Our launch ceremony starts at 10:00 a.m., this isn't going to cause us to fall behind at all.

121
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,500
What about these handbooks?

122
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,500
We can just leave them here. When the delivery elevator gets fixed tomorrow, we can just bring them up.

123
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,800
That can't work.

124
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,800
The guests are coming at 10:00 a.m., and we have to get the handbooks in the present boxes before they arrive.

125
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,400
That's 200 present boxes,

126
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,000
it would take at least two hours.

127
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,600
So we need to get the handbooks into all of the present boxes tonight.

128
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,000
B-But we don't even have... an elevator.

129
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,800
There are stairs.

130
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,600
Older Sister Director Li, our company is on the 12th floor!

131
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,400
Older Sister, how many times are we going have to move them up?

132
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,500
Older Sister Director Li, why is your temper so bad?

133
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,800
Because you worry too little.

134
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,400
Has your temper always been this bad,

135
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,400
or was it after your heartbreak that your personality became like this?

136
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,000
Guan Xiaotang, do you want to be scolded or beat up?

137
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,600
I... Don't want any of those.

138
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,600
I just wanted to get in on some juicy gossip to lighten things up!

139
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,600
There is no gossip.

140
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:55,000
Well... Well, tell me about your ex-boyfriend.

141
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,400
In the stories, he's the one you were going to marry but then kicked you out.

142
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,000
Guan Xiaotang,

143
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
do 95-liners not know that when talking to their bosses, they need to be proper?

144
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,800
Not all 95-liners are like this, it's just me. I have guts.

145
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,900
I have nothing I'm too afraid to say and nothing I'm too afraid to do.

146
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,000
Do you believe that I can beat you up right now?

147
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,600
I... R-R-Right, you should conserve your energy to climb the stairs, Older Sister.

148
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,400
However... However, Older Sister, I think you really can talk to me about it.

149
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:36,600
You can just pretend I'm a treehole. If you have anything you're unhappy about,

150
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,400
just say it. Don't leave them in your heart!  What if your heart grows tumors?

151
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,100
Get out.

152
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,400
Then... how did the two of you meet?

153
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,400
Just tell me.

154
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,300
Tell me, tell me, tell me.

155
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,500
It was a bit of an accident,

156
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,310
and felt a little bit like love at first sight.

157
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:38,200
Their company had planned an art exhibit.

158
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,300
I don't know what about me attracted him,

159
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,700
but he started to ask me out.

160
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,800
Of course, he was very handsome,

161
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,400
had creativity, and was handsome in the clean sort of way.

162
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:57,600
How handsome was he? As handsome as me?

163
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,800
If you keep spouting nonsense, I'm going to stop talking about this.

164
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,000
I... G-G-G-Go ahead. Go on.

165
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,400
All these years,

166
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,450
we created dreams together and worked hard together.

167
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,600
Not only were we lovers,

168
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,800
but we were also best friends.

169
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,500
His growth included me,

170
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,000
and mine him.

171
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,900
But we were two people, after all.

172
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,000
Just like two different branches on one tree,

173
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,800
even though we grew up together,

174
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,200
at some point in our growth,

175
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:18,100
we suddenly realized that we were getting farther and farther from each other.

176
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:22,200
Our futures pointed in different directions,

177
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,100
but he wasn't willing to give in,

178
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,300
and I wasn't willing to give up.

179
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:33,960
Breaking up was our only option.

180
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,400
When we were together, we both thought the other person was unnecessary,

181
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,800
in the way, cold-blooded.

182
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,300
But after breaking up, I realized

183
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,000
that half of myself was already gone.

184
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,600
You... explain it in a way that makes me feel pity.

185
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:25,070
Really.

186
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,900
I know about the things you say about me behind my back.

187
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,000
We were just messing around.

188
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,200
Everything you said was correct.

189
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,800
The only way I can forget the pain a little bit

190
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,800
is to make myself

191
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,700
suffer, fill myself with work, and become tired.

192
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,600
We're the ones who you are making suffer, too busy, and tired, okay?

193
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,000
Li Siyu,

194
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,200
what kind of boss are you? Exploiting your workers to give yourself peace of mind.

195
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,200
Thank you guys for being by my side during this time.

196
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,800
You also have to endure

197
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,100
my extremeness, my insanity, and my cold-bloodedness.

198
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,200
It's fine.

199
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,400
A good older sister admits her mistakes and changes herself to fix them.

200
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,370
I fear that I will be unable to change.

201
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,600
I-I-I'll do it.

202
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,400
Fine, go ahead.

203
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,200
Can you do this?

204
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,400
I... can, yes.

205
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,200
Move.

206
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,800
No, I... You take one, and I'll take three.

207
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,600
I am a mature, able-bodied man.

208
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,400
Am I mature?

209
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,700
I am mature.

210
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,400
We're still not there.

211
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,000
There are still five floors.

212
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,200
I talked so much about myself,

213
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:11,250
now it's your turn.

214
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:15,010
What's there to say about me?

215
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:21,800
Let me ask you. Why do you always act

216
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:25,400
like you're heartless and foolish?

217
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:32,200
It could be because my life experience was too torturous.

218
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,600
And if I had a heart, I would have died long ago.

219
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:40,000
Stupid brat. How could you possibly have life experience?

220
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,800
Really.

221
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:47,000
When I was two years old, my dad got into a car accident and died.

222
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,400
My mom remarried...

223
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:53,200
and I grew up with my grandfather.

224
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,700
But my grandfather didn't get much of a salary,

225
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,000
so he had to live by picking up trash.

226
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,800
You're making this up.

227
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,700
I'm not making anything up.

228
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,470
I think there's nothing wrong with picking up trash.

229
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,400
At least that way, I can look at all sorts of gaming devices.

230
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,800
So, that's why I'm so good at video games.

231
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,400
Older Sister,

232
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:19,100
I also really like Transformers.

233
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
When I was little, I took all sorts of Transformers that my grandpa picked up

234
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,800
and put them together, making them one-of-a-kind Transformers.

235
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:34,000
Then, on birthdays, I would gift them to myself.

236
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,800
When is your birthday? I'll gift you a Transformer.

237
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:49,960
You lied to me?

238
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,400
Guess.

239
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,600
Guan Xiaotang! Don't move!

240
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,000
You can't kick me!

241
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,800
- Stop right there! 
 - Catch me if you can.

242
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,600
Older Sister,

243
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:19,600
Do you think our company, Laidianle, will be successful?

244
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,000
It must be successful.

245
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,400
Otherwise, it makes everything I gave up not worth it.

246
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,600
I climbed 60 flights of stairs with you.

247
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,600
I worked hard and got no credit.

248
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,400
Do I still need to leave the company?

249
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,100
No.

250
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,700
Older Sister,

251
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:52,200
I think you don't have to be so fierce in the future.

252
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,400
First of all,

253
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,500
being fierce is useless. This is just my personality.

254
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,200
Secondly,

255
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:04,200
honestly, I've already seen right through you.

256
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,000
You are a person

257
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
who is tough on the outside, but in your heart, you are quite gentle.

258
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:22,460
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five,

259
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:26,720
four, three, two, one.

260
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:33,850
I declare Laidianle to be officially online.

261
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:06,650
Some people said that I couldn't succeed in making this website.

262
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:10,560
Other people said that I couldn't, in such a small amount of time,

263
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,020
launch this website.

264
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:15,460
But right now, in this moment,

265
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:18,820
all of the doubt has been transformed into miracles,

266
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:23,930
and the creator of these miracles is me, Li Siyu.

267
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:27,250
I toast this first glass of wine to myself.

268
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:46,310
This miracle does not only belong to me, but it belongs to all of you as well.

269
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:50,270
My employees, my franchisees.

270
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:54,620
You are my allies, as well as my partners in battle.

271
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:58,540
Without all of you, it would have been impossible to do it alone.

272
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:03,210
Today, we are all miracle makers.

273
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:06,660
This second glass of wine is a toast to all of you.

274
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:08,870
- Great! 
 - Drain it!

275
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:24,160
This journey was hard to walk.

276
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:31,130
But after working together and doing our best,

277
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:35,700
our spirit of win-win cooperation, we made it finally.

278
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:39,890
And I believe that if we continue to cooperate well together,

279
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:44,210
fight and win together, we can not only create a beginning of miracle,

280
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:48,840
we can also build a splendid future!

281
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,920
With this third glass of wine, let's toast to the future!

282
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,400
Toast to the future!

283
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:08,100
Don't drink too much, just a little is fine.

284
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,320
- Director Li, congratulations. 
 - Hey, Lao Bai. 
 - Thank you.

285
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,890
Today's a day for celebration, let's drink to that!

286
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:16,620
- Director Li, let us toast to you. 
 - I'll drink in her stead.

287
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,120
- We're toasting to Director Li. Why would you drink? 
 - Exactly.

288
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:22,620
I'm always making older sister angry. Of course I have to drink for her.

289
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:25,260
Siyu, congratulations!

290
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:29,540
GM Pan, GM Pan! I know that you've always been taking care of Director Li. I'll drink in her stead.

291
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:33,770
Go somewhere else. This is the home court of me and GM Pan.

292
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:38,070
The opening was quite good.

293
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:41,620
Next step is launching the offline market. It's a tough job.

294
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,990
Right now, how many branches do you have?

295
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:46,220
Right now we've built 15.

296
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:49,680
The plan is to build an additional 50 within the next three months.

297
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,280
- Are they all franchisees? 
 - Yes.

298
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,670
How many cities are you planning on expanding to this year? How many spots?

299
00:25:56,670 --> 00:26:00,430
- The plan is 3 cities, 100 spots. 
 - Not enough.

300
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:04,050
We need a minimum of 20 cities, 800 spots.

301
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:07,580
I fear that if we go too fast, problems will occur.

302
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:09,860
Okay, Siyu,

303
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:15,210
even though Laidianle has special qualities, it's still different from Lubao Batteries.

304
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:18,980
It doesn't have core technology. It's very easy for people to copy it.

305
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:23,440
If you don't work fast enough, other people will pass you, and then the market will no longer be yours.

306
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,920
But right now we don't have enough funds.

307
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,470
Lubao Batteries will add to it!

308
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:29,170
Perfect, I've been waiting for these words!

309
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:34,670
Li Siyu, as your investor, Lubao needs your performance.

310
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:38,230
GM Pan, don't worry, Laidianle will not let you down.

311
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,890
Okay, I believe in you.

312
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,440
- Wine, please. 
 - Coming!

313
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:57,990
Guan Xiangtang, who told you to change this to grape juice?

314
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:59,640
Give me the real thing!

315
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:06,490
That kid doesn't understand things.

316
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:43,270
Then in the future, every time a dream comes true,

317
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:48,790
- we will light up a firework to celebrate. 
 - Okay.

318
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,970
GM Pan, look.

319
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:58,570
Within the next three years, Laidianle will IPO!

320
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:00,190
Okay, I believe in you.

321
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:02,180
She really has this potential.

322
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:05,030
Director Li, we are all hoping that day comes quickly!

323
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:09,560
Until that day, I will definitely share the internet benefit with everyone!

324
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,360
I promise!

325
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,910
Deal!

326
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:16,380
- Goodbye! 
 - Goodbye! 
 - Drink less.

327
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,300
- Goodbye! 
 - Goodbye!

328
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,520
Go back!

329
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,470
Go back home and rest, come back tomorrow to clean up.

330
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:51,520
It was a nicely fought battle.

331
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:54,560
Why haven't you left yet?

332
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,620
You've worked hard today.

333
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:08,710
What's up with you?

334
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:15,960
I poured some grape juice to make you drink less out of kindness. Why did you scold me?

335
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,480
I was happy today!

336
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,600
Just because you were happy doesn't mean you shouldn't care about your stomach.

337
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,970
Take this medicine.

338
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:30,460
Why are you suddenly thoughtful today?

339
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:33,240
Oh, learned it from you.

340
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,300
You also have a bad temper now?

341
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,320
Also, learned it from you!

342
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:44,660
Director Older Sister Li, you really can't drink like that.

343
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:56,750
Student Guan Xiaotang, thank you.

344
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:58,990
Don't just thank me with words.

345
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:01,670
If you wanted to actually thank me, increase my salary.

346
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:04,250
How come you're always talking about money, money, money?

347
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:06,240
Because I'm poor.

348
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:11,730
Xiaotang, trust me.

349
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:14,450
I will take all of you to achieve our dreams.

350
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:16,880
I don't really care about dreams,

351
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,550
just don't make me work overtime too much.

352
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:23,130
Don't worry. From now on, we'll be 007 (bond).

353
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:26,220
Li Siyu, I want to resign!

354
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,750
You are only allowed to resign your job after our product launches in the market.

355
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:33,560
No way.

356
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:37,370
When you finish cleaning up your things, go home to sleep. We need to keep fighting tomorrow.

357
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:43,470
Oh my goodness, no way.

Accept it.

374
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,580
Did you buy this on Taobao? 
 (T/N: A cheap online market)

375
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:26,570
How much did you spend?

376
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:27,720
¥200.

377
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:30,140
- Free shipping? 
 - Yes.

378
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:35,330
- Seven day return guarantee, no questions asked? 
 - Yes.

379
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:39,630
Send me the link. Our museum could use that for our next cocktail party.

380
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:43,920
You're not even the slightest bit moved by my gesture?

381
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:48,550
If you turned all of these into gems, then I would be moved.

382
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:52,270
You're still crazy truthful.

383
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:56,590
And you're still as vulgar as always.

384
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:59,270
Let's go. I'll treat you to a midnight snack.

385
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:00,600
I want to break things off with you.

386
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,670
Break things off after you eat.

387
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:17,430
[This is the man God gave you]

388
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:23,780
The preliminary layout is pretty much complete, and the next step is to carry it out.

389
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,910
- No problem. Go ahead and do it. 
 - Okay.

390
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:29,080
- President Wang. 
 - Yes?

391
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,830
The aquarium store's workers have arrived.

392
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:35,480
You've worked hard. Put it in the old place, okay?

393
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:38,170
Be careful. Be careful of the door.

394
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:57,590
That fish tank is a little bit big.

395
00:35:57,590 --> 00:36:01,410
When we bought the fish they were only 20-30 cm long.

396
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:06,240
Now, they're so much bigger. We have to give them a bigger fish tank.

397
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,820
Then the old fish tank is unusable now?

398
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,040
No.

399
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:18,860
Big fish tanks are where we put big fish, and little fish tanks are for smaller fish. It has to be suitable.

400
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:25,870
The big fish also need more room to swim.

401
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:30,290
The small tank will have new small fish to inhabit it.

402
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:33,280
Right?

403
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:44,810
Yiming, I wanted to buy something recently, will you accompany me?

404
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:51,310
I just think that your style and fashion sense are quite good.

405
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:53,470
Can you give me some suggestions?

406
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:56,180
I... I'm just normal.

407
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:58,010
You're not willing?

408
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,480
Of course, I'm willing.

409
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,710
- Then it's settled. 
 - Yes.

410
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:08,980
Go ahead and work.

411
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:14,820
Okay. Then I'll leave.

412
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:20,710
Mister, please fill in the customer information.

413
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:10,200
Mister, is there anything else I can help you with?

414
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:36,370
This is what matches the Munsell color pattern. Thank you.

415
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:52,910
Does he have a problem?

416
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:55,490
I think he is interested in you.

417
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:56,870
Why would you think so?

418
00:39:56,870 --> 00:39:59,460
Earlier, he asked what your name was.

419
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:02,210
Hello, can I please ask what your colleague's name is?

420
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:04,470
Her name is Gu Xiaoling.

421
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:05,550
Is she married?

422
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:07,440
Not yet.

423
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:13,890
What's wrong with her foot?

424
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:15,740
She sprained it.

425
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:17,900
What did he buy?

426
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,600
"Untitled."

427
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:24,770
The one that costs ¥40,800 by Agnes Martin?

428
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:25,830
Is he a member here?

429
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:27,530
Yes.

430
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:37,040
I asked again,

431
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:41,190
but your resume really is not good enough.

432
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:43,900
They all felt bad.

433
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:48,200
In the end, one department was willing to take you,

434
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:52,380
and if you work hard enough, you can have a high salary.

435
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,720
I'll go.

436
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:56,650
Sales Department.

437
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:02,230
I know that you and Director Yuan have had problems in the past.

438
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:05,880
More than just problems.

439
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:11,410
Director Yuan already clearly stated that she is willing to take you.

440
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:15,810
But whether it's for work or personal reasons, I still want to remind you

441
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:19,910
that if you choose to go, you must prepare to be tortured.

442
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,800
Are you going or not?

443
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:31,740
I will think on it. Thank you, Director Hu.

444
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:33,830
Zhang Zhizhi.

445
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:47,190
Lately have you been meeting up with Li Siyu often?

446
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:48,540
No.

447
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:52,390
I heard she started a company called Laidianle.

448
00:42:52,390 --> 00:42:55,670
Old Pan also gave her batteries at the lowest price.

449
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:57,950
I don't know about that.

450
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:04,590
If Li Siyu didn't have Old Pan to back her up, what could she possibly do with her life?

451
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:07,430
Director Yuan, I still have business to attend to. I'll be leaving now.

452
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:11,610
Wait. I heard that you wanted to switch departments.

453
00:43:14,070 --> 00:43:18,100
My Sales Department welcomes you.

454
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:20,390
I fear that I don't have the skill.

455
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:21,790
Suit yourself.
