[Episode 25]

4
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,860
The information that I got was that GM Pan rejected the idea

5
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:40,550
and insisted on waiting until you came back. Director Fang didn't really say anything,

6
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:44,350
but a lot of mid-tier employees want to sign a letter

7
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:46,410
to invite Yuan Huizhong back.

8
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:48,880
Then, what did they decide in the end?

9
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,980
The Board of Directors plans to decide via voting.

10
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:54,400
Right, the Board of Directors now has a new member.

11
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,820
She is also a new shareholder of the company.

12
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:00,780
Sister Ziru?

13
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:08,470
How about you go talk to GM Pan?

14
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,880
Go talk to him and have him reinstate you early.

15
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,780
This way, Director Fang and Yuan Huizhong will give up.

16
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,580
We'll be voting next week.

17
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,390
Do we have a chance?

18
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:28,570
There are nine people on the Board of Directors.

19
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:31,670
Old Feng, Old Qin, and I will vote you for sure.

20
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,660
Pan Zhiyong,

21
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,630
the Finance Department, and the R&D Department will definitely vote for Li Siyu.

22
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,920
What about the other three votes?

23
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:46,660
Ma Chao, Shi Xin, and the new shareholder.

24
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:50,120
Who's the n-new shareholder?

25
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,830
She does financing. We met once, during the signing of the contract.

26
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:56,120
but we've never had a real interaction before.

27
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,690
If she doesn't understand the situation,

28
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:07,900
then she'll definitely listen to Pan Zhiyong and vote Li Siyu.

29
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:14,040
I talked to Ma Chao and Shi Xin privately,

30
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,070
but their attitude towards this

31
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,720
is not obvious.

32
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:27,670
Since Pan Zhiyong was the one who suggested to make the decision through voting,

33
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,540
he must be quite certain about the outcome.

34
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:37,460
Sister Ziru, Yiming won't let me drink wine,

35
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:40,730
so I'll use tea in place of it. Congratulations!

36
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:47,780
Speaking of it, I must thank you for all this.

37
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:52,920
If you didn't connect us all together, this never would have happened.

38
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:57,890
You've heard of my situation already, haven't you?

39
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:59,380
I've heard.

40
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:03,680
After we signed the contract, GM Pan explained the whole situation to me.

41
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,140
Siyu, you had to take the blame for the company.

42
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:10,670
I have to do what's best for the company. GM Pan also treats me well.

43
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:13,070
Taking the blame for the company is my duty.

44
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:17,110
As Lubao's shareholder, I thank you.

45
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,940
Thank you for being understanding, Sister Ziru.

46
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:28,600
Sister Ziru, I heard some news

47
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,240
about how the company's Board of Directors

48
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,130
is preparing to discuss who the new sales director should be.

49
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:37,290
Yes. The meeting is next week.

50
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:41,360
What do you think about this?

51
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,330
Right now, I'm Lubao's shareholder. Of course,

52
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:47,470
I will do whatever is most beneficial for Lubao.

53
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,800
I'm the most suitable for the position then.

54
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,250
Whether it's personal performance, team performance,

55
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,230
or the new records we made when I was the Sales Director,

56
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:57,960
all of these things can prove my capability.

57
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,910
But Director Fang recommended Yuan Huizhong,

58
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:03,240
and many of the executives support that.

59
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,180
Half a year ago, Sister Yuan and I

60
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,160
already had a competition to show who is better.

61
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,130
I've heard you talk about it before.

62
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,970
There's something else that I'm not sure whether GM Pan has told you or not.

63
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:19,640
At the time, when he suspended me, it was only temporary.

64
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,940
His plan was that when the situation had calmed down,

65
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:25,550
he would reinstate me.

66
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:28,050
He did tell me that.

67
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:31,700
From the start of my suspension till now,

68
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,060
it's been a long time.

69
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:39,300
People have also stopped bringing it up online.

70
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,150
Also, Lubao's sales

71
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:44,620
can't be left unattended,

72
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:49,900
so I think this is the best time for me to be reinstated.

73
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:54,260
Sister Ziru, if the Board of Directors talks about it,

74
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:57,340
whether it's in regards to work or personal relations, whether it is for sentiments or logical reasons,

75
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,840
I hope you will support me.

76
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,440
Siyu, the Lubao worker

77
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,130
I've known longest and talked to most is you.

78
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:10,540
From you, I saw Lubao's qualities.

79
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,770
I also saw Lubao's future.

80
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:15,700
That's why I made the decision to invest in it.

81
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,710
Do you understand what I mean?

82
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:24,580
Sister Ziru, thank you.

83
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,610
Dad.

84
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,600
What happened to me?

85
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,390
You fainted on the street.

86
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:15,830
Some kind people brought you to the hospital.

87
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:18,310
The doctors have diagnosed it

88
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,800
as Diabetic Nephropathy Stage Three.

89
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,870
What kind of illness is that?

90
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:28,040
Can it be cured?

91
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,880
The doctors say that it's in the early stages right now.

92
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:37,910
Your kidney damage is still reversible.

93
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:42,350
However, the treatment period may be long.

94
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:46,780
If you recover well, you will be able to live and work normally.

95
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,800
Recover...

96
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:55,550
Don't think about anything, just treat your illness first.

97
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:07,860
Zhizhi, I didn't think

98
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:11,250
that you would come and visit me.

99
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,600
After all,

100
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,700
you are Yuwei's father.

101
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:27,970
How has the Sales Department been doing lately?

102
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:31,910
Not great. There are so many rumors, and everyone feels disheartened.

103
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:36,200
However, the three of us have been the same as always.

104
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,730
Sis, we know that you will return sooner or later,

105
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:41,520
so the few of us have not slacked off.

106
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,040
I guess you are all smart.

107
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,490
Sister Siyu, when are you coming back?

108
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:50,820
After the Board of Directors has their meeting, we'll know.

109
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:54,340
- When the Board of Directors meeting? 
 - In the next few days.

110
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:58,120
Sister Siyu, we'll only feel at ease after you return.

111
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,670
We can't wait.

112
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:03,500
When I come back, I plan to rearrange the Sales Department.

113
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,310
You guys should be prepared.

114
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:07,130
- Got it! 
 - Got it!

115
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,040
Here, take a look.

116
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:13,730
If you have any concerns or suggestions, reach out to me at any time.

117
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:18,770
GM Wang, you wanted to see me?

118
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:21,540
- Yiming, come sit. 
 - Okay.

119
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:24,780
There's something I wanted your opinion on.

120
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,490
Tell me.

121
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:31,170
Siyu came looking for me a few days ago.

122
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,580
She hopes that at Lubao's Board of Directors meeting,

123
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,950
I will support her reinstatement.

124
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,100
She still hasn't given up on that thought?

125
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,610
I understand it.

126
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:48,010
In order to become the sales director, she worked very hard.

127
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:50,650
Of course, she doesn't want to give up so easily.

128
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,710
But she...

129
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,900
she's a little obsessed with it right now.

130
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:01,320
Yiming, from a business perspective,

131
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,890
Siyu's contributions to Lubao can be clearly seen by anyone.

132
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:08,520
She is also very qualified to be the sales director.

133
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:12,210
From a personal perspective, she and I have a friendship.

134
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:15,520
I am obligated to support her.

135
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:21,680
I wanted to hear your opinion about this.

136
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,670
I heard GM Pan say that after Lubao's incident,

137
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:28,780
you were the one who wrote all of the public relations responses.

138
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,650
Yes.

139
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:37,550
At the time, I advised Siyu to take the blame and resign,

140
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:40,960
but because GM Pan

141
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,680
values Siyu so much

142
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:45,720
he changed the resignation into a suspension.

143
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,640
Then from a crisis public relations perspective,

144
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,640
do you think Siyu is suitable to be reinstated?

145
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,730
She is very unsuitable.

146
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,990
I remember you'd said that Siyu's health wasn't very good either.

147
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:07,470
You also wish that she will resign or choose a less stressful job.

148
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:11,450
Yes, that's what I care about more.

149
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:16,540
Last week, I also tried to persuade her into doing that.

150
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:22,260
Then Yiming, should I vote against her?

151
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:28,660
GM Wang, as your subordinate,

152
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:33,630
and as Tianye Group's employee, I will definitely advise you to vote against her,

153
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:38,310
but as Siyu's f-fiancé,

154
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:40,650
I feel quite conflicted.

155
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:42,870
On the one hand, I want her to be happy,

156
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:46,430
to do what she wants, and to make her dreams come true;

157
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:50,220
but on the other hand, if she continues to be the sales director,

158
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:53,480
then her health, our relationship,

159
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,990
or even our future family might be affected negatively.

160
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,540
You have made this a hard decision for me.

161
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:13,700
GM Wang, don't you often talk about roles?

162
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:17,570
I think you should go back to playing your role

163
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,160
and not care too much about what I just said.

164
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,400
Decide how you think you should decide.

165
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,960
I don't have any prejudice against Li Siyu.

166
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:33,040
When it comes to capabilities, she is impeccable

167
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:36,070
but she just created a huge problem.

168
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:38,850
If we let her be reinstated,

169
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:41,240
what will the other employees think?

170
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,330
What will the clients think?

171
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,780
How would the public evaluate it?

172
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,450
But don't forget

173
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:50,360
Yuan Huizhong did something even worse before.

174
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,520
The truth about that has already come out.

175
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,740
The police just recently solved the case.

176
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:00,690
The con artists actually had no relations to Yuan Huizhong.

177
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:05,010
Still, the economic losses that she caused us cannot be fixed.

178
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:08,780
Yuan Huizhong did not ruin the company's reputation though.

179
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:13,730
I also think Yuan Huizhong's capability, compared to Li Siyu's,

180
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:15,420
is almost exactly the same.

181
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,970
Also, we wouldn't risk ruining public relations with her.

182
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:23,420
She is more suitable to be the sales director.

183
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:27,050
Li Siyu's capability is still better than Yuan Huizhong's.

184
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,850
These two candidates are very outstanding.

185
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:34,920
Honestly, I don't even know who I'm supposed to vote for.

186
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:39,340
However, as the Board of Directors, we do not only represent ourselves,

187
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:43,090
but we also represent all of Lubao's shareholders and employees.

188
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:46,520
So, please do not think from your own perspective when trying to solve this problem.

189
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,170
Do your best to stand a little taller and consider things from a broader perspective.

190
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:53,860
Since Director Fang mentioned all of the shareholders

191
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:58,830
and all of the employees, I need to remind everyone

192
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:02,610
that a few days ago, the office

193
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,650
received a letter from company executives a few days ago.

194
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:09,310
They all agree

195
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:13,460
to ask Yuan Huizhong to return to the company.

196
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:16,400
- How many people signed it? 
 - Eighteen people.

197
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,880
However, they are the backbones of this company.

198
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:25,550
GM Wang, in total, Lubao has 652 employees.

199
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:30,470
The letter is here. Everyone can take a look.

200
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,370
There's no need to look.

201
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:36,120
I still have a meeting after this, and GM Wang is also busy.

202
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,440
How about we follow the old rules

203
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,330
and vote on the decision?

204
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:44,910
All right. There are two boxes in front of everyone.

205
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:49,510
The red one represents Li Siyu, and the green one represents Yuan Huizhong.

206
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:51,990
Put your pencil into the box of the person

207
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:55,940
who you think would be more suitable for sales director.

208
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:05,170
[Yuan - Li ]

209
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:09,690
[Yuan 0 : Li 1]

210
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:11,170
[Yuan 0 : Li 2]

211
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:14,390
[Yuan 0 : Li 3]

212
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:16,070
[Yuan 1 : Li 3]

213
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:19,200
[Yuan 2 : Li 3]

214
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,850
[Yuan 3 : Li 3]

215
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:27,150
[Yuan 3 : Li 4]

216
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:29,730
[Yuan 4 : Li 4]

217
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:32,280
GM Wang still hasn't voted.

218
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,750
GM Wang, please cast your vote quickly.

219
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:51,330
[Yuan 5 : Li 4]

220
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:04,460
Li Siyu, four votes.

221
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:12,230
Yuan Huizhong, five votes.

222
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,620
According to the voting results,

223
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:21,420
the sales director will be Yuan Huizhong.

224
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,390
I still have business to attend to.

225
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:41,700
GM Wang.

226
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:45,980
Director Fang, there has been no one to manage the sales department for a while now.

227
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:49,240
I think we should announce the decision quickly.

228
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,320
Okay.

229
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,300
Siyu,

230
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:22,520
the results of the Board of Directors voting has come out.

231
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,760
It is... Yuan Huizhong.

232
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:32,360
Siyu, this was the decision of the Board of Directors.

233
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:39,050
Hello? Hello? Siyu?

234
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,460
Siyu?

235
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:56,270
Is there a possibility that this result can change?

236
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:59,280
How did it come to this result?

237
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:02,720
It is will be like this for now.

238
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:08,310
Then I... can't go back to Lubao?

239
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:15,090
How could this have happened?

240
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:17,700
I did all of these things for Lubao!

241
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,220
GM Pan, you promised me!

242
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:22,750
I did promise you, but things changed.

243
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,700
Aren't you the person in charge at Lubao?

244
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,480
Li Siyu, please calm down. Okay?

245
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,250
The Board of Directors is not just me. There are nine of us.

246
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:33,950
- But— 
 - First calm down. Calm down.

247
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,520
There's something I must tell you.

248
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:44,020
Today, at the Board of Directors meeting,

249
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:46,380
between you and Yuan Huizhong,

250
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:50,010
Wang Ziru made the most important vote.

251
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:52,280
What do you mean?

252
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,080
She voted for Yuan Huizhong.

253
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,860
Impossible!

254
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:59,150
Before the meeting, I calculated it.

255
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:02,350
Even if Wang Ziru didn't help you, she would help me

256
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:05,250
because when we signed the contract, she promised me

257
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:09,160
that at the Board of Directors meeting, she would side with me unconditionally.

258
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:13,100
That was the reason why I decided that the decision should be made through voting.

259
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,740
I didn't think this would be the result.

260
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:19,160
Why would she do this?

261
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:24,160
That's right, why?

262
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,680
You should ask her personally.

263
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,040
Thanks, Senior Brother.

264
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,960
Don't need to thank me.

265
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,690
I did this for everyone and for Lubao.

266
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:45,390
Once I take care of things here, I will report to Lubao immediately.

267
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:52,420
After you get back to the company, when you meet the shareholder, Wang Ziru,

268
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,720
you need to be cautious.

269
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,730
The woman from Tianye Group?

270
00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:00,700
You were able to come back because she made the most important vote.

271
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,200
Didn't you say that she and Li Siyu had a good relationship,

272
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,910
and Li Siyu was the one who introduced her to Old Pan?

273
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:14,020
That's why I think she's very strange.

274
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:18,140
Could it be that she has some other motives?

275
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,250
I don't know.

276
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:38,290
GM Wang, Li Siyu is downstairs. She wants to see you.

277
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:43,830
Where is Chen Yiming right now?

278
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,350
Okay, okay.

279
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:01,290
Ms. Li, GM Wang will see you. This way, please.

280
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:08,020
Ms. Li is here? This way, please.

281
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:17,300
GM Wang, Ms. Li is here.

282
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,260
Siyu is here? Come.

283
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,460
Sit over here.

284
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,150
Come.

285
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,240
This is your first time coming to my office, right?

286
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:36,170
- I want to know why. 
 - What?

287
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,540
What are you referring to?

288
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:45,350
You promised that you would support me.

289
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,830
Why did you fail to keep your words?

290
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:53,160
Did I say that?

291
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:56,030
You won't even admit it?

292
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,810
Think about it.

293
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,430
What exactly did I say?

294
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:10,410
Siyu, the person I've known the longest

295
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:14,040
and the person I have interacted most with from Lubao, is you.

296
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:17,490
From you, I saw Lubao's qualities

297
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:19,700
and I also saw Lubao's future.

298
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:22,800
That's why I chose to invest in it.

299
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:30,650
I guess I misunderstood.

300
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:35,500
Siyu, I approve of you, but

301
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:39,800
this doesn't mean that you are the best for the sales director position.

302
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,100
In your eyes,

303
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:47,910
Yuan Huizhong is more suitable than I am?

304
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:51,530
The truth is, you are both suitable.

305
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:57,150
But after thinking about some other reasons,

306
00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:00,020
I decided to vote for her.

307
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:04,990
What reasons?

308
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:11,150
You really shouldn't ask me that.

309
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,880
Then who should I ask?

310
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:40,820
Our first installment is almost ¥4 million–

311
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:43,920
- Chen Yiming! Why did you do that? 
 - Director Chen, I couldn't stop her.

312
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,820
Don't worry. You can go back to work.

313
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:49,580
What gives you the right to take away my right to work?

314
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:52,050
Siyu, we are in the office, please calm down. Let's talk outside.

315
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:57,160
I originally had my own office. Because of you, I have nothing!

316
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:58,940
What are you saying?

317
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:04,000
Stop acting! You always do what you want to do and never care about my feelings!

318
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:08,020
I'm working right now. Let's talk when we get home.

319
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,950
Don't touch me!

320
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:12,570
You think that because you wrecked my chances at being the sales director

321
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:15,700
that I will obediently go home with you and get married to you,

322
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,920
to be your housewife.

323
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:21,800
Let me tell you. Impossible!

324
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,610
- Siyu. 
 - We're breaking up!

325
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:44,630
I apologize, some personal problems. It's nothing. Let's continue.

326
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:49,920
- Where did we get to? 
 - The first installment is ¥4 million. 
 - Yes, right. The first installment is ¥4 million.

327
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:36,350
Yiming.

328
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:41,290
GM Wang.

329
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:45,760
Earlier, Siyu came looking for me.

330
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,940
Right, she just left from here.

331
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:55,010
In the vote for Lubao's sales director... I gave it to Yuan Huizhong.

332
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:59,590
She came to question me just now and I accidentally mentioned you.

333
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,720
I figured.

334
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,690
- I'm really sorry. 
 - Don't. President Wang, you don't need to apologize to me.

335
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:11,460
It's not your problem, it's a problem between Siyu and I.

336
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:14,160
It didn't impact your relationship, right?

337
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,550
- She just told me she wanted to break up. 
 - What?

338
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,110
How about I go and talk to her?

339
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:24,930
No need.

340
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,320
You don't need to talk to her.

341
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,990
She should know that you're doing this for her own good.

342
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:32,480
She can't understand that right now.

343
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,680
How did this happen?

344
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:41,020
I was originally thinking that once her health was better

345
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:43,040
I could find her a less stressful job here at the company.

346
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:46,040
President Wang, please don't.

347
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:49,960
You've already done enough for us both. Really.

348
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:55,280
How about I give you a three-day break? Go keep her company and explain things to her.

349
00:26:56,530 --> 00:27:00,760
There's no need. I don't want to explain anymore.

350
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:07,170
You guys...

351
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:10,060
aren't really going to break up, right?

352
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,490
I don't know.

353
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:23,500
All right.

354
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,430
Yiming,

355
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:31,630
if you need any help or want to vent,

356
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:33,440
I am here.

357
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:38,260
Okay. Thank you, Sister Ziru.

358
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,530
Stop drinking!

359
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:32,890
Aren't you not allowed to drink? Give it to me.

360
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:36,730
I'm going through a heartbreak, can't I drink my sorrows away?

361
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:46,620
Yiming did this for your own good.

362
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:52,080
In this world, the most selfish words are

363
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,910
"I'm doing it for your own good."

364
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,830
What?

365
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,420
Do you know...

366
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:08,590
what words goes before that?

367
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:12,860
It is, "I am right

368
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:16,320
and you are wrong so you must listen to me.

369
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,900
You must follow my plans and be the type of girl I like."

370
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:24,170
Yiming isn't that bossy, right?

371
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:29,420
That's what he did.

372
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:33,210
No matter how much I liked this job,

373
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:38,290
but because he doesn't like it, he made them fire me.

374
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:58,130
He's not selfish. He really is doing it for your own good.

375
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,640
"For your own good."

376
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:05,510
Just because other people think it's good, it doesn't mean it's good.

377
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:09,470
It's only good if I think it is good.

378
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:13,590
You guys think that I should stay at home and be pretty.

379
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:17,530
No. I just want to go out there and fight for what I want.

380
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:21,640
You guys think I can't be the sales director,

381
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,930
yet that is exactly what I want to be.

382
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:28,900
Then, what do you want to do?

383
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:32,350
Not only will I become the sales director,

384
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:36,170
I will also be the general manager, the chairwoman.

385
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:40,210
I want them all to regret their decision today.

386
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:47,120
All right.

387
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,180
How are you?

388
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,590
I'm a lot better.

389
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:18,320
Zhizhi cooked these for you, right?

390
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,600
Yes.

391
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,950
Does she come to take care of you every day?

392
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:29,060
Oh, you. You used to blabber about how Zhizhi is like this or Zhizhi is like that ,

393
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:31,240
but look how good of a wife she is. Right?

394
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,530
Can we not talk about it?

395
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:37,660
All right, we won't talk about it.

396
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:41,570
Right now, take care of your health.

397
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:43,870
Once you get out of the hospital, find a job.

398
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:48,730
After that, you should commit yourself to a life with Zhizhi.

399
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:50,420
Eat it.

400
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:53,980
I also think the same way.

401
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:57,290
I just don't know what Zhizhi thinks.

402
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,950
She must think like this, too.

403
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:04,620
Would she be stupid? She makes food for you and take care of you every day.

404
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,090
Let's not talk about me.

405
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:14,360
What's wrong with Yiming? Why does he look so depressed?

406
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,060
Siyu wants to break up with him.

407
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:19,560
What? Want to break up?

408
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:22,450
Siyu and Yiming are talking about breaking up.

409
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,770
How is that possible?

410
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:30,880
Yiming, wake up! Wake up!

411
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,340
Tell me. What happened? Why did you break up?

412
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:42,660
Say something.

413
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,570
Perhaps we are not suitable to get married to each other.

414
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:49,710
You can't say those words so casually.

415
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:51,810
But is that the case?

416
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:56,580
Before, with just one glance, we understood each other.

417
00:32:57,430 --> 00:33:00,170
Now, I don't approve of what she wants

418
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:03,430
and she doesn't understand the things I do.

419
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:06,760
Then you should work hard to get back to what it was like before.

420
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:10,330
You make it sound easy. How have I not been working hard? Haven't I been working hard this whole time?

421
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:12,060
Right now, she—

422
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,600
- She said that she wants to break up with me. 
 - Even if she says that,

423
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:21,060
you still can't let go of her that easily. I am your warning from past experience.

424
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:25,420
But this time,

425
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:28,120
I'm really tired this time.

426
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:31,790
No matter how tired you are, you have to communicate with Siyu.

427
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,960
I remember something you said before.

428
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,020
"If you're a man,

429
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:41,120
you have to take action."

430
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:46,980
He's right. You're a man. You have to take initiative. Go find Siyu and talk.

431
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:59,870
Something happened! If you don't come back, we won't be able to be the best man and bridesmaid!

432
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:02,530
I'll change my flight right now! I'll be back tomorrow!

433
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:33,450
How do I look?

434
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:39,290
Though I haven't fully recovered, the woman standing in front of you right now is the Gu Xiaoling from ten years ago.

435
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:41,490
Let's go.

436
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,400
How is Zhizhi?

437
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:49,420
Say something.

438
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:54,000
I left for only half a month, yet so much has happened.

439
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,600
It seems that I am the one who "home-guards" out of the three of us. 
 (T/N: slang for staying at home all the time instead of going out to have fun and cause trouble)

440
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:01,260
That's right. Not only do you "home-guard," but you also protect against disasters.

441
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:03,920
How do you plan on welcoming me back?

442
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,390
I reserved a restaurant.

443
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:07,370
Just us two?

444
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:10,810
Zhizhi has to go to the hospital to see Liu Yang. She won't make it.

445
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,520
Come in.

446
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,790
Director Fang, please sign this.

447
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,720
Thank you, Director Fang.

448
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:41,950
[Stranger]

449
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:45,350
Director Fang, I have booked a private room at Hanhai Hall.

450
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:48,350
I want to ask about Lubao's future developments.

451
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:51,610
Awaiting your favorable reply, Wang Ziru.

452
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:06,750
I'm going to go to the restroom.

453
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:18,340
I'm here. I'm already inside.

454
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,930
Yes.

455
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,030
Where are you?

456
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:27,660
On the left? The le—

457
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,530
I'm hanging up.

458
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:35,420
Haowen asked me to come here.

459
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,500
How is it?

460
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:44,130
This place has pretty good food.

461
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:46,570
There are lots of good things to eat here. We can get more.

462
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:48,760
The environment is also good.

463
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,350
You're really good at finding places to eat.

464
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:53,130
Of course. Could you ever go wrong with what the God of Food recommends?

465
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:55,470
Here. Let's have a drink.

466
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,560
What are you staring at? Have you never seen a pretty woman before?

467
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:08,880
I have, but I've never seen one as beautiful as you.

468
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,820
The thing is, you're already quite old, yet you can be so beautiful.

469
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:17,130
Lei Haowen, do you want to cut all your ties with me?

470
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:21,000
What do you mean by cutting our ties?

471
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,280
- Lei Haowen! 
 - Hey, don't, don't, don't.

472
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:27,180
I was wrong. I won't say that again. Never again.

473
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:36,020
Here, I'll compensate you. Here, instestines, your favorite food.

474
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:38,270
You've probably missed it, haven't you? Try it.

475
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:49,410
It's still very good.

476
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:58,020
What do you think the two of them are doing right now?

477
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,910
According to my understanding of Chen Yiming,

478
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:05,310
he is probably apologizing and reflecting on his wrongdoings.

479
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:09,850
According to my understanding of Li Siyu, she definitely will become soft-hearted.

480
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:13,780
And then, Yiming will say a few more sweet words,

481
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:16,610
and then Li Siyu won't be able to control her tears.

482
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:18,860
The two of them will hug.

483
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:20,990
They will promise to never separate from each other again.

484
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:23,020
They will reunite.

485
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:25,790
You and I make a great pair of partners in providing great services to mankind.

486
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:29,700
Here, cheers to the best man and bridesmaid getting their jobs back!

487
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,810
I really never expected

488
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:12,520
that losing the position of sales director would hurt you this much.

489
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:16,220
I should've comforted you immediately.

490
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:23,820
But at that time, I didn't think to use your perspective to think about the problem.

491
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:28,110
It was my fault. I'm sorry.

492
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,850
I was also too impulsive that day.

493
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:36,090
No matter what the reason was,

494
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:39,020
I shouldn't have caused such a big scene at your workplace.

495
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,600
Siyu,

496
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:46,290
I think I need to explain this situation again.

497
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:51,520
At that time, Sister Ziru did ask me, s-she asked me about my opinion,

498
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:56,040
and I did say something about not wanting you reinstated,

499
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,900
but I really did say that for myself.

500
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:01,690
I really was just worried about you.

501
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:06,700
When I was at the hospital,

502
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:09,540
looking at your examination report,

503
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:12,950
did you know what my mood was?

504
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:17,340
You've been with me for over five years. You've done so much for me,

505
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:21,720
yet I didn't take care of you well enough.

506
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:26,130
If in the future, I can't even help take care of your body,

507
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:28,620
then what would be the purpose of having me as a husband?

508
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,840
Siyu,

509
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:40,000
let's not break up.

510
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:42,330
Okay?

511
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,180
Let me take care of you.

512
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,360
I know.

513
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:15,640
You want to have your own career.

514
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,740
It's no problem. I will support you.

515
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:26,140
But... our first priority

516
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:28,870
is to better your health.

517
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:35,060
I understand my own health problems.

518
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,520
What do you understand? Huh?

519
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,460
Tell me what you understand.

520
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:42,150
The doctor is the one who makes the decisions.

521
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:45,350
When the doctor says that your body has fully recovered,

522
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:47,790
then I will let you go out there to work hard for your career.

523
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:51,000
When will that be?

524
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:56,150
A year? Two years?

525
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:00,580
This isn't an issue of time.

526
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:04,310
As long as your body gets better, you can go out 
 there whenever you want.

527
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:07,670
Also, we can use this time

528
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:10,340
to take care of our wedding.

529
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:14,160
But my career

530
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:17,410
might be continuously delayed this way.

531
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:22,630
But you... even if you want

532
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:26,420
to work right now, but you can't go back to Lubao anymore.

533
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:30,410
I don't need to go back to Lubao.

534
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:33,280
There are lots of things I can do.

535
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,410
Then, what would you like to do?

536
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:38,970
I want to start my own business.

537
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:42,740
Start a business?

538
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:49,080
Starting a business is a good thing,

539
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:51,680
but can't you start a business at any time?

540
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:55,540
But real opportunities are fleeting.

541
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:57,400
Why are you so anxious?

542
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,360
In the future...

543
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:03,560
Won't there be more suitable times?

544
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:05,900
Because—

545
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:10,310
Because I'm already over 30 years old.

546
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:13,510
Because I just lost

547
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:15,930
everything I had at Lubao,

548
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:20,350
so how could I not be anxious?

549
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:26,050
Siyu...

550
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,790
Why don't you understand?

551
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:36,560
Ever since we've been together,

552
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:39,170
you aren't alone anymore.

553
00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:41,100
You still have me.

554
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:47,950
Everything that is mine is yours.

555
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:53,980
Trust me.

556
00:43:54,770 --> 00:43:58,250
Trust me. I will have the capability

557
00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:01,800
to take care of everything for you.

558
00:44:04,410 --> 00:44:06,690
Let's get married first,

559
00:44:06,690 --> 00:44:10,710
then take care of your health, and then we will take

560
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:14,540
care of everything else one by one.

584
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:56,300
♫  The best way to overcome difficulties is to smile  ♫

585
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:58,340
♫  Are you afraid of all the punishment given by fate?  ♫

♫  Let everything go, all those concerns, real or fake  ♫

587
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:03,710
♫  Cannot erase the scar, but it's just a scar  ♫

588
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:05,330
♫  We are so small yet so determined  ♫

589
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:07,180
♫  Occasionally fussy and occasionally firm  ♫

590
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:09,510
♫  If growth leaves a trace, then the trace is left be tears  ♫

591
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:13,190
♫  Your back that I've always been chasing  ♫

592
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:15,330
♫  Finally turned around to hug me tightly  ♫

593
00:46:15,330 --> 00:46:18,960
♫  It's still that familiar you  ♫

594

♫  Dear Myself  ♫

597
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:35,090
♫  Listen to the voice inside  ♫

598
00:46:35,090 --> 00:46:39,160
♫  I'll give you the warm that the wind took  ♫

599
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:41,480
♫  Hugging you, hugging me  ♫
