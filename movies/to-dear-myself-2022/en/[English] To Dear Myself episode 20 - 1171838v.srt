00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,090
[Episode 20]

4
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:38,390
Come in.

5
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:42,710
Director Li, Xiaoshi Group is asking for their order to be delivered earlier.

6
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:45,100
I remember that the contract we signed said that it was to be delivered next month.

7
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:49,220
Yes, but their production plan just changed, and they are hoping that we can cooperate.

8
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,330
What does the production group say?

9
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:53,670
I asked, but they said that there was no way they can produce that much in time.

10
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,940
Then give the merchandise originally for the General Group to them.

11
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:59,970
The General Group...  Are they not your clients?

12
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:02,690
Yes, they are my old friends, so I understand their situation.

13
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:05,410
They will be fine with a half a month delay.

14
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:07,370
Thank you, Director Li.

15
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:13,180
What's the situation with the Red Rose Electric Car?

16
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:18,710
We've been talking to their vice president for a month, but we haven't gotten any breakthroughs.

17
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:21,960
Wait a moment.

18
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:33,580
This is my analysis for the electric car market where I have also integrated Lubao's products.

19
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:36,560
Take a look and see if you can make a breakthrough from this angle.

20
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:40,650
This really is what I needed.

21
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:42,700
It's my treasure. Keep it a secret.

22
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,210
I got it. Thanks, Director Li.

23
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:46,870
Go work.

24
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,910
Sister Siyu.

25
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:00,570
In the past, I was worried that since I was a part of Sister Yuan's team,

26
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:04,440
that you would bully me when I start working for you.

27
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:09,410
But I really didn't expect that not only did you not mind, but you also went out of your way to help me.

28
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:15,120
In the past, I didn't see you as someone capable enough to serve, but now I do.

29
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,960
I was actually mentored by Sister Yuan.

30
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,310
Even though in the end, there were some misunderstandings,

31
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:24,410
but I remember how Sister Yuan helped me.

32
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:27,840
Everything I'm doing now was taught to me by Sister Yuan.

33
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,670
There are many areas in which you are similar to her.

34
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:33,510
Of course, there are also many areas where you two differ.

35
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:36,440
Oh, right. What has she been doing recently?

36
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,930
She opened a dining bar.

37
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:40,740
That seems like a huge difference.

38
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:44,670
She says that by opening a dining bar, her son can have a warm meal at any time,

39
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:48,530
and it's also very close to the school, so she can talk to the teachers easily.

40
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,330
Go work.

41
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,530
Be careful.

42
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:52,910
Try to find a thicker vein to stick into.

43
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,790
Didn't I say to find a thicker one?

44
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:13,600
How many times have you poked by now? How much blood have you spilled already? Are you capable?

45
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:18,140
What are you trying to turn my mom into?

46
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:20,470
I told you to do it lightly! Look, it's all swollen now.

47
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:22,360
You have already poked her three times.

48
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,390
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.

49
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:27,020
This family member, please calm down. If you have any problems, please let me know.

50
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:29,200
Please get me a different nurse for this.

51
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,320
This nurse has no issues with her technique.

52
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,440
She's new so she may be nervous. Could you please cooperate?

53
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,260
Okay, okay. I'll cooperate. More or less, it's the same. It doesn't hurt.

54
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:41,060
This is flesh! How could it not hurt?

55
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,640
Change the nurse for me. Change her right now.

56
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,780
Okay, okay. Please wait a moment. I'll get you a different nurse.

57
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:52,020
Let me take a look. She poked you three times. What was wrong with her?

58
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,610
It's fine. I'm really fine.

59
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:55,820
How could you be fine? She...

60
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:04,970
Zhizhi, look... During this period of time, you've been at the hospital, at work,

61
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:09,510
at home, taking care of the child, and me. You are tired, right?

62
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:12,710
I'm fine.

63
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,690
I'm such a burden to you.

64
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:30,260
Mom, let me get you some water and help you wash up.

65
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,440
No, no, no.

66
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:36,540
I haven't showered in many days. I smell horrible.

67
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,960
Do you think I will be ashamed of you?

68
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:42,820
No, I'm ashamed of myself.

69
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,780
Look... My mom died early. I didn't really get to take care of her.

70
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:52,490
I'll take this as making up for a missed opportunity.

71
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:56,620
When did your mother die?

72
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,430
When I was 19 years old.

73
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,040
Poor child.

74
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,350
In the past, I also bickered with her all the time.

75
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:10,250
So sometimes when I bickered with you, I hope you didn't take it personally.

76
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:13,110
I didn't.

77
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:25,600
That's enough. Don't be so busy. Sit down and talk to me.

78
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,760
Zhizhi,

79
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:53,570
your illness... don't give up.

80
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:57,660
There must be hope. Medical science is advancing now.

81
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:02,750
We can go to a large hospital and find great doctors. You can succeed.

82
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:07,000
Mom, have you not given up on having a grandson?

83
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,900
I can't give up on that. I can't.

84
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,780
Not only for our Liu family,

85
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:16,950
but it's also for you, silly girl.

86
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:23,370
Mom, it's not important whether it's a girl or a boy. It's filial piety that's most important.

87
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:26,920
Take a look at the auntie on the bed next to you. She has three sons,

88
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:30,950
but what's the use? They are all not filial. It would've been better if she didn't have them.

89
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,390
That's true.

90
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,200
This time, we couldn't get enough for the surgery.

91
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,980
It was my female cousin who took the initiative to pay what's left.

92
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,250
Your female cousin?

93
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,650
Female cousin...

94
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:53,150
In the past, I always heard Liu Yang talk about how his father passed early.

95
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:56,730
You were the one who singlehandedly brought him and his younger sister up.

96
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:02,450
If we're talking about capabilities, then how many of the males in your village could've possibly been more capable than you?

97
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:09,950
Mom, we're both also females.

98
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:12,620
Why would we look down on women?

99
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,920
Listen to what you say. I didn't say I looked down on women.

100
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,470
I just think that having a son makes me feel more at ease.

101
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:30,700
After getting sick, I have thought about a lot of things.

102
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,750
Say, once a person passes away,

103
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:37,650
that person can't control anything.

104
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:40,860
From now on, everything will be up to you guys.

105
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:45,060
Okay? Go do whatever you guys want to do.

106
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:49,420
Mom.

107
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:52,760
Zhizhi, in the past,

108
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,360
I did many things wrong.

109
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,910
Please don't take it to heart. Don't hate me.

110
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:02,170
What are you saying?

111
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:13,760
Where's Liu Yang?

112
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,450
I feel like each day, I barely even get to see his shadow.

113
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,800
He's busy with work.

114
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,840
- Work? 
 - Yes.

115
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:26,030
There are very many female colleagues in the workplace.

116
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,220
There are many young female colleagues as well.

117
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:34,060
He's always walking around with those little girls.

118
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:40,240
You... You need to be more concerned.

119
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:45,930
Mom, I trust Liu Yang. It's going to be all right.

120
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:49,870
- Let's wash up. 
 - All right. All right.

121
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:08,780
I heard that our superiors have already started to discuss about the candidates for the Deputy Director position.

122
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:12,950
If all goes well, then it will be you.

123
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:16,700
If I become the deputy director, then it will be partly because of you.

124
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,990
I didn't do anything!

125
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:24,460
You don't have to do anything. Just like this, staying by my side every day

126
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,530
makes me feel much less stressed.

127
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:34,500
Hey. What's wrong, Brother Yang?

128
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:39,750
Nothing. I think it's just low blood sugar.

129
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,910
Let's go over there and rest for a bit.

130
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,790
Be careful.

131
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:54,740
Brother Yang, you've gotten much skinnier these past two days. Are you really tired?

132
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:58,900
My mom is in the hospital and there's a lot to do at work.

133
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,950
How could I not be tired?

134
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:06,980
I really wish I could take care of your mom in your place.

135
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:18,270
The good thing is that in two days, she can be discharged.

136
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:22,290
Then I'll go visit her in these two days.

137
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,440
If I wait until she's discharged, I'll have no opportunity.

138
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,860
It's not suitable for me to go to your house to visit.

139
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:33,700
I've met her once and we chatted very happily.

140
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:36,270
Don't you want her to be a little happier?

141
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,280
All right then.

142
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,930
Write properly. Why are you randomly drawing again?

143
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:48,270
Check!

144
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:50,060
Okay, coming.

145
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,930
Write.

146
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,200
It's ¥53 in total. You are still missing ¥3.

147
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,440
That's not right. It should be ¥50.

148
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,380
It's ¥53.

149
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:06,760
This is ¥16, ¥14, and ¥20.

150
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,000
It's like this. These two dishes' prices were raised.

151
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,500
Just let it be ¥50.

152
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,230
I'm really sorry, but we are a small business so I can't do that.

153
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:17,300
Look, I come here to eat every single day.

154
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,670
You should at least give this little discount.

155
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:23,170
I can't give you a discount. ¥53.

156
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:31,760
I'm never coming here again.

157
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:04,660
Sister Yuan.

158
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,150
Why are you here?

159
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:09,750
I heard that you opened a dining bar and came to take a look.

160
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,750
Are you done looking? If you are, then leave.

161
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,740
I haven't eaten yet.

162
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,200
I want to order two-topping noodles.

163
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,020
They're sold out.

164
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,940
- Then spicy noodles would work, too. 
 - Don't have any.

165
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:42,480
Are you still angry at me?

166
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,070
I'm angry at myself. I married a bad husband and I made bad friends.

167
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,750
Sister Yuan, we've known each other for seven years.

168
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,240
Even though the last three months were extremely unpleasant,

169
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,110
but in the days before that,

170
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:58,570
we were always the best master and disciple; the best friends.

171
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:02,090
The last three months negate everything before that.

172
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:05,040
We both had faults in the last three months.

173
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,930
At least I wasn't the one who started the conflict.

174
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:14,250
Who let down whom the most, who hurt whom the most,

175
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,450
that's already no longer clear now.

176
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,890
Since it's not clear, we might as well just write it off.

177
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:30,380
The method you used to become the sales director hurt me,

178
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:33,080
yet now you're saying we should just forget it all?

179
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:36,650
Li Siyu, aren't you too greedy?

180
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:39,660
Sister Yuan, I didn't hurt you.

181
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:46,910
Let's wait for when I become the sales director again,

182
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,840
and then we can talk about writing it all off.

183
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:56,410
Sister Yuan!

184
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:59,740
I'm closing. Leave.

185
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,250
28%!

186
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,550
22%!

187
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:33,850
22%. This share offer

188
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:36,900
will only be valid within 24 hours.

189
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:40,350
Otherwise, I will really end the negotiation with you.

190
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,340
President Wang, is there anything else you need me to do?

191
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,970
No. You can go home.

192
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:14,510
Okay.

193
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:24,380
[Reading Area]

194
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:42,100
- You're still working overtime? 
 - President Wang.

195
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:44,870
It's time to get off work.

196
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:48,060
I still have a few e-mails. I'll get off work once I reply to them.

197
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,700
Have you not even eaten your dinner?

198
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,910
Once I got busy, I forgot about it.

199
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:56,340
I haven't eaten either. I'll treat you.

200
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:59,710
Oh, sure.

201
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:02,190
Then I'll clean up.

202
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,240
How about we call Siyu?

203
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:14,190
If she's available, we can eat together.

204
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:18,650
Siyu... Siyu is definitely going to work overtime today.

205
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,870
That's unfortunate.

206
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:34,380
I heard that the superiors have already started discussing about promoting Liu Yang to Deputy Director.

207
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,790
Mr. Wu, if you continue to not take action,

208
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:39,160
then you will have no chance in this lifetime.

209
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,670
Rest assured.

210
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:47,780
On the day they announce that Lubao won the bid,

211
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:50,900
I will have already made my move.

212
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:53,800
Then, how come there is still nothing going on?

213
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,020
It's coming.

214
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:01,700
Before you came, I had actually reached a deadlock with my negotiation with Lubao,

215
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:06,300
but your report on investigating Lubao3 not only broke the deadlock,

216
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:09,440
but also pushed the negotiation forward a huge step.

217
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:13,410
Then it looks like I'm still somewhat useful.

218
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:16,700
I should've treated you to this meal long ago to thank you for adding value to the company.

219
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,790
No, I need to thank you, President Wang, for providing me with such a great platform.

220
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,240
Thank you.

221
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,900
Yiming,

222
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:32,060
were you the one who wrote the newest work plan for the Planning Department?

223
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,800
Yes.

224
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:38,000
After reading it, I found some contradictions.

225
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,490
Tianye Group is kind of dull right now,

226
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:42,980
but your proposal

227
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:46,630
changes people's understanding of the traditional financial field.

228
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:48,850
Of course, if Tianye Group does not change,

229
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:50,440
then there wouldn't be great progress that can be made.

230
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,910
However, if we change completely according to your plan, it seems too risky.

231
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:56,480
GM Wang, this step seems risky, but it has huge benefits.

232
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:01,010
Most of the financial institutions in China right now

233
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:03,410
do not take brands into account when building strategic assets for marketing.

234
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,270
So whoever takes that step first,

235
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:08,070
will become the winner of the whole market.

236
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:13,120
You don't have to be so anxious in persuading me.

237
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,610
Let me think about it.

238
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:17,210
Sure.

239
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:23,030
However, there is one point that I'm certain of right now.

240
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:25,860
Putting you in the position of Planning Director

241
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,990
may have been a mistake.

242
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:32,240
With your talent, insight, and perspective,

243
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,110
you deserve to stand on a bigger platform.

244
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,510
President Wang, I will drink this.

245
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,470
Drink less.

246
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,420
Waiter,

247
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,170
please add a few more dishes.

248
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:52,230
No need, President Wang. This is enough.

249
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:55,310
There are a few dishes that Siyu really likes. Take them back for her.

250
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:57,570
There's really no need. Tonight—

251
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:02,820
Tonight, Siyu and I... will not meet tonight.

252
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,520
You won't meet?

253
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,370
If you guys are not meeting up, then you can deliver it to her.

254
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:11,550
There's really no need, President Wang. Siyu and I...

255
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:17,060
Actually, we haven't talked in a week.

256
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:21,720
Why?

257
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,590
I'm sorry. Is it something that I shouldn't have asked about?

258
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:28,960
No, no. I just think...

259
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:33,890
no matter how close of a relationship two people have together,

260
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:36,460
there are some problems

261
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:39,640
that are impossible to communicate about.

262
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,940
What exactly happened?

263
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:50,930
Siyu is very competitive and subjective.

264
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:54,640
I advise her that some things can be done while others should not be done.

265
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,540
There are some things that if she does, people will think that she is playing dirty to get a high sales performance,

266
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,380
but she...

267
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,570
She thinks that me advising her this is me being selfish.

268
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:07,820
That... That I have other motives.

269
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:13,370
Could it be that Pan Zhiyong is giving her too much pressure?

270
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:16,910
Yes. President Pan has put the finance, the sales performance,

271
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:19,880
and even the entire future of Lubao onto her shoulders.

272
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,240
The pressure she has is unimaginably large.

273
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:30,290
However... However, no matter how much pressure you have, you must have morals and limits.

274
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:32,320
I agree with that.

275
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:40,810
You don't need to be so anxious and don't force her. Just give her some time.

276
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:44,560
Siyu is such a smart girl. She'll understand.

277
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:51,800
I'm sorry, President Wang. Today, I drank too much so I talked a little too much.

278
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,950
Eat some food.

279
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:54,630
Okay.

280
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:04,140
Take care.

281
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,570
Thank you.

282
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:11,880
Do you really not need me to take you home?

283
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,720
No need, I'm fine.

284
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,630
Then I'm leaving now.

285
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:16,110
Okay.

286
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:22,650
See you at the company tomorrow.

287
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:24,390
See you at the company tomorrow.

288
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:43,190
I think we can respond to Pan Zhiyong now.

289
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:45,820
¥800 million and 25%?

290
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:48,930
No. He wouldn't let the negotiation fall through.

291
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:52,310
He really needs money right now. Yes.

292
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:56,240
His stress is way bigger than we had imagined.

293
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:58,380
Okay.

Hello, I am Li Siyu from Lubao.

Hello, Mister Tang.

297
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:12,110

298
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:14,390
Okay, please wait a moment.

[Hengshan Rd. Station]

300
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:27,710
Hey, Manager Tang, I'll tell you now.

301
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:31,740
18650 is 10.4 watt-hour.

302
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:35,860
18650A is 11.2 watt-hour.

303
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,870
Our 21700 is

304
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:40,600
17.76 watt-hour.

305
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,320
Yes. That's settled then.

306
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,460
Then I'll contact you later.

307
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,610
Your leg hurts often, so I bought you this.

308
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:10,580
Wrap it like this.

309
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:13,900
Then, plug it in.

310
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:17,520
This way you can have a massage. It can even be heated.

311
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,150
- How much did this cost? 
 - Not much, a little over ¥300.

312
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:23,290
Over ¥300? That expensive?

313
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,370
I don't want it. I really don't want it.

314
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:29,200
When my leg hurts, I can just use my hand to massage it. Return it, we don't need to waste this money.

315
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,770
Really.

316
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:34,190
Put it on. It's not expensive. How does this count as expensive?

317
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:37,170
Before, Liu Yang gifted me a cup, that was expensive.

318
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:39,390
It was over ¥200.

319
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:42,800
I went to return it, but they just gave me a voucher.

320
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:46,540
I used the voucher and added ¥100 to buy this.

321
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:49,100
That's still over ¥300.

322
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:52,760
As long as your leg feels better, ¥300 is fine.

323
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:55,150
- Oh, you. 
 - Here, let's try it.

324
00:26:57,530 --> 00:26:59,760
How is it? Is it hot yet?

325
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,390
It's hot now. It even shakes a little.

326
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:05,490
Auntie, Xiaoling and I are here to see you today.

327
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:08,450
- Oh, you guys came. 
 - Auntie, how are you now?

328
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:11,810
Better, I'm getting better and better. Thank you for coming to see me.

00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:14,320
Bed 34, it's your turn.

00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,140
- Get this off. 
 - Slowly.

00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:21,450
Okay, you talk amongst yourselves. I have to go for a small exam.

332
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:24,760
- Do you want us to come with you? 
 - No need, the doctor will be with me.

333
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:28,070
Talk amongst yourselves. Let's go.

00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:29,960
- Careful. 
 - Okay.

 - Yes.

Here, sit.

about our mom's surgery fee. We'll pay it back to you in installments.

Aiyo, I don't urgently need it.

342
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:01,080
We'll talk about it once you guys are not so tight on money.

00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:05,420
After my mom is discharged, you and Xiaoling should come over for dinner.

344
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:08,490
Bring Brother Yiming and your boyfriend.

345
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:11,650
Why have so many people over? Xiaoling and I are enough.

346
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:14,070
No, we definitely have to invite Brother Yiming.

347
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:18,550
I just don't know if inviting your boyfriend to my house is appropriate or not.

348
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:21,360
I'll ask Weixiang and see when he is available.

349
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:27,870
Did you have an argument with Chen Yiming again?

350
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:31,410
Why?

351
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,360
It's just a small issue.

352
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:37,920
How long have you been fighting for?

353
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,080
We've haven't talked for more than a week.

354
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,430
A small issue yet you haven't talked for more than a week?

355
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:44,250
Enough. Let's not talk about that.

356
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:47,210
Hey, Xiaoling. There's something I need you to help me do.

357
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:51,480
Let's talk about this first. You two are about to get married. Fighting like this isn't normal.

358
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:55,570
I'm begging you guys. Can we not talk about it?

359
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,990
Xiaoling,

360
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,860
I'm at work.

361
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,930
Are you coming to see me?

362
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:40,380
No...

363
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:44,360
You are suddenly being so nice to me. I'm not used to it.

364
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:49,730
Let's do this. At 12:45 p.m.,

365
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:51,720
wait for me at the company's entrance.

366
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,280
Don't be early or late.

367
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,030
Okay.

368
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:03,640
In a bit, I'll treat everyone to lunch.

369
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:05,810
Really? That's great!

370
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:08,130
- Is hairy crabs all right? 
 - Yes. Thank you.

371
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:11,160
- Thank you, Brother Lei. 
 - Thank you, Brother Lei.

372
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:18,060
You finally came. Did you know, these past few days,

373
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:20,430
your wife had to take care of me and Yuwei—

374
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:22,920
Mom, this is Xiao Wei from work.

375
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:26,180
Aunt, hello. I came to see you.

376
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,840
Come, sit down.

377
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:33,820
You guys are so busy at work, yet you still made a trip to see me.

378
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:36,020
No matter how busy I am, I still have to come and see you.

379
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:40,270
Auntie, your complexion is so good. It looks like you recovered well.

380
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:43,610
Auntie Qiao, have you seen this thing?

381
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:45,950
My daughter-in-law bought this for me.

382
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:48,700
My daughter-in-law treats me so well.

383
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:53,870
She feeds me this and that as well as buys me things.

384
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:58,520
A few days ago, my son bought my daughter-in-law a thermal mug.

385
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,190
It was over 200 RMB.

386
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:02,700
My daughter-in-law returned the thermal mug

387
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:05,170
and added 100 RMB to get this for me.

388
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:07,650
This thing, when you wrap it around your leg and plug it in,

389
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:10,200
it gets warm. It's very comfortable.

390
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,190
- This is called a massaging device. 
 - Oh, wow. That's hard to get.

391
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:15,740
- I also want one. 
 - Aunt,

392
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:18,150
I'll go wash you some fruit.

393
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:31,340
Why did you bring her here?

394
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,840
She has good intentions. She wanted to see you.

395
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,050
What is there to see? Aren't you afraid that you guys will bump into your wife?

396
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:39,690
Zhizhi is at work right now.

397
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:42,730
You... You better cut it off with her.

398
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:44,560
Mom, cut what off?

399
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:47,380
Cut what off? You're my son.

400
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:50,510
- Do you think I wouldn't know your thoughts? 
 - Mom,  you should rest—

401
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:54,790
Zhizhi is honest and sincere towards you.

402
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,130
But to save money,

403
00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:01,590
she changed the imported medicine into domestic medicine. I can't forgive her.

404
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:05,930
I was the one who asked the doctor to change the medicine.

405
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:10,060
Don't you know how expensive imported medicine costs? You also can't get reimbursed.

406
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:12,100
- You were the one who asked for the change? 
 - That's right.

407
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:15,330
Zhizhi didn't know about it.

408
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,730
Why are you staring at me?

409
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:22,370
I'm telling you... Only being admitted into the hospital,

410
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:25,140
I realized how rare it is to find a wife like Zhizhi.

411
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,360
You need to cherish her.

412
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,520
Quickly break it off with this girl.

413
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:33,340
From now on, live your life with Zhizhi.

414
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:35,200
Mom, it's really not what you think.

415
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,590
What am I thinking of?

416
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:41,790
Break it off. You must break it off. Completely.

417
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:47,370
What? Do you want to anger me to death?

418
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:49,240
No, Mom.

419
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:52,980
Sit, sit, sit. I got it, I got it..

420
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:56,420
Auntie, eat some fruits.

421
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:14,770
Mom is a bit tired. How about this?

422
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:16,900
You go back first.

423
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:21,860
Auntie, rest well.

424
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,700
I'm leaving now.

425
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,270
Thanks for coming to see me.

426
00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:15,950
- Look! A hot girl! 
 - What hot girl?

427
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:18,370
That's a goddess.

428
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:23,210
What's wrong, Brother Lei?

429
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:27,130
- Why did she wait there? 
 - Who?

430
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:29,050
Is she here for you?

431
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,610
Stop acting.

432
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:35,120
I don't believe that she knows you.

433
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,370
She really is my ex-girlfriend.

434
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:41,610
I told her that I didn't like her anymore, but she keeps clinging onto me.

435
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:43,850
We broke up months ago.

436
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:49,050
In a bit, I'll make a detour over there to get back to the company.

437
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:52,180
You guys help me. Say you didn't see me.

438
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:55,890
Haowen. Lei Haowen.

439
00:34:55,890 --> 00:34:59,220
The crabs from lunch were good, next time...

440
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:01,660
So you were here?

441
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,180
Are you looking for me?

442
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,840
Obviously, who else would I be looking for?

443
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,570
Did you wait a long time?

444
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:25,170
What do you think?

445
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:26,740
The wind is big out here.

446
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:29,470
There's a coffee shop up ahead. We can talk as we walk.

447
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:31,210
Lead the way.

448
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:32,840
Got it.

449
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:36,950
Has Chen Yiming been acting strange recently?

450
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:39,760
- What are you doing? 
 - Taking pictures.

451
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,330
Stop it!

452
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:45,580
Look, Xiaoling. How come your lipstick is smudged?

453
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:49,400
Are you talking about Yiming? I haven't seen him in a while.

454
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,090
What's he been busy with?

455
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:54,930
Busy with work. Didn't he just join a company?

456
00:35:56,710 --> 00:36:01,170
Say, they are at the stage of the relationship where they're about to get married, why would they fight like this?

457
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:04,340
Who said that you can't argue just because you are about to get married?

458
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:07,650
But not talking to each other for a week is too abnormal, right?

459
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:12,840
Then if the two of us fought, how long would be considered normal?

460
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,930
How could our relationship possibly be the same as theirs?

461
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:22,620
How is it not? Each relationship is between a male and female.

462
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,650
I will give you a task.

463
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:28,160
I will most definitely complete it.

464
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,100
Are you not going to ask what the task is?

465
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:35,280
I either have to sell my soul or devote myself to something. I'm good at both.

466
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,890
- Mom. 
 - Hey, you're here?

467
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:38,010
- How are you today? 
 - Give it to me.

468
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:39,150
Pretty good.

469
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:40,990
I stewed you some fish soup.

470
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,410
Do want to eat it now or later?

471
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:44,950
Later. I'm not hungry right now.

472
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:49,380
- Sit down and rest for a bit first. You're too tired. 
 - I'm fine.

473
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:51,140
Zhizhi, rest for a while. I can do it.

474
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:56,810
I even steamed a squab for you. It's said that it can heal heart problems.

475
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:58,860
Squab?

476
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:00,500
That can't be cheap, right?

477
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:09,860
Hey, did someone come and see you today?

478
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:15,020
What? Oh, a few of Liu Yang's colleagues came.

479
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,580
Oh.

480
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:22,320
I'll go wash the chopsticks and spoon for you.

481
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,250
Give them to me. I'll go.

482
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:31,960
See? Such a great wife. What else could you want?

483
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,020
Zhizhi,

484
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:58,100
the changing medicine thing had nothing to do with you. I wrongly blamed you.

485
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:07,620
Please don't be angry, all right? I was wrong.

486
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:09,360
I apologize.

487
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:13,210
All you know how to do is bully me.

488
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,720
How about this? Hit me a few times to release your anger.

489
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:03,420
Hello, Yayun?

490
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:05,190
Are you at work?

491
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:09,240
Please wait for me there after work. I have to talk to you about something.

492
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:27,780
Brother Yang?

493
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:31,500
What's wrong with your foot?

494
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:35,950
It kind of hurts. I'm guessing it's because I've walked too much these days.

495
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:37,470
Then I'll go buy you some medicinal patches.

496
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:39,490
No need.

497
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:45,960
Yayun,

498
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,820
I have something to tell you.

499
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:55,470
Wait.

500
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:08,490
I have a present for you.

501
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:10,200
What?

502
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:15,100
I knitted this myself.

503
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:18,410
I also embroidered this myself.

504
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:22,100
For me?

505
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,050
What do you think?

506
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:33,090
I'll tie it for you.

507
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:44,570
It suits you quite well.

508
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,900
I stayed up for several nights.

509
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:54,400
You could have just bought one.

510
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,370
Things like this cost so much time and effort.

511
00:40:56,370 --> 00:41:00,160
No. I want to knit it thread by thread

512
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:04,310
and embroider it stitch one-by-one. This way, it has meaning.

513
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:10,500
When it starts to get windy, wear it.

514
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:19,170
Okay.

515
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:27,890
How come Yiming is still not here yet?

516
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,660
- I'm here. 
 - What took you so long?

517
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:35,950
You're so anxious. Isn't there no ballgame today?

518
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,920
We can't sit together without a ballgame?

519
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:43,450
Could it be that we are brothers only on the surface?

520
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:48,460
Liu Yang's mom is still in the hospital. I really have been quite busy these days.

521
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:50,940
You've already come, so you might as well sit with us.

522
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:52,240
Look.

523
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,990
Who is the real sweet guy?

524
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:01,700
Liu Yang, how's your mom's condition?

525
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:05,610
She's already been discharged. She's planning to go back to our hometown to rest in a few days.

526
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:07,390
That's good.

527
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:09,530
Let's talk about you.

528
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:11,360
Thank you.

529
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,700
What happened between you and Siyu?

530
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:17,050
How did you know?

531
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:20,770
What's my relationship with Gu Xiaoling right now?

532
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:30,580
Liu Yang,

533
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:32,990
there is a serious problem with what Li Siyu did.

534
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:35,770
What problem?

535
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:39,710
In order to avoid suspicion, she should have backed out of the bid.

536
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,280
Yiming, you are overthinking.

537
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:47,400
Although I'm the team leader of the bidding, what I do is a supportive job.

538
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:53,040
The experts decide. When they evaluate, I can only stand at the door. I can't even enter the room.

539
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,680
But the risk is still very large.

540
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:59,700
At my workplace, there is risk everywhere.

541
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:03,310
Unless you are unselfish and have no desire.

542
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:07,540
I think you shouldn't blame Siyu anymore.

543
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:12,040
I need to thank her for paying my mom's hospitalization expenses.

544
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:20,980
I understand now. If you argued with Siyu about this,

545
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:23,000
since Liu Yang has declared his opinion,

546
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,070
then just let it go.

547
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:27,110
I think she shouldn't have done things in that way.

548
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:28,960
Why not?

549
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:33,230
Yiming, you are good at a lot of things but you are too fussy.

550
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:36,600
It's such a small issue yet you are making it such a big deal.

551
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,540
What are you talking about?

552
00:43:39,870 --> 00:43:44,020
Did I say it wrong? Think more about Siyu's good qualities.

553
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:46,720
She's been with you for so many years.

554
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,720
Has she ever spent your money?

555
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:52,270
She cries with you, laughs with you. She has fun with you.

556
00:43:52,270 --> 00:43:54,320
She even repays the mortgage with you

557
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:59,270
and pays the down payment with you. There not many good girls like Siyu nowadays.

558
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:00,380
Those are two different things.

559
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:03,140
How? This is one thing.

560
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:05,300
We can't let Siyu, such a good girl—

561
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:08,030
How-How did it become "we"?

562
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:09,550
Huh?

563
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:11,590
You, you, you, you.

564
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:15,350
Take the initiative to make peace. Then, you can start your happy life together.

565
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,580
I can also give Xiaoling an explanation on my end.

566
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:27,170
I will tell her that you don't have a mistress.

567
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:30,890
You don't have the seven-year itch. You don't have a marriage phobia.

568
00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:32,530
It's just your regular fussy self.

569
00:44:32,530 --> 00:44:34,240
Wait.

570
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:37,000
They suspect that I have a mistress?

571
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,760
Look at yourself. You haven't been normal recently.

572
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:43,050
Their imagination is too rich.

573
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:45,750
Women.

574
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:52,700
Haowen, did they talk about me?

575
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:54,860
You? No.
