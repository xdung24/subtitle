00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:33,890
[Episode 9]

4
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:52,110
Hello, Mr. Liu.

5
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,730
Hello.

6
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,060
You forgot about 2017's data in the report you gave to the director yesterday.

7
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,100
It's okay. I added it for you.

8
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,720
Pay attention in the future.

9
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,210
Thank you, Mr. Liu.

10
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,820
It's nothing.

11
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,370
Mr. Liu,

12
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:18,340
I wasn't the one at fault last time.

13
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,780
It was Mr. Wu who made me write it like that.

14
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,730
I even specially asked him if it would be approved like that or not.

15
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:27,130
He told me not to worry about it.

16
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,180
Really?

17
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:34,980
I even heard him calling someone, saying

18
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:40,020
as long as you make another mistake, you won't be able to become the team leader.

19
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:45,600
It's a pity you've already started to suspect him so that guy took the chance.

20
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,390
Who is "that guy"?

21
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:50,950
I don't know about that.

22
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:55,810
Mr. Liu, be careful.

23
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,800
Hello?

24
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,390
Yes. Yes, it's me.

25
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:46,290
He didn't tell other people about that thing.

26
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,860
Come out for a moment. I have something to talk to you about.

27
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,100
Mr. Liu.

28
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:48,940
Why didn't old Wu avoid you when he made the phone call?

29
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,870
I was too homesick that evening so I cried in the corner.

30
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:57,120
He thought there was no one in the office.

31
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,420
Have you told other people about this?

32
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,010
I haven't told anyone.

33
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,010
Why did you tell me then?

34
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:06,900
Mr. Liu, you are a good person.

35
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,590
I don't want you to get played by them.

36
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:22,590
Mr. Liu, you must trust me!

37
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:26,190
You are so nice to me. I would never lie to you.

38
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,750
I trust you.

39
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:37,270
Then... what do you plan to do?

40
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:40,210
I'm fixing the plan.

41
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:44,250
The most urgent thing now is to verify all the data.

42
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,160
That's... Isn't that a huge workload?

43
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,400
Yes. I definitely won't be able to finish it by myself.

44
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:57,410
Mr. Liu, I can help you.

45
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:59,680
I can do overtime and stay up.

46
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,570
Thank you.

47
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:05,210
Even if I include you, it's still difficult to finish.

48
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:11,270
The most important thing is to find the hidden "nail" Old Wu placed on my team. 
 (T/N: the person creating trouble)

49
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,260
Xiao Tian, it's your turn.

50
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,240
Sister Siyu. Sister Siyu!

51
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,110
- Everyone. Take a look over there. 
 - Are you all pigs?

52
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:25,800
You just look at me every day. Are you guys waiting for someone to feed you? 

53
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,500
Do you think you can take orders just by sitting in the office? Sales depend on legs! Get out there! Move!

54
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:34,500
Why are you standing here? If you can't reach the sales target for this month then leave!

55
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,910
Sister Yuan is yelling at everyone. She is about to breakdown.

56
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:40,790
What are you all doing? Get out!

57
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:44,940
Of course, they are about to breakdown. We've already exceeded them!

58
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:49,050
Don't talk about others. Xiao Jia, report your number.

59
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:52,310
¥2,000,000 this week.

60
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:54,320
¥2,400,000.

61
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:56,490
Sister Siyu,...

62
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,390
¥2,500,000.

63
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:02,200
- Sis, I can't. 
 - ¥2,600,000.

64
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:05,040
Fine.

65
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,230
¥2,600,000 then.

66
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,660
¥2,600,000. Work hard!

67
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,950
Lin Ling, where are you? Why aren't you here for the meeting?

68
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:18,830
Sister Siyu, come rescue me!

69
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:22,830
- What's wrong? 
 - I've been talking to Meiyi Group's representative for three months.

70
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:25,290
We were going to finalize the contents of the contract today,

71
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:27,050
but Liu Jie came as well.

72
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:29,660
It's your client, why did she go?

73
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,680
I can't explain to you on the phone.

74
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,980
Come quickly! I don't think I can handle her myself.

75
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,300
Wait for me.

76
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,260
You guys continue.

77
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:11,330
Didn't Li Siyu teach you about the company's rules and regulations?

78
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:14,090
- Sister Yuan. 
 - What rules and regulations?

79
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:16,820
Meiyi Group was filed by Liu Jie. It has nothing to do with you.

80
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,190
- But she had given up. 
 - I've never said this.

81
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:21,930
- You said it personally— 
 - That's enough. Stop. Go back.

82
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:25,780
I won't. I've been following up on this client for three months. Why should I give it to you guys?

83
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,950
It's not "give." I'm telling you to quit.

84
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,880
Why quit?

85
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:35,950
- You also came? 
 - Sister Yuan, we have to be reasonable.

86
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:40,360
Liu Jie didn't want this client. Lin ling picked it up. She has been working hard on it for three months.

87
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:44,850
Now that the deal is almost closed, Liu Jie wants to take it back. Who would be willing to let it go?

88
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:49,190
Who said Liu Jie gave up? She just put it aside for a moment.

89
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:53,610
Sometimes the client needs to be dealt in a cold way. Didn't I teach you this?

90
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:55,750
Thank you for your lesson back then.

91
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:59,770
I remember Sister Yuan also taught me to seize the opportunity and not let it go.

92
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:01,820
I passed that lesson to Lin Ling.

93
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:05,280
Don't talk smack with me. The company has its rules and regulations.

94
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,020
Even rules and regulations must be reasonable.

95
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,820
Hello, Director Luo.

96
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,400
- Director Luo. 
 - My bad, my bad.

97
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,570
Our original appointment was at 3:00 p.m.

98
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:19,190
But I was having lunch with the mayor. So I'm a bit late.

99
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:20,420
It all right.

100
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:23,280
Director Luo, do you still remember me?

101
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,250
- You are also from Lubao Group, right? 
 - That's right.

102
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,700
Hi, Director Luo.

103
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,980
I'm the Sales Manager of Lubao Group, Li Siyu.

104
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,320
Okay.

105
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,970
Director Luo,

106
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:38,930
I'm the Sales Director of Lubao Group, Yuan Huizhong.

107
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:43,960
You have so many people here.

108
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:48,000
That's right. It's so you can see our sincerity and your importance.

109
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,620
- Who do I discuss with? 
 - Me!

110
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:54,440
Director Luo, I was the one who was communicating with you before.

111
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:58,530
There are a lot of details that only I know. If you discuss it with me, it will save you time.

112
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:02,200
Then that means.... Are you guys not together?

113
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,890
We are together, of course.

114
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:08,190
But if you discuss it with me, we can get everything done in one step.

115
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,910
Director Luo, we are all subordinates of Director Yuan.

116
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,980
We all listen to her.

117
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,660
- Tian Siyu? 
 - Yuan-Yuan Huizhong.

118
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:33,220
Ah, Yuan Huizhong. Right, right.

119
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:36,100
Please. Please come to my office.

120
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,300
This way.

121
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:03,290
Why didn't you expose her?

122
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:07,320
If we fought with our own people in front of the client, it won't do Lubao any good.

123
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:12,060
What do we do now? It's a ¥5,000,000 order.

124
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,630
What exactly is the deal with this client?

125
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:19,850
When I was an intern with Sister Yuan, my friend introduced me to Director Luo.

126
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:23,880
But Sister Yuan said I was short of experience at that time, so she asked Liu Jie to guide me.

127
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:28,310
Liu Jie and I spoke with Director Luo a few times but she said he didn't seem sincere so she gave up on it.

128
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:33,100
Later on, I was transferred to your team, then Director Luo contacted me.

129
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:36,680
This time, the meetings went quite smoothly. We were just preparing to sign the contract.

130
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,650
Liu Jie heard about something and she came as well.

131
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:44,460
When the client was put on records in the company, is it your name or Liu Jie's name?

132
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:48,540
I'm not sure. I was very new to the company at that time. I knew nothing.

133
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:53,400
When Liu Jie gave up this client, did she go to cancel the record?

134
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:57,090
I don't know.

135
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,690
Let's head back first.

136
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,210
Hi, where are the medicines for colds?

137
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,420
The ones for coughing are also here?

138
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,850
- Young man, you caught a cold? 
 - Yes.

139
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:21,330
Let me take your pulse and diagnose you.

140
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:24,730
There's no need. It's not that serious. I just need some medicine.

141
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:28,280
How about this? If you think what I say is right,

142
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,290
then you listen. If you think it's not right, then don't listen to it. Okay?

143
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:35,040
You have time anyway. Come on.

144
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,990
Your pulse is floating and tense.

145
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:01,280
Your cold is most likely caused by external chills.

146
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:05,990
It was probably because I got wet in the rain the other day.

147
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,280
Based on your health condition, rain

148
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,000
shouldn't cause such a serious cold.

149
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,880
The cold is just a superficial symptom.

150
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:19,150
The left guan and chi are not smooth. 
 (T/N: guan and chi are two of three areas used to feel the pulse in order to diagnose illnesses in Chinese medicine)

151
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:22,710
and the right-hand pulse is tight and rigid.

152
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:27,550
The inner cause should be depression and anxiety.

153
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,590
Then, what medicine should I take?

154
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:33,950
There are many medicines for cold.

155
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:38,070
As for depression and anxiety,

156
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:42,960
if you can't let it go yourself right now, taking medicine will be useless.

157
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,700
Let go of what?

158
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:51,330
Let go of what you bear in your mind constantly.

159
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:56,610
According to traditional Chinese medicine, all illnesses

160
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:59,010
are all basically psychological illnesses.

161
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:04,800
The psychological illnesses of modern-day people are usually connected to six words:

162
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,350
"Cannot be obtained. Afraid of loss."

163
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:13,000
The "let it go" you said means

164
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,240
to not work hard anymore. If you cannot obtain it, then don't obtain it.

165
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:20,800
If you are afraid of loss, then just let it leave.

166
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:27,180
What I mean is, you must be aware of your real situation.

167
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,620
Ginseng and pilose antler are both good things.

168
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:33,020
Many people become fresh with energy after they take them.

169
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:35,500
But if it's you have poor health,

170
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,430
then eating them will harm your body.

171
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:41,790
Let me prescribe you a medicinal recipe.

172
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:47,450
Thank you, Doctor. I'm okay. If it is indeed like what you said,

173
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:51,230
and I can recover by letting go, then I will try it.

174
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:54,960
No worries. I will still pay your consulting fee.

175
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,980
Thank you.

176
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:13,390
Liu Jie didn't cancel it.

177
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:15,050
She didn't.

178
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:17,170
Then, how do we count it?

179
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:23,180
Hello?

180
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:27,210
Li Siyu, President Pan asked you and Lin Ling to go to his office.

181
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,900
All right, I got it.

182
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,920
Let's go to GM Pan's office.

183
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,580
GM Pan. VP Fang.

184
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:51,080
Li Siyu, what happened today?

185
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:57,310
Meiyi Group?

186
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:59,460
What else can it be?

187
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,110
It was Lin Ling's client originally.

188
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:06,190
I checked. It was recorded with Liu Jie's name.

189
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:10,240
GM Pan. VP Fang. The company had stipulated

190
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,370
we report the client's name in advance. We aren't allowed to steal clients and lower prices in competition for clients.

191
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:17,960
But Li Siyu and Lin Ling completely didn't take the rules seriously.

192
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,230
I think it's a serious problem.

193
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:22,620
We can't allow these bad habits into the company.

194
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:25,570
Sister Yuan, you don't have to take it that far. Right?

195
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:28,940
Why not? The interest of the company should be above everything.

196
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:31,840
I'm saying that you don't have to take it as far as to confound what right with wrong,

197
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,730
and fight to tell on us first because of such a small order.

198
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:37,710
Li Siyu, who's the one "confounding what right with wrong"?

199
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:40,780
The company has the rule: the client belongs to the salesperson who reports it to the company.

200
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:45,090
It it not allowed to have cutthroat competition within the company. You encouraged your subordinate to close deals by any kind of means to reach the target!

201
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:47,150
- Who used any kind of means? 
 - You!

202
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,760
Enough.

203
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,490
This is not a supermarket.

204
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:57,180
We talk about work. We talk about facts and key points.

205
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,700
The first person in contact with Meiyi Group was Lin Ling.

206
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,270
The person who ended up confirming the order was Lin Ling.

207
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:06,880
Lin Ling has all the Wechat records of the whole process.

208
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:14,590
President Pan, I was the first person in contact with Meiyi Group.

209
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:17,500
Also, Director Luo is an old friend of mine.

210
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:21,220
Please. He doesn't know you at all. He met you for the first time today.

211
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,580
I know the situation.

212
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:25,890
I also know this Director Luo. Huizhong introduced him to our company at the beginning.

213
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:27,820
It's been about 10 years.

214
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,590
Oh, that's how it is.

215
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,380
President Pan,

216
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,740
actually I already finished discussing the contract with Director Luo.

217
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:37,280
It's just that they had a problem internally,

218
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,350
thus we didn't sign the contract this whole time.

219
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:42,700
But I didn't expect that Lin Ling would get in between

220
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,450
and quote a lower price.

221
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:48,140
Luckily, Director Luo regards me as an old friend

222
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:51,660
so the order was signed at my price.

223
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,480
You signed the contract?

224
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,930
Yes. ¥5,000,000. The deposit will be paid tomorrow.

225
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:01,810
How much did you quote?

226
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:05,580
My final price is 2% more than Lin Ling's.

227
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:09,070
You even pretended to be the sales director today!

228
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:12,270
Lin Ling, let me tell you.

229
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:15,860
When I was a little manager, for the sake of the business,

230
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:18,110
I told others I was the vice president.

231
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:22,950
President Pan is the same. To get the respect of others, he will say he is the chairman of some association.

232
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:25,480
Isn't it normal?

233
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,340
President Pan, I think this is a very serious issue.

234
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,910
If everyone is like this, stealing clients, quoting randomly, and creating a mess at the company,

235
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,710
then we can't work here anymore.

236
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:35,740
Meiyi Group was my client!

237
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:39,610
- The facts are all here yet you still want to spout nonsense? 
 - I am not spouting nonsense.

238
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:43,220
I am not going to waste my breath on you! I have nothing else to say.

239
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:46,040
- I just hope GM Pan, you will give me justice. 
 - You are lying!

240
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,860
Shut up!

241
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:05,530
Meiyi Group is Team One's client.

242
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:10,380
This order and the ¥5,000,000 in performance belongs to Team One.

243
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:16,470
In addition, Lin Ling violated the company's regulation. She will be fined ¥5,000.

244
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:19,820
Li Siyu, as her supervisor,

245
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,260
careless about monitoring the work of a subordinate. She will be fine ¥10,000.

246
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:25,570
Notify the whole company of the punishment.

247
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:38,950
Sister Siyu. Sister Siyu. Sister Si—

248
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:42,960
- You knew it was Liu Jie's client. Why did you go to contact them? 
 - I didn't know.

249
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,600
You should have known this!

250
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,390
Now that you've lost the client, the order, and was slapped in the face, how does it feel?

251
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:50,530
I'm wrong, Sister Siyu.

252
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:39,160
Siyu, after work, come over here earlier.

253
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,390
What's up?

254
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:43,110
I cooked a table full of good dishes.

255
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,430
You found a job?

256
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:46,590
No!

257
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,310
Then, why are you so excited?

258
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:50,710
Can't I get excited even though I don't have a job?

259
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:54,690
I saw an old Chinese medicine doctor today.

260
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:57,800
Chinese medicine? What's wrong?

261
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,100
I caught a cold because I got wet in the rain a couple of days ago.

262
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:03,490
I went out to buy some medicine. I bumped into him.

263
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,980
Are you interested in hearing about it?

264
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,830
Yes.

265
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:15,490
The Chinese medicine said I was depressed

266
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:20,110
It's all because I was thinking too much. I didn't learn to let it go.

267
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,210
Are you listening?

268
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:29,520
I'm listening.

269
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,850
So that's why I'm planning on not caring about anything.

270
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:37,790
I will take good care of myself. Even though I'm unemployed,

271
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:40,300
I have a healthy body at least.

272
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:51,560
What's wrong, Siyu?

273
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,480
I feel like your mood is off.

274
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,570
It's nothing. I have just been following up on orders.

275
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:02,700
Siyu, are the sales performances that important to you?

276
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:07,930
The sales performance decides if I can get the position of Sales Director or not next month.

277
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:11,470
So what if you get the position? So what if you don't get the position?

278
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:16,300
Since I've joined the competition, I need to work hard and get it.

279
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,900
This is probably what makes us troubled all the time.

280
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:25,210
We want to obtain yet we are afraid of loss.

281
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,020
What are you talking about?

282
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:29,520
The old Chinese medicine doctor told me this.

283
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,280
He said "cannot obtain" and "afraid of loss."

284
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:36,110
What?

285
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:39,340
After being unemployed, haven't I been sending resumes,

286
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:42,470
interviewing, sending resumes, interviewing, sending resumes...?

287
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:44,540
Haven't I been failing?

288
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:46,500
Failure is temporary.

289
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:50,750
I asked many friends. They all said that right now it is the offseason of job recruiting.

290
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,970
So don't doubt yourself.

291
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:57,430
I believe you will receive good news in the end as long as you persist.

292
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,270
Siyu,

293
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:06,680
I plan to stop applying to jobs for a while.

294
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:14,930
Yiming, are you overthinking too much?

295
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:18,980
I think I ran too fast before.

296
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,550
I thought too little.

297
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:26,220
It's not right to think too little. But you can't not run fast.

298
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:29,490
Even if you can't get it in the end, you have made efforts for it at least.

299
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:32,590
Worse comes to worst, you can start over after failing.

300
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:37,340
If you are always overcautious and indecisive, then you can achieve nothing in the end.

301
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:39,770
You have never failed before.

302
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:44,830
Siyu, starting over is really not that easy.

303
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:51,340
I said, I just lost a round.

304
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,980
Are you still coming tonight?

305
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,370
I will probably be late.

306
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,090
Do you still have work?

307
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:02,730
I have to go out.

308
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:04,600
Where to?

309
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,500
To see a client.

310
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:09,920
To get back the ¥5,000,000 which I lost.

311
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:41,400
 [Esteemed Gu Xiaoling, your debt has been settled in its entirety. Thank you for your cooperation.] 

312
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 Li Siyu, even though you say some foul things, I still have to thank you. 

313
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,800
 [Your message was sent, but it was rejected by the receiver.] 

314
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,400
 [Classy dresses] 

315
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,000
 Yuwei's mother, you can't dress so casually when the time comes. 

316
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,200
 Okay... I...

317
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,000
 That's right, Yuwei's mother. You need to wear some classier clothes. 

318
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,800
 Also, the shoes and your bag...

319
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:46,000
 You need to change those. Otherwise, it will be a disgrace. 

320
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,800
Everyone, we'll gather at the dessert shop on Wednesday evening at 7:30,

321
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,000
 to discuss about our joint letter to the school. 

322
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,100
 I hope all parents will understand the importance of this and attend.

323
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:43,200
Please excuse me. I have to attend to something tomorrow evening.

324
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,400
Got it.

325
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,600
 [Are you sure you want to delete these two from your cart?] 

326
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,600
 [Delete] 

327
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,000
You're back?

328
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:25,440
- Are Mom and Yuwei already asleep? 
 - Yes.

329
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,800
Why are you coming home later and later every day?

330
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,000
In the future, I'll be coming home even later.

331
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Why?

332
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,800
Old We wants to be the team leader as well. He's creating traps for me to fall into.

333
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,600
If I don't want to be put in a bad position,

334
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:52,000
I can only do everything my self.

335
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,800
Is he that evil?

336
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,800
There are too many people like that in the workplace.

337
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,600
True. Since Sister Siyu

338
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:04,600
began competing for sales director, she's constantly being messed with.

339
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:08,200
Early this morning, President Pan called her to his office to penalize her.

340
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,800
Now you understand how difficult it is to work in these positions, right?

341
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,800
So, from now on, don't go out so much.

342
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,200
Stay and take care of things at home, so I don't get distracted.

343
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,400
I go all out for Yuwei's sake.

344
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,800
Everyone says that in today's society,

345
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:25,000
it's all about resources and connections.

346
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,300
I work so hard to maintain my connections with those mothers...

347
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,200
aren't I doing that for our Yuwei?

348
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,600
In the future, she'll be able to operate on a higher platform.

349
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:38,400
But the problem is... isn't this too early to think about all that?

350
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,200
It's is not too early at all.

351
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,800
We're not starting from the same place as them.

352
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:46,600
We have to start our efforts in the locker room.

353
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,800
Then, according to what you're saying, people like me who come from the countryside,

354
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,400
don't even have the qualifications to get into the locker room.

355
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,600
But did I still get out?

356
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,200
That was before.

357
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,200
You students from poor and humble families still have opportunities.

358
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,800
It's not the same now.

359
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:04,400
I have to get Yuwei into those elite circles while she's young.

360
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:08,000
Then in the future when she grows up, she can become an elite.

361
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,500
By the way, there's a parents meeting tomorrow.

362
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,400
They say they want to write a joint letter to the school.

363
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,400
So, mothers and fathers all have to get together.

364
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,400
I just told you.

365
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:22,600
The office competition has entered a red-hot phase right now.

366
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,450
Even working overtime isn't enough.

367
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:27,200
Where would I find the time to go play those games of yours?

368
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,000
How can you say they're games?

369
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
This concerns the direction Yuwei will take in the future.

370
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:40,000
Zhizhi, you and I are not part of the elite.

371
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,600
You are trying so hard to squeeze into that circle. Don't you think it's too tiring?

372
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,700
Even if it is tiring, I am the one tired.

373
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:49,000
Can't we just take things as they come?

374
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,100
Isn't it great to just live our own life?

375
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:56,000
Are you hungry? I'll go make you a bowl of dumplings.

376
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,800
- I'm not hungry. 
 - They'll be ready soon.

377
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,900
Let's eat lunch together?

378
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,800
If Li Siyu will be there, I won't go.

379
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,400
 Just the two of us. 

380
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,000
Okay, then.

381
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,700
 [Zhang Zhizhi] 

382
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,000
Zhizhi.

383
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,500
 Sister Siyu, you're not at the company? 

384
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:28,000
I'm going to solicit an order. I'm on my way back now.

385
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,200
 How did it go? 

386
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,900
¥500,000. Too little.

387
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,420
Hey, Sister Siyu.

388
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,400
I discovered a great little restaurant.

389
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:42,000
Let's try it out for lunch. It might change your mood.

390
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,200
 Let's go. 

391
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,300
It'll be my treat.

392
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:55,600
Between the two of us, does it matter who treats who?

393
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:01,400
Gu Xiaoling won't be there, will she?

394
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,400
Do you want ask her to come?

395
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,000
No. Just the two of us.

396
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,800
Okay. I'll book the table right away.

397
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:38,040
- Miss Zhang's reservation. 
 - This way please.

398
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:45,830
You two got here before me.

399
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,880
I still have something to do, I'm leaving.

400
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,540
You still have to eat first.

401
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:51,260
I also have things to do.

402
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:54,120
Xiaoling...

403
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,940
Sit, sit... Please sit down.

404
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:04,280
Zhizhi, do you not know that I already cut ties with her?

405
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,340
I know.

406
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:09,530
However, don't you guys cut ties multiple times a year?

407
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:12,770
Also, you guys never cut ties for more than a week,

408
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:16,470
so I guess it's almost time to end this.

409
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:18,380
So I invited you two here.

410
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:21,370
There's no way I'm going to reconcile with her this time.

411
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:27,380
You said that last time you had a falling out.

412
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:34,810
Last year when you guy had a falling out, you two also said that.

413
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:39,440
And three years ago, you said a similar thing.

414
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:49,070
You two are both over thirty,

415
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:51,020
how are you still acting like children?

416
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:53,290
You cut ties for every little thing.

417
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:55,860
Even Yuwei doesn't act the way you do.

418
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,840
She blocked me first!

419
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,310
Yes, she blocked you first. But before she blocked you,

420
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:03,740
she transferred you ¥110,000.

421
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:13,600
Sister Siyu, last time when you were framed in the company and were in a bad mood,

422
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,570
we all could not contact you,

423
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:18,440
you don't even know how worried she was.

424
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,350
I'm going to the bathroom. I'm telling you...

425
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:32,720
If I come back and either one of you has disappeared,

426
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,860
then I'll be angry.

427
00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:01,510
No matter what, thank you anyway, for taking care of my urgent need.

428
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:05,530
I have been always taking care of your urgent needs these past few years.

429
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:07,850
But you've never appreciated it.

430
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:10,350
I have also helped you quite a bit.

431
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:12,260
When dad found out that you wrote a love letter to a boy before

432
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:15,740
the college entrance examination, I was the one who took the blame for you.

433
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:18,330
You wouldn't even pass the graduation exam without my help.

434
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:21,450
When you first came to Shanghai and had no money, I was the one who sent you money.

435
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:24,510
When you had no place to live in Shanghai, it was me who gave you half of my bed.

436
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:27,570
Every time you argued with Chen Yiming, when did I ever not help you?

437
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:29,800
How have you guys started arguing again?

438
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,620
Zhizhi, tell us, did I help her more or did she help me more?

439
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:35,520
Did you take note of it all? Come on, take out your little notebook.

440
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,720
We can see who owes who with one look.

441
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,280
You two have known each other since you were 12,

442
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:43,310
you've been sisters for over 10 years.

443
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:46,430
Isn't helping each other a given?

444
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:52,670
All you guys think about is how much you've helped the other,

445
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:55,280
but can't you guys think about each other's good traits?

446
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:03,740
To me, even though you have different personalities,

447
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:07,110
you two are generous, loyal sisters.

448
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:11,990
Seeing you two like this, I really am about to take back my admiration for you two.

449
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:18,490
I admit...

450
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:20,640
in these past years...

451
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,870
she may have helped me more.

452
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:28,930
In these years, with her being noisy and messing around,

453
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:30,690
I'm not lonely anymore.

454
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:35,010
I know.

455
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:40,020
You two want to take a bit out of each other often,

456
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:44,020
but isn't the scolding towards each other for the good of the other?

457
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:47,130
This way when an outsider hurts one of you,

458
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:49,500
both of you would not care about anything else but to protect the other.

459
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:58,420
My attitude that day wasn't great,

460
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,590
I'm sorry.

461
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:03,260
You don't have to say sorry.

462
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,300
I need to thank you.

463
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:15,510
I'm going to go to the bathroom again.

464
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:27,570
Between these two areas, add another two to three light positions.

465
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:28,970
Okay.

466
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:35,670
Are you tired? There's a place to sit over there. We can rest for a minute.

467
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,530
Okay, let's go.

468
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:41,750
- Sit down. 
 - Okay.

469
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,610
Thank you, Mr. Liu.

470
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:56,260
You've worked hard.

471
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:58,760
No, it's not hard at all.

472
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:04,620
Let me see how much we've walked since we've left today.

473
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:09,020
We've walked over 20,000 steps.

474
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,170
That's nothing.

475
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:15,130
When I was in school, I used to walk 20 kilometers back and forth

476
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:18,450
- on mountain roads. 
 - Are you from a countryside village?

477
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:20,740
Yes.

478
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:24,700
I am too.

479
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:30,110
Mr. Liu, we were actually schoolmates.

480
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:32,290
Really?

481
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:35,660
It's not easy to be admitted to SJTU.

482
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,120
I was the top scorer in my class.

483
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,260
So was I.

484
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,160
I know.

485
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,880
It wasn't easy for either of us.

486
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:59,670
Mr. Liu, can I call you Senior Brother?

487
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,430
Of course, you can.

488
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:07,250
Senior Brother...

489
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:10,820
Are you used to living in the city now?

490
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:15,280
I'm used to some aspects, but there are some aspects that I'm still not used to.

491
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,020
Such as?

492
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,360
Not speaking of other things, let's talk about food.

493
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,590
No matter how much I eat, I can't taste the flavors of home.

494
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:25,440
Exactly. I have that feeling as well.

495
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,610
I remember when I was younger and got hungry,

496
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:29,460
I would go dig up some potatoes.

497
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:31,450
Then threw it in the woodstove.

498
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:34,620
It would be ready for a meal if cooked. Then take it out.

499
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:36,290
Peel the skin and dip it in soy sauce.

500
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:38,450
Or chilly powder.

501
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:41,200
- You ate it like that, too? 
 - Of course!

502
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,970
That taste and that texture

503
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:46,210
is so great.

504
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,120
Such a pity. Nowadays, the imported potatoes

505
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,690
don't taste like before.

506
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:09,460
By the way, Yayun. I thought of

507
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:12,320
a good way to find the "nail"

508
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:14,650
but  I need your cooperation.

509
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:17,270
Okay, I will help you.

510
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:31,330
Zhizhi, do you have diarrhea?

511
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:33,850
You went to toilet so many times.

512
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,740
Liu Yang's mom is here.

513
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,320
Auntie is here?

514
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:44,080
To help you look after Yuwei?

515
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:51,450
Also, to urge Liu Yang and me to have a son.

516
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:55,290
Every morning and evening, I must drink

517
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:58,330
two bowls of Chinese medicine made for having a son.

518
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:01,110
It has caused me to have diarrhea.

519
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:04,610
What era is it!? She is forcing you to have a son?

520
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:06,360
This is too unreasonable.

521
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:10,870
She just feels that since every family in her village has

522
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:14,220
a son, so our family must also have one.

523
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:18,950
You can't give birth to one. This is... This is outrageous.

524
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:21,110
What age is it? That is way too strange.

525
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:23,590
If you didn't tell me, then I wouldn't believe it.

526
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:29,110
Yes, Aunty is... is a bit...

527
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:34,120
Shit. It's over ¥3,000.

528
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:40,200
- Over ¥3,000? 
 - Yes.

529
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,660
- I can't tell. 
 - You sell batteries,

530
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:45,350
it will be weird if you know the price of clothes.

531
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:53,080
- Xiaoling, can you help me with something? 
 - Tell me.

532
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:56,550
Yuwei's class is holding a party.

533
00:41:57,620 --> 00:42:01,600
The other moms attending usually dress really well.

534
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:05,690
You also know that, I usually wear... these clothes.

535
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:11,120
No need to say more. Come to my house this weekend. Clothes, bags, shoes; you can choose whatever you want.

536
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,630
Thank you.

537
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:18,240
I'll toast to you two good sisters.

538
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,890
With you two by my side, all problems are no longer a problem.

539
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:25,220
We would also like to thank you for having us reconcile with each other.

540
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:26,700
Thank you.

541
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:40,470
Sister Siyu, can you come over for dinner tonight? Help me talk to Liu Yang's mom.

542
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:42,030
No problem.

543
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:46,130
I know that you are busy so I don't even know how to ask you

544
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:51,020
but I really can't get through Liu Yang's mom's stubbornness.

545
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:54,280
It's no problem. I haven't been to your house for a long time anyways.

546
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:59,450
Sort these out. Thank you.

547
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:02,150
- Sister Yuan, heave a seat for now. 
 - Okay.

548
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:06,100
How is it?

549
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:09,610
Don't worry, Sister Yuan. You are still ahead.

550
00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:11,410
By how much?

551
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:13,900
¥1,130,000.

552
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:17,320
Only ¥1,130,000? Did I just got a ¥5,000,000 order?

553
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:19,240
Correct. Plus that ¥ 5,000,000 order,

554
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,940
you are ahead by ¥1,130,000.
