[To Dear Myself]

3
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,200
[Episode 39]

4
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm tired. I want to rest.

5
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,800
Xiaoling.

6
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,000
Xiaoling!

7
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,400
What are you doing?

8
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,200
If you don't tell me today, then you cannot leave.

9
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,200
I don't want to talk to someone who is drunk!

10
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,800
Xiaoling, there are some things that I can't say unless I'm drunk.

11
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,600
Gu Xiaoling! I love you, Gu Xiaoling.

12
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,000
Can you get together with me?

13
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,800
Let me go!

14
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,800
But I do not love you!

15
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,200
I know.

16
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,400
I know that you don't love me.

17
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,800
You don't love me.

18
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,300
In your heart, there was never a place for me.

19
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,100
There wasn't in the past, and there isn't one now.

20
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,800
In the future, there won't be either.

21
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,600
Haowen,

22
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,000
I've always regarded you as one of my most important friends.

23
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,600
If I had any problems,

24
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:03,000
I wouldn't tell my boyfriend, but I would tell them all to you.

25
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,300
In my heart, you're not someone who doesn't matter,

26
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:16,610
but you've always known what type of man I've wanted to get married to.

27
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:22,340
This He Mu is the person I am determined to marry.

28
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,570
Come in.

29
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,600
- Manager Fang. 
 - What's going on?

30
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,600
The work proposal for next year.

31
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,700
You finished it so quickly?

32
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,000
[Work Proposal]

33
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,400
I took a look at the department's work proposals from the past few years and made a few adjustments.

34
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:22,000
The goal for next year is to increase the revenue made from the scenic area by 5%.

35
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,240
That's pretty good. You've worked hard.

36
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,400
And this is... what?

37
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,400
After looking at travel agencies, online and offline promotional channels,

38
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:37,300
I made another completely new work proposal.

39
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,800
You made two?

40
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,900
If we re-consolidate our marketing,

41
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm sure that the revenue next year will increase by at least 80%.

42
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,400
You want everyone in our department to open channels?

43
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,100
That is my suggestion.

44
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,600
Everyone is in charge of one sector?

45
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,300
That is my suggestion.

46
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,100
Also, have nighttime events?

47
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,700
That's my suggestion.

48
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,600
Xiao Ding, inform everyone that we will be having a meeting this afternoon.

49
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,600
We will be discussing Li Siyu's work proposal for next year.

50
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,800
Yes, everyone.

51
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,100
- Then I'll go make a few more copies. 
 - No, no, no.

52
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:27,800
Let's just make copies of this one.

53
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,800
This one is the old one.

54
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,100
We're going to discuss this one.

55
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,700
Why?

56
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,600
According to the company's plan for future developments,

57
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,300
we must consider market equilibrium as we are growing.

58
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:45,000
We must consider the five-year plan and the ten-year plan,

59
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
We also need to think about the benefits

60
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,400
of the employees and the company.

61
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,600
We also need to consider how to invoke employees' enthusiasm and motivation.

62
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,800
So, in consideration of the consistency of our work,

63
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,200
we should just discuss this one.

64
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,400
Siyu, you are very passionate,

65
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,500
but you're not mature enough.

66
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:13,220
Then, why did you have me make a useless proposal?

67
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,000
To get you to mature more quickly.

68
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,700
Hurry and go make copies.

69
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,600
You...

70
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,400
Li Siyu!

71
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,800
I will...

72
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,000
Siyu, why did you come back so early?

73
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,200
Are you okay?

74
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,700
I'm fine.

75
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:21,600
Siyu, let's go. Come fishing with me.

76
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,400
I don't want to go.

77
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,600
You must go.

78
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,200
Just go.

79
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,400
Dad, wait for me.

80
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,900
Okay.

81
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,600
Be careful.

82
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,400
You felt wronged at work, right?

83
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,600
No.

84
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,000
That workplace of ours... I know how it is.

85
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,600
Then, how come you stayed there all your life?

86
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,400
It was suitable for me.

87
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,600
With your personality, you don't fit there.

88
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,000
You definitely can't stand it there.

89
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,200
I offended Manager Feng.

90
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,000
Child,

91
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,100
you are not like me at all. You're just like your mother.

92
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,000
When I was young, I was pretty afraid of my mom.

93
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I was also afraid.

94
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,300
I didn't want to be like her at all.

95
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,300
But at your core,

96
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:43,200
you are more like her than I am.

97
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,000
You are ambitious and don't accept defeat.

98
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You are bellicose and serious.

99
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:52,990
Honestly, I came back this time

100
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,400
because I didn't want to be that version of myself.

101
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,860
That's not up to you.

102
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,800
The personality a person is born with

103
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,600
cannot be changed.

104
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,600
When you were young,

105
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,200
you placed third place for a test in the math olympiad once.

106
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,600
Your mother hit you and punished you by not letting you eat.

107
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,600
My heart ached for you,

108
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,000
so I secretly took you out for noodles.

109
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,800
I told you that from then on, you won't need to study for the math olympiad anymore.

110
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,300
Hey! You rejected me right then!

111
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,400
On one hand, you were saying that your mother is cruel,

112
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,000
but on the other, you were swearing to me

113
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,400
that "next time, I will definitely get first place!"

114
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,100
This situation...

115
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,400
A child like you,

116
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,400
may be beaten until blood drips from your head

117
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,300
and is definitely in pain;

118
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,400
however, if you are not allowed to go onto the battlefield,

119
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:54,100
to go fight and work hard, you'll feel even more pain.

120
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,800
Your point is that

121
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,400
I should still try my best to strive for what I want?

122
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,300
I didn't say you should do anything.

123
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:12,300
I'm just telling you what kind of environment your personality is suited for.

124
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:23,400
Go back. Go back to Shanghai.

125
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:28,370
I can strive for what I want here as well.

126
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,700
A few days ago, I just treated Old Zhai to dinner.

127
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:36,200
In the next few days, it looks like I'm going to have to treat Old Fang to dinner.

128
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:41,200
You... With your bellicose, serious personality,

129
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,200
if you stay for a few more days,

130
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,000
the good character and the likability that I've spent my life building

131
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,200
will all be ruined by you.

132
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,600
Dad!

133
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:55,200
In such a tiny place,

134
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,600
I meet acquaintances everywhere I go.

135
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,600
If you offend someone and your auntie and I go out,

136
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,400
we will be too ashamed to greet them if we see them on the street.

137
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,200
In Shanghai, it's different. Shanghai is huge.

138
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,800
If you offend someone,

139
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,800
and you can't stay in Xuhui District, then you can go to Jingan District.

140
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,300
If you can't stay in Jingan District, then go to Huangpu District.

141
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,800
Pudong District! You won't have to see them for the rest of your life!

142
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,300
But I want to spend more time with you.

143
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,400
If you could change your personality

144
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,600
and stop hitting or killing,

145
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,200
like me,

146
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,200
talking happily with anyone while keeping me company,

147
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,600
then, of course, I'd be happy.

148
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:44,070
But you cannot change.

149
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:50,180
You're sulking and unhappy every day.

150
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,670
I feel bad for you.

151
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,400
Let m-m-me make it clear.

152
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,800
I'm not trying to drive you away.

153
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,400
I just hope that you can find

154
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,600
a place to live that is more suitable for your personality.

155
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,200
That way, you will be happy!

156
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,400
Thank you, Dad. I understand.

157
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,400
I have goosebumps now.

158
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,000
Why are you being polite with me?

159
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,700
Dad,

160
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,400
I want to ask you a question.

161
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,100
Go ahead.

162
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,200
Did you ever love my mom?

163
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,600
Your mom was so outstanding,

164
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,500
who wouldn't love her?

165
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,000
Then how come after my mom died,

166
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,300
you got re-married in a matter of months?

167
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,600
After your mom died,

168
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,600
you were only 12 years old.

169
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,200
It's the time when you needed to be taken care of the most.

170
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,900
The age where you needed the most guidance.

171
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:44,400
At the time, I really didn't know how I was supposed to teach you.

172
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:49,260
It just so happen that someone introduced your auntie to me.

173
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,400
I remember the first time we met,

174
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,400
she asked me

175
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,600
what kind of flavors you liked.

176
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,800
Later, she made you lots of food for me to bring to you.

177
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,000
At the time, I was certain

178
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:14,300
that this woman would surely treat you well.

179
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,800
So, it was for me?

180
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,200
That's not completely it. It was also for me, too.

181
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:30,200
Your auntie happens to be the exact opposite of your mom.

182
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,900
She had absolutely no expectations for me.

183
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,650
Siyu.

184
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,030
I love your mom.

185
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,400
But to tell you the truth,

186
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:54,860
your auntie is more suitable for me.

187
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,500
Dad,

188
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,600
you actually understand everything.

189
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,400
I'm not stupid.

190
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,400
I'm just satisfied with what I have.

191
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:20,860
Honestly,

192
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,520
I've never forgotten about your mother,

193
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:30,350
but life must go on.

194
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,300
We're back!

195
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,400
We're back!

196
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,800
How was the harvest?

197
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,400
Tonight, we're eating fish! Eating fish! Eating fish!

198
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,400
That's great!

199
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,800
- We didn't catch a single fish. 
 - This child.

200
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,900
You annoying old man.

201
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,200
Siyu, your Uncle Zhou called. He said if you were not happy at the marketing department,

202
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,800
then he can switch you to a different department.

203
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,600
There's no need, Auntie. I'm planning to go back to Shanghai.

204
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,400
Go back to Shanghai?

205
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,200
Don't look at me, it wasn't my idea. It was her own decision.

206
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,200
Here, here. Give this to me.

207
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,800
Is it because of Xiao Tang?

208
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,000
No. I just want to go back.

209
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
What's wrong with home?

210
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,800
Home is perfect in every way.

211
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:39,400
However, I can really put my skill to good use in Shanghai.

212
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,800
You said that you wouldn't leave.

213
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,300
I did.

214
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:46,800
At the time, I also thought I wouldn't leave;

215
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:51,200
but now, I finally know who I am,

216
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,800
what I want, and what places suit me better.

217
00:17:54,800 --> 00:18:00,000
Just let her go. You won't be able to make her stay.

218
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,600
I understand, but...

219
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,800
Auntie,

220
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:11,600
thank you for taking care of me and my dad all these years.

221
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,700
What kind of words are those?

222
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,600
After I go back and work for a few more years,

223
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,200
and save enough money to buy a big house,

224
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,800
I'll bring you and my dad to Shanghai with me.

225
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,200
Then, you'll be able to see me and Xiaoling every day.

226
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,200
Okay.

227
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,100
Mom.

228
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,700
Mom!

229
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,300
Daughter.

230
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,500
Yes.

231
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,900
Dad.

232
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,300
Tomorrow, I will go back.

233
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,600
Okay.

234
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,000
Child,

235
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:36,000
if your mother was here, she'd definitely say

236
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,100
that you should go strive for what you want.

237
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,600
But I must say, you shouldn't care too much about success and failure,

238
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,800
winning and losing, and results.

239
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:51,600
Also, don't care too much about how much money you make or how big your house is.

240
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:56,800
Happiness is the most important thing.

241
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,600
Enjoy the process of striving for what you want.

242
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,400
Experience the joys of it.

243
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:09,600
That's the most, most important part.

244
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,500
I understand.

245
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,800
Come on.

246
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,200
Zhizhi, wait a second.

247
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,400
Niu Niu!

248
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,800
Niu Niu's mom, please help me look after her for a moment!

249
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,400
This is for you.

250
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,600
What is this?

251
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,600
When you open it, you'll know.

252
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,800
- Okay. 
 - I'm leaving now.

253
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,600
Be safe!

254
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,200
- Hello? 
 - Hi.

255
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,000
You never officially replied to the proposal I made to you,

256
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,800
and I'm afraid that you would think that I wasn't being serious,

257
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:21,400
so I bought this gift for you.

258
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,200
Are you proposing to me?

259
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,700
Yes.

260
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,300
Zhizhi,

261
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,800
please marry me.

262
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:34,000
Be my wife. Be Sushan's mother.

263
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,200
Let me think about it.

264
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,800
Okay. I will wait.

265
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,400
Okay.

266
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:59,490
You're back?

267
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,000
Yuwei!

268
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:46,110
It’s daddy and mommy!

269
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:48,870
Zhizhi, sorry. 
 [This is the first picture of us together. That year, you were 21 and I was 25.] 

270
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:54,370
I remember the first time I met you, I felt you were especially pure and warm.

271
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:58,320
At that time, I thought that if I can spend the rest of my life with you,

272
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,210
I will definitely be very much at ease and happy.

273
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:05,300
My dream came true, we became wife and husband. 
 [Half a year later, we got married.]

274
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:10,700
I was too poor to hold a wedding ceremony then.

275
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:14,240
I couldn't even afford wedding photos with you.

276
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,520
But you didn't complain at all.

277
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:21,450
On the contrary, you told me that you were very happy and satisfied.

278
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:29,240
One year after that, you gave me the cutest daughter in the world. 
 [After Yuwei was born, our world of two became three.]

279
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:35,600
You gave me more new experiences. You made my life more complete.

280
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,920
Is that me?

281
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:48,820
However, I didn't cherish what I had.

282
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:53,710
I only saw my own busyness, ignoring your exhaustion.

283
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:58,860
I only felt my own stress but couldn't see your sacrifice.

284
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:01,090
Finally,

285
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:04,850
I made a huge mistake one day.

286
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:08,680
I didn't realize until the day I lost everything,

287
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,650
of what kind of happiness I had before.

288
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:18,420
Zhizhi,

289
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:21,570
I don't dare to ask for your forgiveness.

290
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:23,610
I only hope 

291
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,780
that I can have a chance

292
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:31,090
to make up for what for my negligence towards you and the hurt I've caused you before.

293
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:36,260
I also don't dare to have wild hopes of us returning to the way we were before, 

294
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:40,980
but I do hope that I can put double the effort into

295
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:44,200
giving you a future full of sunshine.

296
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:48,970
♫  Your voice is light and soft  ♫

297
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:53,680
♫  Forms the love I want  ♫

298
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,780
♫  Your eyes are innocent and clear  ♫

299
00:24:56,780 --> 00:25:01,670
♫  like the ripples in the middle of a lake  ♫

300
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:05,720
♫  The world suddenly became quiet  ♫

301
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:09,620
Daddy! 
 ♫  As if someone pressed pause  ♫

302
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:17,040
♫  How much luck did I exchange in order to meet you  ♫

303
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:21,400
♫  In this lifetime, I just want to tightly hold your hand  ♫

304
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,740
♫  As we slowly walk and slowly feel  ♫

305
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,410
Zhizhi,

306
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,620
although we met

307
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:31,400
a very long time ago,

308
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:35,500
it is only today

309
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:41,010
when I got to really know you and myself.

310
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:46,230
Zhizhi,

311
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,860
please marry me one more time.

312
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:03,760
Mommy, hurry and say yes! Hurry and say yes!

313
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:10,220
Liu Yang, stand up first. It's not good for Yuwei to see this.

314
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:17,400
Daddy and mommy, what's not good about this?

315
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:28,510
I just started working in my new position, so I'm very busy. I really don't have time to think about this.

316
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:36,160
You mean...

317
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,830
that you want me to...

318
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:41,980
give you a bit more time?

319
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:56,360
Then...

320
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,620
I'll leave this here for now.

321
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,660
Zhizhi,

322
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:37,750
no matter how long you need to think about this, it's okay.

323
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,530
I will wait for you.

324
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:45,620
No matter what decision you make,

325
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,310
I will accept it.

326
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,710
You guys rest early then.

327
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:10,990
Yuwei, I'm leaving now.

328
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:15,380
Bye, Daddy.

329
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:20,470
Listen to your mom.

330
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:49,850
Mommy, why didn't you say yes to daddy?

331
00:28:57,810 --> 00:29:00,120
I don't know either.

332
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:12,020
Two men proposed to you on the same day.

333
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:15,940
Zhizhi, your charm is explosive!

334
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:20,560
I've never experienced this before.

335
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,680
At the beginning,

336
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:28,860
I couldn't even breath. Dong, dong, dong. My heart was flustering so much.

337
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:31,180
Who are you going to choose?

338
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,470
What do you think?

339
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:39,810
Pick the person who gave the bigger diamond.

340
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:46,760
However, Liu Yang is Yuwei's dad so that is an added point.

341
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:50,210
But...

342
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:53,280
I don't want to choose either one.

343
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,070
Why?

344
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:58,900
I feel like my situation right now is pretty good.

345
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:03,780
Although work is tiring, I'm at peace.

346
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,720
I also don't want to change.

347
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:10,690
Then you need to return both these diamonds.

348
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:12,840
What a pity.

349
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:18,200
What is there to pity? In the future, when I earn enough money, I can buy one for myself.

350
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:23,290
It's all the same, a marriage proposal.

351
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:28,510
Why doesn't He Mu gift me a diamond?

352
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:30,610
What did he give you then?

353
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,340
A miraculous device that helps you sleep.

354
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:35,070
What?

355
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:41,590
This thing. Super good at making me fall asleep.

356
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:47,010
Every time I turn to page 5, I'm unconscious.

357
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:57,520
Xiaoling, do you really think he is the one?

358
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:03,770
He has what I want and I have what he wants.

359
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:05,870
We are a match made in Heaven.

[Shanghai Long Distance Northern Bus Station]

361
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:18,520
Aren't you picking me up? Where are you? Where's your car?

362
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,410
I suddenly had work to take care of.

363
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:22,660
You are so unreliable!

364
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:24,680
I called a DiDi for you. 
 (TN: DiDi is China's version of Uber/Lyft)

365
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:27,610

Hu W N 1400

367
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:38,880
I see it.

368
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,700
Older Sister, what a coincidence!

369
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,620
What a coincidence! Let me help you.

370
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:44,770
Gu Xiaoling.

371
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:46,770
You are addicted to betraying me, aren't you?

372
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:51,880
He gifted me a set of Lancome. I couldn't reject him.

373
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,340
Gu Xiaoling!

374
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,660
There is a surprise!

375
00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:02,220
You're a poor boy yet you bought a set of Lancome? Are you out of your mind?

376
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:06,250
Hey! That's the exact feeling! You haven't hit me for a long time.

377
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:09,020
I've been itching for it. Hit me some more.

378
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:18,240
You can't blame me. Why didn't you reply to my messages?

379
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,500
If you have that kind of money, why couldn't you buy some better clothes?

380
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:23,690
Why couldn't you buy a nice meal? Why couldn't you rent a bigger house?

381
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:29,370
Older Sister, why do you talk about money all the time? Aren't you a bit tacky?

382
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:33,490
If you have the time to spend on me, will it kill you to better yourself?

383
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:35,560
Will it kill you to go look for a better job?

384
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:38,280
But if there is no love, I'll die, Older Sister!

385
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:42,420
Find a girl your age! Wasting time and money on me, even if your heart doesn't ache, my heart aches for you.

386
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:45,310
I like challenging myself with someone like you.

387
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,940
Where are you taking me to?

388
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,890
We're almost there. We're almost there.

390
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:27,620
Why haven't you returned the car yet?

391
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:28,690
Where do I return it to?

392
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:30,810
The car rental company.

393
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:34,420
Older Sister, although you were born after 1985,

394
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:38,060
why do you nag like a person born after 1955?

395
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,300
Fuck off.

396
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,630
Guan Xiaotang, where on earth are you taking me to?

397
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:45,200
We're almost there. Be patient. It's just upstairs.

398
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:48,180
Let's go, let's go.

399
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:52,820
We're here.

400
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,700
Hello, President Guan.

401
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,300
Let me introduce you.

402
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,680
This is our company's Director Li.

403
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,290
Director Li.

404
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:01,820
This way.

405
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:04,710
What's going on? 
 [Siyu E-Commerce Company] 

406
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,190
Come here.

407
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:08,680
This way. Let's take a look over here first.

408
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:12,340
This is the tea room.

409
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:18,130
It took a very long time for me to choose the wallpaper. Lately, I've been spending all my time on the renovation.

410
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:23,400
The renovation for this company just finished a few days ago. I haven't hired a lot people yet.

411
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:28,760
I even haven't decided on the main business yet. I've been waiting for you to decide.

412
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,600
What are you up to?

413
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:36,220
Everyone, stop working for a moment. Let me  make an introduction. This is our company's Director Li.

414
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,440
 Hi, Director Li. 

415
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,160
This way.

416
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:45,000
Let's go. This way.

417
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:53,200
How is it? This is our office.

418
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,550
You can choose either table. Do you like it?

419
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:58,090
What exactly are you up to?

420
00:34:58,090 --> 00:35:02,120
Did you forget? I said that I would make a website for you.

421
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:10,380
Guan Xiaotang, where did you get this much money?

422
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,930
Did you borrow money from loan sharks?

423
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:15,500
I didn't. This was just the allowance my dad gave me.

424
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:20,480
Your dad collects junk, how much money could he possibly have?

425
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:24,880
The annual report he got last month says a few hundred million RMB.

426
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:27,030
RMB?

427
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:31,280
American dollars... he doesn't have the skills for that.

428
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:38,300
When you were eating dinner with my relatives, everything you said was true?

429
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,190
I've never lied to you before.

430
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:44,200
Didn't you pick up junk with your grandpa when you were little?

431
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,790
Yes. My mom

432
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:51,580
re-married so my dad left me at my grandpa's place when I was 2 years old.

433
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:53,870
I collected junk with my grandpa.

434
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:58,450
Didn't you say that your dad passed away from a car accident?

435
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:03,080
My dad did business for many years out there and didn't come home, so to me, it's like he passed.

436
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:06,660
When his business got bigger and he brought me to his side, I was already a teenager.

437
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:09,340
The transformer without the leg...

438
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:11,750
Yes. It was made by the pieces of junk I collected.

439
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:12,950
The car downstairs?

440
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:16,280
The present my dad gave to me for my eighteenth birthday.

441
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:19,640
Why did you come to work by bus then?

442
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,750
I like it.

443
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:23,470
Why did you live in your friend's place and freeload off them?

444
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:25,410
I like it.

445
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:35,680
Older Sister! Older Sister, are you mad?

446
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,760
Older Sister.

447
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,400
I don't like people lying to me.

448
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,390
I never lied to you.

449
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:43,970
You make me feel very stupid.

450
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,790
You especially cute when you do stupid things.

451
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:56,970
If you don't like this company, then tell me what you like. I can gift it to you.

452
00:36:56,970 --> 00:37:01,120
If I want something, then I will earn it myself.

453
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,700
I just want to give you a present to make you happy.

454
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:11,590
Do you know when I am the happiest? I'm happiest when I work hard for what I want.

455
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:14,890
I'm happiest when I insist and fight on despite repeated setbacks.

456
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:18,960
- I'm happiest when I win after going through all the difficulties. Do you understand? 
 - I understand!

457
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,190
- I like the feeling of surpassing others and overcoming myself. Do you understand?
 - I understand! I understand—

458
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:23,670
No, you don't!

459
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:28,730
A rich second generation heir like you who opens a company as if you are just buying a toy will never understand!

460
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:33,080
Older Sister, why are you going through menopause again?

461
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:39,790
Guan Xiaotang, this is not what I want.

462
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:45,630
Okay. I'm wrong in this. I love you. That's not wrong, is it?

463
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,860
We're not suitable for each other!

464
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,490
I think we are quite suitable for each other!

465
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:51,500
I'm so many years older than you!

466
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:54,290
If you were the same age as me, then I would feel that you are superficial and stupid!

467
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:56,760
But I feel like you are superficial and stupid right now!

468
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,020
I will grow up.

469
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:03,690
Perhaps.

470
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:07,450
But I don't have the confidence and patience to wait for you to grow up.

471
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:12,420
If I become mature as soon as possible, will you love me?

472
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:19,820
People mature after they get hurt again and again.

473
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:24,380
Xiaotang, I'm afraid you don't have a chance.

474
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:29,290
Don't you feel that I'm being hurt right now?

475
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:34,930
If this is called hurt, then you-you really are too young.

476
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:41,750
Li Siyu, don't look down on me!

477
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:49,690
Li Siyu, I will definitely let you see me become super ripe! 
 (T/N: ripe = mature) 

478
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:53,340
Wait! That day won't come too late!

479
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:56,290
It won't be long!

480
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:22,130
Why are you here?

481
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:25,080
I came to consult with Lubao's PR department.

482
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:28,590
They told me that you were also here so I came to see you.

483
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:31,230
How was it?

484
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:35,930
It was okay. But it was as you said.

485
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:40,180
Right now, Lubao's PR strategy is from ten years ago.

486
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:43,000
It's a bit out of touch with today's society.

487
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:49,210
Yiming, I will support you in whatever you do. What I want is the outcome.

488
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:52,550
But this isn't an easy job.

489
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:57,550
Otherwise, I won't have asked you for help so many times.

490
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:59,550
I definitely won't let you down.

491
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:01,350
Thank you.

492
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:03,840
I should thank you.

493
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,180
Why are you so polite?

494
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:10,210
Okay. I need to go back to the company. I'm leaving now.

495
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,720
What's wrong?

496
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:22,540
Nothing, I just want to take another look at you.

497
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:25,730
Enough. Stop being naughty.

498
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:28,330
I will leave now.

499
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,220
- Brother Yiming. 
 - Zhizhi.

500
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:55,000
What brings you here?

501
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,840
I came here for work.

502
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:03,320
How are you guys doing?

503
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:08,770
We're doing well. Well...

504
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:12,460
Nevermind.

505
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:18,250
Okay. That's good then. I'm leaving then.

507
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:40,640
Okay. Okay. See you. Bye.

508
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:44,930
Zhzihi, you lost some weight. But you look more energetic!

509
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:48,290
Really? Your complexion also looks better than before!

510
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:50,460
Look at me! Look at me! Look at me!

511
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:53,450
How is it? Do I look younger than before?

512
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:56,560
You are always the most young and beautiful one.

513
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:02,370
It's a pity that I have nothing else besides my beauty.

514
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:04,180
Here.

515
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:06,040
I don't drink sweet things.

516
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,240
Fussy.

517
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:13,940
Sister Siyu, I made plans with someone. I have to leave in a bit.

518
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:16,030
Okay.

519
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:20,220
Zhizhi, did you make plans with that Mr. Su?

520
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,820
Zhizhi, you have a boyfriend?

521
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:27,250
He doesn't really count as one.

522
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:29,910
He even proposed. How is he not?

523
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:32,100
I didn't agree to anything.

524
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:34,650
How is he?

525
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:36,530
He is a nice guy.

526
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:41,380
Then... do you love him?

527
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:45,780
What is love?

528
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:49,930
You stumped me.

529
00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:59,400
When I first started dating Chen Yiming,

530
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:05,510
my heart rate would speed up and my palm would sweat.

531
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:12,280
My heart rate would speed up and my palm would sweat only when I go see clients.

532
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:16,230
With that Su Lixing, we are like an old couple.

533
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:20,560
We're not disgusted with each other when we meet up. But we don't miss each other when we're separated.

534
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:23,770
That's already very good. He Mu and I

535
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:27,470
don't miss each other when we are separated. We feel tired when we are together.

536
00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:29,180
Then, are you still going to marry him?

537
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:30,960
Of course.

538
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:37,360
Although he is bored and inflexible, all of his other conditions are very good.

539
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:41,630
You guys told me to not be so picky; thus, I decided to listen to you two this time.

540
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:44,460
Xiaoling, you've changed.

541
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:48,400
I've just thought it through. Although I can't change him,

542
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:54,170
I can change myself. As long as I don't pursue perfection, he is the perfect one.

543
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:56,970
Those words make sense.
