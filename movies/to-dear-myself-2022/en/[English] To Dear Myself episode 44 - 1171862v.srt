[Episode 44]

4
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,500
Professor Gao! Professor Gao!

5
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,000
Data! The data!

6
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,400
Where is it? The system!

7
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,800
God.

8
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,100
Professor Gao!

9
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,500
We... We...

10
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,000
We just failed?

11
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,900
Didn't you say we would definitely make it this time?

12
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:50,850
Professor Gao, didn't you say we would succeed this time?

13
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:53,660
Lei Haowen,

14
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,100
you... you said we are going to make it, right?

15
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:09,150
You can't do this to me.

16
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,190
You can't do this to me.

17
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,800
Are you kidding me?

18
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:20,300
Haowen! Haowen!

19
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,300
Haowen!

20
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,900
Haowen!

21
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,600
Haowen!

22
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,400
Lei Haowen!

23
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,800
Haowen!

24
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,000
Go inside and inspect it.

25
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,400
You two keep the order here!

26
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,400
You didn't bring keys?

27
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,290
Do you feel better?

28
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,670
I can bear this.

29
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,650
Haowen,

30
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,200
I'm not sure if he can bear this or not.

31
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,600
Sorry, the subscriber you dialed is turned off.

32
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,600
He turned off his phone.

33
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,000
Is he okay?

34
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,600
I'm going to look for him.

35
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,800
Xiaoling! Xiaoling!

36
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,600
Have you finished? Go back!

37
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,100
It's done.

38
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,600
It's all gone.

39
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:33,890
Everything exploded.

40
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,100
Let's go back and talk.

41
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,300
- Come on! Go! 
 - Leave me alone!

42
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,200
If you stay longer, you will get sick! Go back with me first.

43
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,800
Get up.

44
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,700
You go back by yourself!

45
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,600
Are you out of your mind?

46
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,800
Go. Go.

47
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,200
I told you it was done!

48
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,900
It was burned out!

49
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,000
Calm down! Go back first!

50
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,600
- Don't touch me! 
 - Go!

51
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,600
Are you crazy?

52
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,900
Hello?

53
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:32,000
It's good to hear he is fine.

54
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,900
Do you want to talk to him?

55
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,210
No.

56
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,000
Don't tell him that I'm looking for him.

57
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,200
Drink this when it's hot. Don't catch a cold.

58
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,700
It's nothing. Just a time of failure.

59
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:01,010
Not one time.

60
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,100
This has been thousands of times.

61
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,000
So what?

62
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,200
You can start over at the worst.

63
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:17,450
I can't start over any more.

64
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:21,360
We ran out of money already.

65
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,600
What if you invest again?

66
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:33,200
Today's explosion has made the local headlines.

67
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,300
Think about it.

68
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,540
Who will be willing to invest in us?

69
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:43,450
Gu Xiaoling.

70
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:47,750
Gu Xiaoling.

71
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,200
Gone.

72
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,600
[Outbreak of fire in one of Shanghai's battery lab]

73
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,600
Siyu, Director Gong is here.

74
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:47,140
What's your plan now?

75
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,400
Director Gong,

76
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:54,200
to be honest, I was also overwhelmed a couple of days ago,

77
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,800
I also thought about giving up.

78
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,200
I just used ten million to learn a lesson.

79
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,600
I understand.

80
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,400
If you decide, I respect that.

81
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,000
But Dubu project

82
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,300
is Professor Gao's whole life research.

83
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,400
So many people have paid for it.

84
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,400
It also includes your investment.

85
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,000
I also don't think that I should give up easily.

86
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,000
That's also right.

87
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,500
I think since we've done this much, we'd better not give up.

88
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,800
What if we think of a way to finance another round?

89
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,000
Let's delay the financing for a little while.

90
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,400
Right. We've prepared to pause the experiment now.

91
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,800
Professor Gao and I will need to go through the experiments,

92
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,400
including all the failed experiments.

93
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,100
After Professor Gao and Liu Yang's result come out,

94
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,300
we can discuss further the next plans.

95
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,200
How long do you need?

96
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,700
Three months.

97
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:58,240
Or half a year.

98
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,500
It's okay. This is how Professor Gao is like normally.

99
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,800
Director Gong, we will make it definitely.

100
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,800
So, please don't lose confidence in us.

101
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,600
Your investment will be paid back for sure.

102
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,800
Then I look forward to it.

103
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,300
Why don't I see Lei Haowen?

104
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,200
He was more heartbroken than all of us.

105
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,700
Why?

106
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,000
It's a long story.

107
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:58,410
Haowen,

108
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:01,260
what if we asked Liu Yang to play basketball together?

109
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:03,510
No interest.

110
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,800
How about this? I will buy you a few drinks.

111
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,400
What do you think?

112
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:16,000
Unless you drink with me until I die.

113
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,100
Otherwise, I will suffer more pain.

114
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,300
Cheer up, okay?

115
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,800
No.

116
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,500
Even if Dubu fails,

117
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,000
you still have Yiwen company.

118
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:36,330
I started up a business for her.

119
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,700
Now she is getting married.

120
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:43,800
Yiwen company doesn't mean anything to me.

121
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,200
You are both here.

122
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,600
Director Gong,

123
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,100
please sit.

124
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,400
Haowen. Haowen.

125
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,000
Unless we sell Yiwen company,

126
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,200
Then I will get ¥5,000,000. That will make some sense to me.

127
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,800
What are you talking about?

128
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,400
I see I can still earn some money from here.

129
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,300
You are going to sell it?

130
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,600
Director Gong,

131
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:19,000
I will sell all my shares of Yiwen to you.

132
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
¥5,000,000. Do you want it?

133
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,200
Director Gong, he is heartbroken and he is crazy now.

134
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,390
I'm not!

135
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,200
¥5,000,000. Do you want it?

136
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,700
Do you want it?

137
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,800
I found it!

138
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,600
Yes! I found it!

139
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,000
Great!

140
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,400
Everyone had so much hope for this research.

141
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,700
However, I didn't expect this result.

142
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,300
People say failure is common

143
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,000
but a bit hard to accept.

144
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,600
Then, what about you?

145
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,600
I'm all right.

146
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,800
The fact that Zhizhi and Yuwei didn't go to Europe already makes me so happy.

147
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,100
I can't be too greedy and have everything I want.

148
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,400
How is Siyu?

149
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,200
Except for Professor Gao, she's the strongest.

150
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,800
Professor Gao said that this explosion happened because the concentration of the battery was not enough.

151
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:46,400
If we fix the concentration issue, then we have hope.

152
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,000
I've heard enough of this kind of talk.

153
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,300
You say there are little problems every time.

154
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,600
Every time you say there's a breakthrough.

155
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,600
Every time, you say there's hope.

156
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,500
Every time, you're sure that this experiment will be successful.

157
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,200
But every time, it still fails.

158
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,800
This time, it's real.

159
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,200
Isn't it real every time?

160
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,600
Haowen?

161
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,000
Siyu also came?

162
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,000
Hi.

163
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,100
Hi.

164
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,200
I'm trying to encourage Haowen to continue.

165
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,800
Okay. Then you two can talk.

166
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,800
As long as we try one more time...

167
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,800
I've been severely damaged by you repeating these words over and over again.

168
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,200
I don't want to hear those words again.

169
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Besides, the ¥5,000,000 that Director Gong invested has all been used up.

170
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,600
We have no money.

171
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,100
Since we've already gotten this far, we have no reason to quit.

172
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,800
When others research batteries,

173
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,000
they spend billions.

174
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,800
We only had ¥10,000,000.

175
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:59,200
With ¥10,000,000, you expected to change the world? Stop dreaming.

176
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,500
Haowen.

177
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,000
I don't want to lie to myself.

178
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,800
Yiming, come play with me.

179
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,200
I'm coming.

180
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,300
Siyu,

181
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:23,240
how about we sell Xinlu?

182
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,600
Then we'll have no relationship with Dubu.

183
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,600
Xinlu is simply a dream.

184
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,200
Our investment into Dubu was unique with some shares.

185
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,500
It's worth nothing.

186
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:41,100
If it's worth nothing, then even if we wanted to sell it, it wouldn't sell for anything.

187
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:48,000
What if I can sell it for a good price?

188
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,400
Still no.

189
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,600
Why not?

190
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,200
Because Dubu will be successful.

191
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,400
Dubu will never be successful!

192
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,600
It will!

193
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,200
Siyu, sell it!

194
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,000
I'm the chairperson of Xinlu.

195
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,900
If I say I won't sell it, then we won't!

196
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,600
Wasn't the lab destroyed?

197
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,700
Why does Siyu still want to continue the research?

198
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,300
Only parts of it were destroyed. If we get another ¥1,000,000,

199
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:37,200
we can purchase some equipment and restart the research.

200
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,400
Do you have ¥1,000,000?

201
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,800
Let's not even talk about ¥1,000,000 right now.

202
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,300
We don't even have ¥1,000 right now.

203
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,200
Why did you come back to late today?

204
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,400
I had some things to do this evening.

205
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,900
I'll get it.

206
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,200
Oh, right.

207
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,800
Did you hear about what happened to Professor Gao's lab?

208
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,600
- It exploded, didn't it? 
 - Yes.

209
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,600
I heard about it.

210
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Didn't you have a disagreement on share and price?

211
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
They are suffering defeat now.

212
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I think maybe it's a good opportunity to buy it at a low price.

213
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,400
Investments aren't made according to price. They are made according to worth.

214
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,000
If it's worth it, then it can be invested in no matter how expensive.

215
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,500
But if it's not worth it, then no matter how cheap it is, we still cannot get involved.

216
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:09,600
We can safely say that their project is now completely worthless.

217
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,400
But I heard that they still have a lot of hope.

218
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,800
If they were to do one more experiment, there's a chance of success.

219
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,200
What they mean by "one more experiment"

220
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,600
is that it is their last gamble.

221
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,100
We cannot trust it at all.

222
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,200
Then if it's like this, I...

223
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,900
I want to sell my house.

224
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,200
In your name,

225
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,800
I will lend this money

226
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:50,600
to Li Siyu and help them continue the research.

227
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:57,120
What do you mean by this?

228
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:06,200
In the past, weren't Siyu and I together?

229
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:10,800
I don't want to see her lost, so I want to help her,

230
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,000
but I don't want others to misunderstand.

231
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,400
Thinking we have former affection between us.

232
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,600
I think giving her money under your name would be the best solution.

233
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:26,400
Also, she had a misunderstanding and some prejudice with you, right?

234
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,200
This time, we might

235
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:32,300
be able to revert back to your old relationship together.

236
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,100
Yiming,

237
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,800
you're so kind and considerate.

238
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,800
I wasn't wrong about you.

239
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:55,790
So you agree?

240
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,800
I can understand that you want to help Siyu.

241
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,800
The truth is that I also want to help her.

242
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,800
However, this kind of method is not helpful to her. In fact, it will harm her.

243
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,210
Why do you say that?

244
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,800
Professor Gao, Siyu, and I have interacted many times.

245
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,600
I understand that project very well.

246
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:20,000
Even though all reasoning points to the conclusion that this project cannot be successful,

247
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,800
they just won't accept it.

248
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,400
Professor Gao is such a stubborn person.

249
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:29,600
It's been around ten years, but he still cannot consider anyone else's suggestions.

250
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,400
Now, Siyu has been affected by him.

251
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,800
She is obsessed with this project.

252
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,600
Yes. The two of them indeed are very stubborn.

253
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,000
So my advice is...

254
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
that they do not need support right now.

255
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,100
Instead, they need to stop in order to prevent more losses.

256
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,400
They should stop?

257
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,800
You can't give them more money.

258
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,400
Doing that isn't helpful to them.

259
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:57,300
This will make them bogged down deeper and deeper into their obsession.

260
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:02,900
If you really want to help them, you need to coax them to give this project up.

261
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:08,500
Professor Gao can work in the lab I just bought,

262
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,300
and Siyu...

263
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,400
Doesn't she like starting businesses?

264
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,400
I can support her in other projects.

265
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:19,990
What do you think?

266
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,550
That's good, too.

267
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:17,000
The lab is only temporarily closed. Everyone can go home and rest for a while.

268
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,600
Professor Gao, Liu Yang, the other investors, and I

269
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,000
will surely not give up this project.

270
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,600
After Laidianle broke down, I lost everything.

271
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:30,100
But after less than a year, I stood up again.

272
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,600
So I believe

273
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,500
that this time, we will also be able to rise up.

274
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:39,800
Sister Siyu, now, everyone outside says that our project is fated to fail.

275
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,400
What would they possibly understand?

276
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,800
Exactly.

277
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,320
Why must we listen to

278
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,600
what outsiders have to say about our lives?

279
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,800
Our own lives are managed by ourselves. Whatever we say goes.

280
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,000
I know.

281
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,200
There are also many people saying that both Professor Gao and I are stubborn,

282
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,700
but we are just chasing after what we want.

283
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:01,700
Even if we are fated to fail,

284
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:05,200
then at least we once wholeheartedly believed that

285
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,200
we were once stubborn against all odds and worked hard.

286
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,600
Even if there are no results, at least I won't have any regrets in life.

287
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,200
You've worked hard.

288
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,600
Sister Siyu, as long as you call for us, we will return immediately.

289
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,400
Okay.

290
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,500
Please rest well in this time period.

291
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,300
You've worked hard.

292
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,300
Sister Siyu, we will wait for you.

293
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,700
- Wait for me. 
 - I will.

294
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,600
Sister Siyu.

295
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,100
- Bye-bye. 
 - Bye, Sister Siyu.

296
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:16,360
Is your mood a bit better?

297
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,200
It's okay.

298
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,600
A friend from the industrial and commercial bureau informed me that our Xinlu company's records there

299
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,000
lack some material. It needs the shareholder's signature.

300
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,700
What file?

301
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:32,210
Just some amendments to the articles of association.

302
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,600
They've been signed before. Just sign it.

303
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,000
I still want to read it.

304
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,500
Gu Xiaoling is getting her marriage certificate with He Mu next week.

305
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,200
If you should let go, then do it.

306
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,300
Can you let go of Yiming?

307
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,600
Yiming can't let go of you either.

308
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,800
When the two of us went out for a drink, he got drunk.

309
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,300
He kept reciting your name.

310
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,000
Here. Just sign it.

311
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:32,010
I will send it there first.

312
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:59,600
President Wang, the purchase of GB is finished.

313
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,100
Got it.

314
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,000
Li Siyu!

315
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,400
Thank you.

316
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,500
The passcode is your birthdate.

317
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:43,620
This was from Wang Ziru?

318
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,800
It had nothing to do with her.

319
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,100
This was my own will.

320
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,400
Where did you get that much money?

321
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,400
I sold that house.

322
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,200
Are you an idiot?

323
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,000
If you sell that house, it will be very hard to get it back!

324
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,400
But you need money.

325
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,800
Why did you do this?

326
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,100
Siyu,

327
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:12,200
ever since we first met,

328
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,400
- you were always— 
 - Stop right there.

329
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,800
Don't reminisce about the past.

330
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,100
Fine.

331
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,000
The truth is that I always had regret.

332
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,400
If back then, I supported your dream—

333
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,000
Don't talk to me about dreams.

334
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,100
Then let's talk about the present.

335
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,600
Presently, we have no relationship whatsoever.

336
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,200
We do.

337
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:41,500
When I had nowhere to go, you gave me ¥300,000.

338
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:52,100
I sold the house quickly and didn't make much money.

339
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,800
I paid back the loan of the bank and the relatives.

340
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,200
I only have ¥1,050,000 RMB.

341
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,800
It's all here.

342
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,100
You don't owe me.

343
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,010
Rest assured.

344
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:13,900
In the future, the two of us will have no connection whatsoever.

345
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:20,520
Chen Yiming.

346
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,200
Crazy.

347
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Everyone is crazy.

348
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,100
Everything is crazy.

349
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
We have signed TS with FCC group.

350
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,200
Now we are just waiting for the accountant's audit report

351
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,500
and the due diligence report.

352
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:54,000
In the end, what was the price agreed upon?

353
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Tianye Group will take 23% of Lubao's shares

354
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,200
and transfer them over to FCC Group.

355
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,700
The price is fifty billion.

356
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,600
That's wonderful!

357
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,400
We must drink some wine to celebrate this!

358
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,200
- We must drink. 
 - Yes.

359
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,800
President Wang.

360
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,200
Director Zeng,

361
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Director Zeng.

362
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,500
Toast to the day we are rewarded.

363
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:21,100
Toast to the day we are rewarded.

364
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,600
Now it seems like the longest we'd have to wait is three months.

365
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,800
We can say goodbye to Lubao.

366
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,600
Yes.

367
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:37,500
After three months, when this fund quits,

368
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:40,800
we will continue the contract with you.

369
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,400
We will invest more money.

370
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,600
Thank you for your trust.

371
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,400
- Wish our cooperation to be happy and successful. 
 - Wish our cooperation to be happy and successful.

372
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:50,000
I hope we can continue the harvest.

373
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,600
Please come in.

374
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,600
Please sit.

375
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,200
You know Gao Zhengdao?

376
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,600
Yes. What's up?

377
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,400
We've succeeded!

378
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,800
The membrane-less battery!

379
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,400
A scientific feat!

380
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:35,400
From today on, we enter a generation of membrane-less batteries.

381
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,600
Membrane-less batteries will be unparalleled in the world!

382
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,600
From today on, it is realized!

383
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,800
The comments say

384
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,900
membrane-less batteries are on their way out.

385
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:50,190
Some people among them mentioned Lubao especially.

386
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:56,000
The companies with similar business with Lubao are very active in the comments section.

387
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,200
I reckon that the share price of them will drop tomorrow.

388
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
This will definitely draw FCC's attention.

389
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,200
This will also definitely

390
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,400
impact our plan.

391
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,600
It won't. Don't worry.

392
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:13,400
I'm prepared well for this old man.

393
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:18,100
His news won't interfere with our plan at all.

394
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,400
Since President Wang is so sure

395
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,000
then I don't have any other comments.

396
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:30,200
Okay! Let's wait for

397
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,900
President Wang's report after three months.

398
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,600
I won't let you two down for sure.

399
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,800
All right!

400
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,300
Cheers!

401
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,200
Liu Yang,

402
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:28,000
congratulations!

403
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,700
Why hasn't Haowen shown up?

404
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:43,800
Right.

405
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:47,000
Why should we be without him today?

406
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,600
The number you dialed is powered off.

407
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,900
His phone is powered off.

408
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:01,430
He has been in a bad mood recently.

409
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,080
It's about Gu Xiaoling getting married?

410
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:17,390
Yiming, Li Siyu told me to

411
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:22,140
propose a toast to you for her.

412
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,800
Thank you.

413
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:48,800
Where is she right now?

414
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:52,800
After Dubu's success was announced, she left.

415
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,000
She doesn't answer phone calls and reply to messages.

416
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,800
President Wang, cheers.

417
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,200
President Wang, I really admire you. Everything is in your control.

418
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:29,700
I just want to make sure that everything is absolutely safe.

419
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,700
When should I show my hand to them?

420
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,900
The faster the better.

421
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:35,100
I get it.

422
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,200
By the way, Director Gong,

423
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:46,600
didn't you say that they will have new progress in 3 to 6 months?

424
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,800
How did they make new progress so quickly?

425
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,000
I heard that Chen Yiming gave money to Li Siyu.

426
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,600
So they started the new experiment so quickly.

427
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:58,000
But luckily we had your overall arrangement early, President Wang.
