 [To Dear Myself]

00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 [Episode 33]

4
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,630
- Your food. 
 - Okay.

5
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,900
- Please enjoy. 
 - Thank you.

6
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,340
- Do you want some? 
 - Yeah.

7
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,800
Actually, I have some good wine in my car,

8
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,800
but I didn't drive today.

9
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,700
Y-Your wine

10
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,200
is pretty expensive,

11
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,300
I think it's probably worth more than this restaurant.

12
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,200
Do you understand wine?

13
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,600
M-My friend told me.

14
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,100
He said that

15
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,000
even if you have the money you may not necessarily be able to buy it.

16
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,600
I actually don't know much about wine.

17
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,900
But sometimes one has to pretend to understand.

18
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,000
- Cheers. 
 - Cheers.

19
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,600
The boss who sold me that wine

20
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,200
sold me an even more expensive wine later on.

21
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,500
I totally forgot where I put it after I bought it.

22
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,800
It's called...

23
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:56,000
Luo Mandi or Luo Manshi...

24
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,200
I even looked it up on Baidu, but can't remember it.

25
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,600
Sister Ziru, you're

26
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,500
quite straight-forward.

27
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:12,370
Am I?

28
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,100
Yes, that is what I really think.

29
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,200
A lot of people say I'm

30
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,800
sly and scheming.

31
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,600
They say that I'm heartless and cruel, something like that.

32
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,800
But in my eyes you're

33
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,600
a very wise

34
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,800
calm and collected, rational, assertive,

35
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,800
kind-hearted...

36
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,200
that kind of woman.

37
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,600
Such a good evaluation?

38
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,300
Yes.

39
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:53,030
Am I really rational and calm?

40
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,900
Yes.

41
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:07,190
However, I'm all confused when it comes to you.

42
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,100
Yiming, I actually have a secret.

43
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,000
That night,

44
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,400
I didn't go see a customer.

45
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,400
I also didn't forget about our date.

46
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,400
I was in the office.

47
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,600
Every call and every message you sent,

48
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,800
I actually saw all of them.

49
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,400
Then Sister Ziru why didn't you...

50
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,600
I...

51
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,200
I didn't have the courage to come and see you.

52
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:53,200
I was scared I wouldn't be able to control myself.

53
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:57,000
I must use many minutes just to calm down.

54
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,100
To calm down my emotions just so I can...

55
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,000
answer your one phonecall.

56
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,200
Sister Ziru.

57
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,600
Yiming,

58
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,400
I...it seems that

59
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,800
I like you.

60
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,200
Yiming, I know

61
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:35,000
that this shouldn't happen. I don't know why I would have these feelings.

62
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,400
No matter how I look at it, I shouldn't be like this.

63
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,600
Sister Ziru—

64
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,500
Yiming, I—

65
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:57,200
I'm not asking you for anything.

66
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,990
This is just my own

67
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,800
one-sided feeling.

68
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,200
I also...

69
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,300
don't need your response or reciprocation.

70
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,200
I also don't wish that this

71
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,200
will give you any pressures.

72
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,400
No, Sister Ziru, I...

73
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,600
How can I—？

74
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,000
Yiming,

75
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,600
today, I

76
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,600
got the courage to ask you out,

77
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,400
it's because I

78
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:38,180
I thought it through.

79
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,030
This just my one-sided feelings.

80
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:48,100
Today, saying all this out loud,

81
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,900
is not to start anything,

82
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,800
it is to end things.

83
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,200
After today,

84
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,300
I won't talk about it again.

85
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,800
I might still continue to love you...

86
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,800
deeply...

87
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,100
but I won't let you see it.

88
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,800
Sister Ziru,

89
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,000
I—

90
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,600
Yiming,

91
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,800
don't worry,

92
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,200
I won't ask anything of you.

93
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,000
From today on,

94
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,600
we are still friends.

95
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,800
We are still sister and brother.

96
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,200
We can still confide in each other.

97
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,800
After drinking this, this will all be in the past.

98
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,400
Annie.

99
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:26,460
President Wang.

100
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,200
Go see how Chen Yiming is doing right now.

101
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,200
Director Chen came here very early in the morning.

102
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,800
Really?

103
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,600
He even left this.

104
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,400
Did he say anything else?

105
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,800
He didn't say anything.

106
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,200
Where is he now?

107
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,200
He's already left.

108
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,200
This shouldn't be.

109
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,080
Go on out.

110
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,000
Annie.

111
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:03,800
Go find someone to find out about where Chen Yiming is

112
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:07,000
and what his plans are for the future.

113
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,400
Okay.

114
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,900
Did you apply for the reimbursement?

115
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,000
I didn't get it for this month yet.

116
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,900
I've already handed in the reimbursement form for 1 week yet it still hasn't been approved.

117
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,800
Don't even mention it.

118
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,800
The online promotion fee that I submitted 2 weeks ago still hasn't been approved.

119
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,600
Our company isn't having problems, is it?

120
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,800
That's very possible.

121
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,200
Don't believe in rumors. Don't spread rumors.

122
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,300
What does this mean?

123
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,500
This is the remaining balance in the company's bank account.

124
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,600
This is this month's employee salaries and all other expenses.

125
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,800
This is the debt

126
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,400
that we were supposed to have paid a long time time ago.

127
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,800
We've talked with dozens of new franchisees lately.

128
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,600
As long as they sign the contracts officially, then the deposits will come in.

129
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,200
I calculated it. We can keep going for at most one month.

130
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,800
Unless you can ensure that we have 10,000 new paying customers

131
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,600
and that must continue for 2 years.

132
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,600
The internet industry requires a lot of money to burn.

133
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:06,200
We won't be able to see results for another 3-5 years.

134
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,000
Only you and I know this, right?

135
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,400
Let me go talk to President Pan again.

136
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,000
That's our only option now.

137
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,200
Help me prepare all the financial statements

138
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,600
so I can report them to him.

139
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,000
Okay. Then I'll go do that.

140
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,600
President Pan, when are you free?

141
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,600
I want to report Laidianle's newest progress to you.

142
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,240
What's up?

143
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,400
Is our company out of money?

144
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:17,000
What are you talking about? We have plenty of cash.

145
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,400
Money from investors.

146
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,700
I saw that our bank account has only ¥43.

147
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,200
How do you know?

148
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,300
I hacked Sister Fan's computer.

149
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,400
Guan Xiaotang, there you go again!

150
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,800
What did you promise me?

151
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,400
You scared me to death. Just wait until I finish talking before you hit me.

152
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,000
Tell me. Are you thinking of handling it all by yourself?

153
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,300
I am the boss. If I don't handle it, who will?

154
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,600
Wait a moment.

155
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,300
What are you doing?

156
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,200
I asked what are you doing?

157
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,700
[¥9,420.95 was transferred to you.]

158
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,200
What does this mean?

159
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:09,200
From now on, I won't be getting a salary. I'm going to volunteer.

160
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,200
To save the company in danger.

161
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:16,400
Then what are you going to eat and drink? How are you going to pay rent?

162
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,000
I'll stay at my friend's place.

163
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,700
I can freeload for food and drinks as well as the internet.

164
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,600
Good job.

165
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,600
No, wait!  What does this mean?

166
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,800
I appreciate your good intentions,

167
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:45,000
but not a penny will be missing from your salary.

168
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
If you dare to refuse or return it, then you can leave right now.

169
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,600
You're treating me like an outsider right now. Am I an outsider?

170
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,500
There is no such thing as an insider or outsider at Laidianle.

171
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,800
You're all employees. Hurry up and accept it.

172
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,200
Don't force me to fire you.

173
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 I'm out of town right now. Wait for my return. 

174
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,800
Old Bai.

175
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,200
Come, I want to talk to you.

176
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,300
- What? 
 - Come.

177
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,600
Sit.

178
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,000
What's so secretive?

179
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,200
Just now, you said that the online promotion fee hasn't been approved yet, right?

180
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,000
- Yeah. 
 - How much?

181
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,600
¥12,000.

182
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,000
Why are you asking?

183
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,800
Look at your phone.

184
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,600
[¥12,000 was transferred to you.]

185
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,000
This doesn't follow our finance protocols, right?

186
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,200
It's fine. It completely follows protocols.

187
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,300
Our focus is to work hard anyway.

188
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,600
Work hard!

189
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,400
Then I'm going to accept it!

190
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,200
[Lantian Kindergarten welcomes you.]

191
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,800
Teacher Dai!

192
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,200
Liu Yuwei, welcome back!

193
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:47,000
Susan! Xiao Xiao! Brother Hao Hao!

194
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,800
Yuwei, where did you go?

195
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,100
Yuwei, we missed you so much!

196
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:55,400
Yuwei, I found something interesting, let me take you to look at it!

197
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,600
Okay.

198
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,400
Please come with me inside.

199
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:17,100
Yuwei's kindergarten. Yuwei's kindergarten. Yuwei's kindergarten.

200
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:28,500
Yuwei's kindergarten. Yuwei's kindergarten.

201
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,400
Yuwei's kindergarten. Yuwei's kindergarten.

202
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,400
Yuwei's kindergarten.

203
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,300
Director Su, I will come to visit you next time.

204
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,800
Cheers! You've worked hard.

205
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,800
Thank you for your hard work. Thank you.

206
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,800
Help yourself!

207
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,900
Don't go.

208
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,500
Have some to eat!

209
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,240
Sister Zhizhi, you're back.

210
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,200
Thank you!

211
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,600
Come and have some snacks.

212
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,400
Sister Zhizihi!

213
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,400
Come to eat with us! Brother Xinyi bought them.

214
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,550
What's wrong?

215
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,600
Did you get kicked out again?

216
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,400
Your office is quite lively.

217
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,600
It's just today.

218
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,800
Ziping, bring the latest sample for President Luo.

219
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,200
Please wait a moment.

220
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,900
- Here. President Luo. 
 - Thank you.

221
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,200
Cheers to a pleasant collaboration!

222
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,800
Cheers to a pleasant collaboration.

223
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,200
Eat some pastries.

224
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,600
Okay.

225
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,800
President Luo, this is our latest battery.

226
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,100
Okay.

227
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,500
This is our company's internal report.

228
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,200
President Luo, what's wrong?

229
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,800
Were there peanuts in the pastry I just ate?

230
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,200
- Are there peanuts? 
 - Is there?

231
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,600
Are there peanuts in this?

232
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,600
I think it does.

233
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,200
President Luo! President Luo! Are you okay?

234
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,000
Call the ambulance!

235
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,600
Call 120!

236
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,600
What's wrong?

237
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,600
Are you allergic to peanuts?

238
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,600
Did you bring medicine?

239
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,600
In my bag.

240
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,200
Bring his bag! Bring his bag!

241
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,200
The ambulance will be here soon.

242
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,200
How do you feel?

243
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Better?

244
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,800
Thank you.

245
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,800
Hurry and take him to the hospital.

246
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,800
Slowly, slowly.

247
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,300
Quick, quick.

248
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,200
- Did you really resign? 
 - Yup.

249
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,800
Why?

250
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,000
I couldn't work there anymore.

251
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,700
Didn't you just get a promotion and raise?

252
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,600
It's another reason.

253
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,800
Tell me about it.

254
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,400
I haven't thought it through yet, how do I talk about it with you?

255
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,000
How about teaming up with me?

256
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,200
What?

257
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:54,200
What team? An idol group?

258
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,800
No singing.

259
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:59,400
The team's content will be the path to money.

260
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,500
Let's start a company.

261
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,600
Hurry!

262
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,600
Think about it! There is definitely a future there.

263
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,000
[Aunt]

264
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:22,210
Hello, Aunt?

265
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:23,900
Hey, Yiming.

266
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:29,090
Could you repay the ¥100,000 I lent you as soon as possible?

267
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:30,960
Didn't we agree that I'll repay it by the end of this year?

268
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,210
Well, didn't the housing prices drop recently? 

269
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:38,220
Your cousin wants to buy a house. As his mom, 

270
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,990
I should support him, right?

271
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:45,890
All right. I'll think of a way to get the money.

272
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:49,700
Okay. Could you give it to me by the end of the month?

273
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,480
I will try my best.

274
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:55,300
- That's it then.  
 - Okay. Bye.

275
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:25,330
[Your mortgage is overdue by two months and comes out to be ¥39232.95. The account ending in 1366 does not have enough funds. Please pay as soon as possible to avoid it from affecting your records.] 

276
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:30,190
You guys play.

277
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,420
Here.

278
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:48,850
Say, is there any way for me to earn ¥10,0000 immediately?

279
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:53,400
There are lots. There is a book with ways written.

280
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,540
What book?

281
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,710
"Criminal Law."

282
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:59,240
I'm being serious.

283
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:04,070
A serious and simple way is that we do Wemedia. 
(TN: Wemedia is the Chinese term for private citizen media such as blogs, forums, WeChat, etc.)

284
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:08,270
We can earn ¥1,000,000 per year. Would you still need to worry about ¥100,000 with that?

285
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:10,980
All right.

286
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,910
- It's settled then? 
 - It's settled.

287
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:20,270
I will resign once I get to work.

288
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,090
Come on!

289
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,040
You haven't left yet?

290
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,620
Director Yuan,

291
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:17,280
I'll be leaving soon.

292
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,650
By the way, how is President Luo now?

293
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:21,700
He's been discharged from the hospital already.

294
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,020
This illness sure does come quickly and go just as quickly.

295
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:29,450
How did you know that he was allergic to peanuts?

296
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:36,000
My daughter is also allergic to peanuts. That's why I don't dare buy snacks for her from outside.

297
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,790
I make them for her at home.

298
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:48,250
Well... thank you for today.

299
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:52,580
If this President Luo had any mishaps at our company,

300
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:57,440
then it would be over for all of us.

301
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,430
Director Yuan,

302
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:07,440
I want to ask you something.

303
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,370
Go ahead.

304
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:13,710
About Qijue's Director Su,

305
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:18,360
I've already visited him for nine times. I get kicked out every time.

306
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:23,370
I wanted to ask, how do I communicate with a client like this?

307
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:27,720
I actually wanted to tell you that you don't need to deal with Mr. Su anymore.

308
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,710
Didn't you say—

309
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:33,280
He wants to give the order to his own special clients so he has been rejecting us.

310
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:36,510
We normally just give up on this type of client.

311
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:41,380
Then this month, I...

312
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:49,490
Go meet with this client tomorrow.

313
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:55,340
He likes ping-pong. There has been an international competition recently. Buy and deliver tickets to him.

314
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,650
Thank you, Director Yuan.

315
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:02,980
If there is nothing else, you should go home earlier.

316
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:52,730
- Hey, Zhizhi. 
 - Let me help you. 
 - Thank you.

317
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,240
How come there are so many frozen foods and instant noodles in here?

318
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,880
I bought these for my son.

319
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,890
How old is he?

320
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:03,470
He's a first-year in middle school.

321
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:06,870
His body is still growing. It isn't really good for him to eat these, right?

322
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:09,730
It's better than eating takeout every day, right?

323
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:12,040
Is there no one to take care of him at home?

324
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:15,560
It's just me and my son.

325
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:21,500
You don't have it easy. You need to work hard and take care of your son.

326
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:24,270
No one has it easy. Where do you live? I'll drive you home.

327
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:26,570
No need. You should hurry home and take care of your son.

328
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:28,450
- I'll help you put these in the car. 
 - Okay.

329
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,900
- See you tomorrow. 
 - Yes, see you tomorrow.

330
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:22,040
Lei Haowen and Chen Yiming both resigned.

331
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:25,150
They're creating a Wemedia company together.

332
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:29,830
He's also starting his own business?

333
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:33,630
Say, would you two get back together because of this?

334
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:38,350
Both of you are starting your own business at the same time, going through hardships.

335
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:41,140
You two will probably meet each other again.

336
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:43,140
That's impossible.

337
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:46,530
Hey, honestly,

338
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:50,460
you two broke up because you wanted to start a business.

339
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:54,580
Now that he's also starting a business, perhaps he will come to understand you.

340
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:07,130
I'm going to take a shower now!

341
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:07,950
[Dad]

342
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:10,860
- Hello, Dad? 
- Yiming.

343
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:14,800
What's going on? Your aunt came to the house asking for the money back this morning.

344
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:19,480
She said that you borrowed ¥100,000 from her. She also said that if you do not repay it soon,

345
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,930
her son's house will be gone.

346
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:27,230
If he doesn't have a house, then your third cousin will not be able to get married, then things will get blown up.

347
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:30,810
I heard that you also borrowed money from your fourth older cousin.

348
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:34,990
It was because I bought a house. Right now, I don't have many extra funds to use.

349
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:37,460
Didn't you get a loan

350
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:41,590
Yiming, are you sick?

351
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:44,160
No, Mom.

352
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:47,950
You must tell me the truth. Did something happen to you?

353
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,690
Mom, I'm doing fine. There's really nothing going on.

354
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:54,370
Then, how is Siyu?

355
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:58,000
She's doing well.

356
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,420
T-Then how come you suddenly want so much money? What exactly do you need it for?

357
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:06,500
Mom, it really is for buying a house.

358
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,990
Then, what do you have to say about your aunt's money?

359
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:12,880
Yiming, you asked for ¥600,000 last time. I got ¥200,000 of that

360
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,900
 from my old classmates. Your aun't ¥100,000,

361
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,400
we really can't help you with that.

362
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:24,100
Dad and Mom, don't worry about this.

363
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:27,950
I will take care of it myself. I'm hanging up now.

364
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:02,920
[Yiming's Dad]

365
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:16,230
Uncle.

366
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:21,420
Siyu, let me ask you something. You need to tell me the truth.

367
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,730
Go ahead.

368
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:25,160
What exactly happened to Yiming?

369
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:29,070
I... don't know.

370
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:31,660
How would you not know?

371
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:34,450
I really don't know.

372
00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:39,710
He borrowed over ¥700,000 altogether recently.

373
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,430
We have already broken up.

374
00:34:42,430 --> 00:34:46,000
Oh... W-When did that happen?

375
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,450
A few months ago.

376
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:50,110
How come? Didn't you two buy a house and were preparing to get married?

377
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:54,870
Uncle, I still have some things to do so I'm going to hang up now.

378
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:14,720
Using the name "Yiming May Not Be Amazing,"

379
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:19,360
he registered public accounts on 5-6 different platforms to talk about financial brands.

380
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:22,860
Although the topics are quite niche, the feedback is not good.

381
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:27,290
Right now, his followers and article views are growing steadily.

382
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:29,330
How is his income?

383
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:32,330
The main income is from the articles written and readers' tips.

384
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:36,300
Altogether is around ¥2,000-3,000 .

385
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,770
- All right. You can go now. 
 - Okay.

386
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,410
Hello? Aunt?

387
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:54,130
I transferred ¥5,000 to you just now.

388
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:56,800
Wait, how much?

389
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,540
Isn't it ¥100,000? Why is it just ¥5,000?

390
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:08,200
I can't get the remaining ¥95,000 right now.

391
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,630
Can you give me a few more days?

392
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:14,230
By the end of this month. Not a day more.

393
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:17,240
Okay. Thank you, Aunt.

394
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:42,850
- What's up? 
 - Haowen,

395
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:48,350
can we get an ad by the end of this month?

396
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,090
Don't worry. No problem!

397
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:55,420
Okay. That's it.

398
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:58,580
Bye-bye.

399
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:03,290
- Hello 
 - What are you doing? 
 - Adding water for you.

400
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:07,460
Oh, no need, thank you.

401
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:44,590
[Three best things in life: meeting someone by chance. Understanding without being told. Recovering from illness without treatment. I think reading Yiming's article is like all of the above.]

402
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:56,290
Thank you.

403
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:51,080
This car model has already stopped production. You can no longer sell it for a good price.

404
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,150
You should just keep and use it yourself.

405
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:56,560
Just be honest, how much is it worth?

406
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,620
¥50,000.

407
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:59,440
- ¥50,000? 
 -  Yes.

408
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,560
Think about it.

409
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:15,960
Hello?

410
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,500
Where are you right now?

411
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,670
I'm selling my car.

412
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:21,650
Why are you selling your car?

413
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:28,230
My relative in my hometown is pressing me to repay the debt.

414
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:30,220
I'm just going to pay back whatever I can for now.

415
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:31,500
Did you sell it yet?

416
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,360
I haven't yet.

417
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:36,280
Sell it to me. I give you ¥300,000.

418
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:40,630
What kind of joke is that? I'm busy right now.

419

If you say any words of thanks, then we are not bros.

421
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:21,390
I didn't plan to thank you. I'm here to give you the car key.

422
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:25,360
I don't like your worn out car. Keep it for yourself.

423
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,500
I have something urgent. Catch you later.

424
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,680
Lei Haowen!

425
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,650
I'm going to go meet a client. See you later.

426
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:20,540
Hello, Dad. I will transfer you ¥300,000 right now. Let's repay our relatives and friends.

427
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:24,800
Transfer. I will transfer the money once I hang up.

428
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,080
Okay. Okay. It's fine.

429
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:31,280
Okay. Bye.

430
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:55,590
[Teacher Yiming, the weather has been changing often recently. Please take care of yourself.]

431
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,460
[Thank you. You take care as well.]

432
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:40,190
Wait a moment.

433
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,120
Please enjoy.

434
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:01,160
I heard that there is a new movie that is pretty good.

435
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:03,290
Shall we go and watch it after dinner?

436
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:06,520
According to our plan, after dinner today,

437
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:09,850
we will go to a book store to sit for one hour.

438
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:14,270
Then we'll take a walk around the lake for 30 mins.

439
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:16,770
- Can't we change it? 
 - No.

By the way, I almost forgot.

442
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:48,660
What's this?

443
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:51,800
This is the data analysis

444
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:55,510
of all our WeChat, QQ, text, and other messages since we've known each other.

445
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:58,530
What's this for?

446
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:03,920
In this, are graphs with ratios of our words, numbers of messages,

447
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,690
reply time, and total time.

448
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:13,580
From these graphs, we can see that our communication is considered very smooth.

449
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:16,480
We have gotten to know each other quite well.

450
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:28,660
According to the data analysis, I think our relationship can be upgraded again.

451
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:32,530
I suggest, when we take a walk tonight,

452
00:44:32,530 --> 00:44:37,650
we can have some more intimate body touches. For example, kissing.

453
00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:48,590
Do you have any requirements on kissing postures?

454
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:54,950
In regards to that... I think doing it naturally is best.
