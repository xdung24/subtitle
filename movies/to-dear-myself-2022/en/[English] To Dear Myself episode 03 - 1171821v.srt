00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,070
[Episode 3]

4
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,910
It's the middle of the night and you're awake. What are you doing?

5
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,910
I'll be done soon.

6
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,540
What will be done soon?

7
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,900
Are you still planning to associate with them?

8
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,000
Didn't I tell you to just forget about it?

9
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,020
I've thought about it. We can't act without due consideration.

10
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,510
- Why? 
 - Look...

11
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:38,170
There's no need for me to elaborate about Miao Miao's family.

12
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:40,410
Linda is only 4 years old

13
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,790
and she can speak 3 languages.

14
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:47,370
Xing Xing's parents got their doctorates from abroad.

15
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:50,070
Also, I've heard that William's grandfather

16
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,910
seems to be from one of Shanghai's, what was it,

17
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:56,140
very famous families.

18
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:02,710
What does everything you're talking about have to do with us?

19
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,800
Of course, it has something to do with us.

20
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,510
Say, we've spent so much money

21
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:10,830
and asked favors from so many people to get Yuwei into such a good kindergarten.

22
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,540
What did we do all that for? Isn't it for

23
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,860
her to be in the best environment

24
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:19,000
to grow up with the most outstanding kids of her age?

25
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,530
So I've thought about it.

26
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:25,690
We can't cut our ties with Miao Maio's mom and those other families.

27
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:30,100
Zhizhi, it's very obvious

28
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,920
that we aren't from the same social circle as them.

29
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,460
Isn't it exhausting to spend so much energy sucking up to them?

30
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:39,510
It's not exhausting if it's for Yuwei.

31
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,910
Then, do as you like.

32
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:45,020
How could it be "do as you like"? You must help me.

33
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:48,840
I heard that Miao Miao's grandmother is also a graduate of SJTU. 
 (TN: Shanghai Jiao Tong University)

34
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,550
Tomorrow, come pick up Yuwei with me.

35
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,910
I'll give the cookies to Miao Miao's mom.

36
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:57,680
You help me talk to Miao Miao's mom to form a connection to SJTU.

37
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,420
Then we can just forget about this matter.

38
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:02,910
- I'm not going. 
 - Hey, you must go.

39
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,980
Speaking of it, we were the ones who didn't tell them

40
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:09,180
that we wouldn't attend the group activity, so we were in the wrong.

41
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,330
We need to apologize.

42
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:16,100
If I knew this sooner, then it would've been great to just attend an ordinary kindergarten. Then there wouldn't be so many trivial matters.

43
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,020
Liu Yang!

44
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,470
Do ordinary kindergartens have this many facilities?

45
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,210
Is there one-on-one tutoring?

46
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,780
Do they organize frequent activities outside the school?

47
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:29,010
Do the teachers have advanced early childhood education?

48
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:31,110
Do they have after-school classes that teach Go? 
 (T/N: an abstract strategy board game, in which the aim is to surround more territory than the opponent.)

49
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:33,470
What else is the tuition for?

50
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:38,020
Speaking of tuition. If it were in the past, for a kindergarten with these conditions,

51
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:42,090
our incomes wouldn't be able to cover it. Fortunately, our country's regulations have changed

52
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:44,150
so that we can send her to kindergarten with no stress.

53
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,660
If you want to go, you go.

54
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,860
For Yuwei's sake.

55
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:52,510
All right.

56
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,900
 Have you gone to bed? 

57
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:44,060
Not yet. I'm researching auto repair.

58
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:48,870
Did you contact that spare parts distributor that I recommended to you?

59
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:53,380
I contacted him. I also contacted some other places.

60
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,530
Okay. Then, get some rest soon.

61
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:58,200
You, too. Goodnight.

62
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,530
GM Pan.

63
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,370
I've thought it through.

64
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:47,460
I can't become a team leader.

65
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:50,990
Also, I won't compete to become the Sales Director.

66
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:57,950
That is a rare opportunity though.

67
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:03,080
I'm still young. There will be a lot more opportunities in the future.

68
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:06,740
Sister Yuan doesn't have it easy.

69
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:10,000
Besides, with her capabilities and contributions to Lubao,

70
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,200
that's enough for her to get the position of Sales Director.

71
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,830
Did Yuan Huizhong say something to you while she sobbed?

72
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:26,530
No. This is my own decision.

73
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,500
Li Siyu...

74
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,130
Your personal relationship with her is good.

75
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,040
You coming here to express your stance is a given.

76
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,920
I understand. Go on back.

77
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,260
I didn't come to take a stance. It's what I really want.

78
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:44,100
Then, was what I said to you before a waste of breath?

79
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,630
GM Pan,

80
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:53,030
I know that the company needs competition.

81
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:55,830
But there are some things that I really can't do.

82
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:59,560
The fact that you can't do it doesn't mean that others can't. Do you understand?

83
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:04,740
You don't have to sacrifice yourself to help others. That principle does not exist here.

84
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,110
President Pan, I'm going to persist in this.

85
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:12,610
I got it. You can go.

86
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,690
Hello.

87
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:22,000
Can you help me make another appointment?

88
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,110
Anytime in the near future,... I am free.

89
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,980
Oh. Okay. Thank you so much.

90
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:35,450
Come on in.

91
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:44,570
How did it go?

92
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:49,030
I told him. I won't become a team leader or compete to be a Sales Director.

93
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:51,090
What did Lao Pan say?

94
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:53,010
He kicked me out.

95
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:55,520
Isn't that the same as you not saying anything?

96
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:10,470
Siyu, a company will solicit an employee's opinion

97
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:13,230
before making an appointment of position.

98
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:16,140
As long as you stubbornly don't agree, even Lao Pan

99
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,560
will have no choice.

100
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,720
Then, I'll go see him a little later.

101
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,730
All right.

102
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,270
Come in.

103
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:30,830
- Sister Yuan.  
 - What is it?

104
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:35,160
Tell me.

105
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:37,830
Tell me!

106
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:41,940
Uh... The company just sent out the latest notice.

107
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,870
It concerns...

108
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,920
What notice?

109
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:58,230
 The company's Board of Directors has approved the following decision: 

110
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:01,950
 All employees of the Sales Department will be divided into two teams. 

111
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:07,360
 The sales department's outstanding employee, Yuan Huizhong is appointed as Team One's leader. 

112
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,090
 Li Siyu is appointed as Team Two's leader. 

113
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:13,770
 The team leaders and members will make a two-way selection. 

114
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:18,690
 The appointed team leader must voluntarily serve as the team leader. 

115
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:22,930
Sister Yuan, I'll go on out.

116
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:49,690
- Where's GM Pan? 
 - He's left for a meeting.

117
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,870
- When will he be back? 
 - I don't know.

118
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:54,520
If there is something urgent, you can call him.

119
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:05,790
I really don't know how it turned out like this.

120
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:13,370
When you saw GM Pan today, did you tell him you weren't willing to be a team leader?

121
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:16,420
Are you doubting me?

122
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:20,550
I don't want to doubt you. But this is the reality.

123
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,660
The reality is that I told him I wouldn't become a team leader.

124
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:29,110
If you don't believe me, wait until GM Pan comes back and we'll confront him.

125
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:32,420
Siyu. Siyu!

126
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,920
We've known each other for 7 years.

127
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,830
I not only consider you my student and subordinate,

128
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:50,950
but I also consider you my best friend and sister.

129
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:55,390
I have always been sincere and genuine to you. You have also always been open to me.

130
00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:00,790
Yes, I shouldn't have suspected you.

131
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:05,090
- I really didn't— 
 - You don't need to say anything. I trust you.

132
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:11,380
Since GM Pan has looked fondly upon you, then work hard as a team leader.

133
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,510
Sister Yuan.

134
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,710
I sincerely mean that.

135
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:24,330
GM Pan has already decided. It's not good to fight him in public.

136
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,920
GM Pan is quite insightful.

137
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,400
You indeed have the potential to become the Sales Director.

138
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:37,560
But you are the most suitable choice.

139
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:43,300
Sister Yuan, don't worry.

140
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,900
I will be running alongside you.

141
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,620
I've been right about you since the beginning.

142
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:51,170
Don't worry. When I become Sales Director,

143
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,500
I will continue to take care of you.

144
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,290
Let's go.

145
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:02,830
Go on.

146
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:20,490
Here. Let's cheers to our dear Yiming and send him off.

147
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:23,020
Cheers.

148
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:28,270
Boss, what's your plan next?

149
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:30,340
I plan on resting for a few days.

150
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:33,570
Then I will look for suitable jobs while resting.

151
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:38,000
With our boss's reputation, people will be chasing after him.

152
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,760
There are probably a lot of companies in a queue to hire you right now.

153
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,350
They definitely have queued to the Bund. 
 (T/N: Shanghai's symbolic place where business is booming)

154
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:46,060
Far more than that, the elevated road is full of them.

155
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,860
Enough!

156
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,380
Yiming,

157
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:53,500
do you remember Old Tang?

158
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,320
- Who? 
 - General Manager Tang.

159
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,480
That old GM in Tongli?

160
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:02,460
Their company needs a Planning Director. He asked if you were interested or not.

161
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:06,980
- Forget about it. 
 - The salary and benefits are better than your current job.

162
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,670
 That's right, he can.

163
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:10,560
Right, we can meet up next time.

164
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,860
- I'll pass .
 - With such good conditions,

165
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:17,340
is there no chance that you'll take it at all?

166
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,480
I resigned from Caijin voluntarily.

167
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,650
I have to at least go to a company

168
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:25,410
- that is stronger than Caijin. 
 - That's true.

169
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:29,400
Haowen, what are you whispering about with Boss?

170
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,160
Yes, what are you whispering about?

171
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,560
The Old Tang of Tongli Company, do you know about him?

172
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,180
- I have some impression of him. 
 - I have some impression of him.

173
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,820
He's kneeling and begging Yiming

174
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,980
to go be the Planning Director of his company.

175
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,700
- He won't go definitely. 
 - He won't go definitely..

176
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,780
That's right. He turned his nose up to it.

177
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:46,430
Of course! Old Tang's company is just like a roadside stall.

178
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:51,210
I completely agree. At Caijin, Boss was already doing work that was unworthy of his talent.

179
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:54,620
If he changes companies, no matter the salary or position,

180
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:57,070
they must be better than the one before, right？That's for sure, right?

181
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:59,810
Do we even need to say that? That's a given.

182
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:03,860
Boss, if you go to a better place,

183
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,070
don't forget about us bros.

184
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:08,560
That's right. As long as you give the order, we will go to you immediately.

185
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,920
- Go to you! 
 - Go to you!

186
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,040
- Will you go? 
 - Will you go?

187
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,740
I will definitely go!

188
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:18,500
Cheers! If I become better, I will remember everyone for sure. All right?

189
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:22,830
Cheer! To our forever boss!

190
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:33,510
We made the appointment for 16:00, right?

191
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:35,660
Yes. It's already 15 minutes after.

192
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:38,650
Could it be that she wants to repudiate the debt?

193
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,360
Maybe.

194
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:49,280
Sorry. Sorry. I was here long ago.

195
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,500
But I forgot about time chatting with a worker.

196
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,010
GM Wang, you are also here.

197
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:56,580
Lan Ke,

198
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,490
I just talked to the worker in the maintenance shop.

199
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:01,670
It was very enlightening.

200
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:06,400
The damage bill...

201
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,020
This is Mr. Lan's damage bill.

202
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:11,790
Then let's look at Lan Ke's bill first.

203
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,520
Here, here, here,

204
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:26,340
here, and here. I have crossed out these parts.

205
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,290
I won't take responsibility for those.

206
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,490
What do you mean?

207
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:37,030
These parts weren't caused by this accident.

208
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:40,320
I'm guessing they were repaired before. You can't count them on me.

209
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,760
Also, this and this.

210
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:46,500
You can just change a component. There's no need to change the whole thing.

211
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,520
Also this,

212
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:52,330
do I also need to pay for hardware aging?

213
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:55,600
Lan Ke, we should be repairing the car

214
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,590
and not making me go bankrupt, right?

215
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:09,140
Which worker told you that these don't need to be replaced?

216
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,150
Master Zhong, Master Ceng, and Master Liang.

217
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:14,660
The three best mechanics here at your shop.

218
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:20,660
Libby, ask Master Zhong, Master Ceng, and Master Liang to come over.

219
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,460
Okay.

220
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:26,940
This bag... at most can be considered 90% new.

221
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:29,600
Right now, the market price for this is very high.

222
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,440
That is at a specialty store. We are a secondhand store.

223
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,480
This is this year's celebrity style!

224
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,700
¥22,000.

225
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,520
This is sold out in the whole country.

226
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,680
¥22,500.

227
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,600
This color was the most difficult to buy!

228
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:55,290
¥25,000. No less.

229
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:57,970
Then let me take another look.

230
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:02,320
Be a little more gentle.

231
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:08,140
Master, did you three tell this woman

232
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,350
that these parts don't need to be replaced?

233
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:16,480
This car owner knows the ropes so we just told her the truth.

234
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:23,320
Aren't they all together?

235
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,120
They are not at fault.

236
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,960
I lied about my identity and tricked them.

237
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,560
I can understand

238
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,090
that you guys here at the 4S shop have to earn money,

239
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:38,570
but this money needs to be earned justly.

240
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:42,080
I definitely refuse to pay for the things I shouldn't be responsible for.

241
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:46,050
What do you say?

242
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:50,530
You guys go back first.

243
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:52,490
We're leaving.

244
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:56,060
Mr. Lan, I think...

245
00:18:56,060 --> 00:19:00,710
what this woman said... isn't wrong.

246
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:08,210
Okay, just do as she says.

247
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:11,500
This way I can save more than ¥70,000.

248
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,360
Oh right! I got a card and charged money into it.

249
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,300
There is a 20% discount during working hours.

250
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,950
That'll save at least ¥10,000.

251
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:26,300
What is your job?

252
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,490
I'm a salesperson.

253
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:33,160
- Which company? 
 - Lubao.

254
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,660
The new battery company?

255
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,840
You know about it?

256
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:41,380
- I've heard of it. 
 - GM Wang,

257
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,700
if you want to buy batteries, then just look for me. I'll give you a discount.

258
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,460
Let's talk about the car first.

259
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:55,310
GM Wang, you need to replace the parts for your car.

260
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:59,570
Since they were all originally imported,

261
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:03,000
all of the parts must be shipped from Germany.

262
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,520
I wanted to discuss this matter with you.

263
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,940
Can we do this through my friend?

264
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,600
The price is really discounted

265
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,710
and I can guarantee the quality so you don't have to worry about that.

266
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:16,810
I don't need you to fix my car or pay the fees.

267
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:21,330
That wouldn't be appropriate, right? It is clearly my responsibility.

268
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:24,640
It's okay as long as you pay for that gentleman's car.

269
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,350
I have insurance.

270
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,820
Doing that

271
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:34,590
will mean no rebate for your insurance next year.

272
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:38,490
You're called Li Siyu, right?

273
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:41,500
- Let's add each other's WeChat. 
 - Okay.

274
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:50,530
Then I won't call you GM Wang anymore.

275
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:53,020
I'll call you Sister Ziru.

276
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:56,980
I definitely want to be friends with you.

277
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:00,960
Siyu, you're quite capable.

278
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,670
Isn't it all because money forced me to be?

279
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:06,710
But not everyone can be forced to be capable by money.

280
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:21,260
Sign here and I'll pay you.

281
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:24,020
Let me take a last look at it.

282
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:29,020
[Li Siyu]

283
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:32,290
 [The car situation has been taken care of. Let's meet at the usual place] 

284
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:39,910
I'm not selling it anymore.

285
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:44,700
Miss, what? Miss!

286
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:48,370
Miss! We can discuss it again!

287
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:50,700
I have saved over ¥100,000 now.

288
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,020
I admire myself.

289
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,830
You saved that much money?

290
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:59,810
That's enough for Yuwei to go to elementary until college.

291
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:01,580
It's all thanks to Sister Ziru's generosity.

292
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:04,230
It's all thanks to her being wealthy.

293
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:08,510
Now you know why I definitely have to find a rich boyfriend! You can't be generous until you're rich.

294
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:11,890
May I ask where your rich boyfriend is?

295
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,530
He's on his way, running towards me.

296
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:18,470
Keep an eye on him. Don't let him twist his ankle.

297
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:26,770
Then, have you already paid off that ¥130,000?

298
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:34,600
For you.

299
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,960
What's the meaning of this?

300
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,040
This situation was my fault.

301
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,240
But it all started because of Chen Yiming's proposal,

302
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,580
so we should split the ¥130,000 in half between us.

303
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:49,010
- Do you have money? 
 - No, that's why I'm mortgaging this bag to you!

304
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:51,920
Wait until I save enough money, then I'll redeem it back.

305
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:54,840
Be careful!

306
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:58,260
I don't have the means to take care of your high-end good. Keep it yourself.

307
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,040
That's fine, then let's just leave it with me for now.

308
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:06,570
But before I redeem it, the ownership of this bag is yours.

309
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:08,390
Zhizhi is my witness.

310
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:14,250
Sister Siyu, if you really need money, we have some.

311
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:15,740
That's enough from you as well.

312
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:18,900
Save Liu Yang's bonus for Yuwei to spend.

313
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,600
But to tell you the truth, you're very fortunate that

314
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,600
Yiming can help you pay the loss. Stop being hesitant.

315
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,400
Next time he proposes, just agree.

316
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,600
That's right. Let me tell you.

317
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:36,000
If you miss this chance, then it will be impossible to find someone who is so wholeheartedly devoted to you.

318
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,300
I have nothing bad to say about how Yiming treats me,

319
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:45,000
but I keep having the feeling I'm about to be trapped.

320
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,600
There are still a lot of things I want to do.

321
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,800
- I'm scared to lose my freedom. 
 - Freedom?

322
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:55,000
The reason he wants to get married to you so early is because you want freedom so badly, and he's afraid that you're too fickle.

323
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,800
How am I fickle?

324
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:00,000
You are drinking with customers all the time. How would he feel?

325
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,400
A sweet, sporty, straight man like Chen Yiming is in high demand.

326
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,100
You must cherish him.

327
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,800
Zhizhi, just don't bother with her.

328
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,100
Someday, when she gets dumped by Yiming,

329
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,300
she'll stop being so pretentious.

330
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,000
Yiming, I'm really sorry.

331
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,400
For the past two years, my company has been rapidly expanding.

332
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,100
Back then, I was really desperate for talented people.

333
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:31,200
But in the last few years, the market has changed immensely.

334
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,100
- What kind of changes? 
 - I won't hide it from you.

335
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,100
About 80% of the companies that I started two years ago

336
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:40,600
have been closed down now.

337
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,700
I am still shrinking my businesses.

338
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,800
So,... I'm sorry.

339
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,000
It's fine, GM Zhu. I understand.

340
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,700
How about this? Leave your materials with me.

341
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:57,600
I'll see if my friend's company has any need for your services;

342
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,600
and if they do, I'll definitely keep an eye out for you.

343
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,000
As for my company... I really can't help you.

344
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,800
Well then, thank you, GM Zhu.

345
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,700
I'll take my leave then.

346
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:13,200
GM Zhu, how about eating lunch first? It's lunchtime right now anyway.

347
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,400
I still have some business to attend to.

348
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,000
The meals have already been ordered. How about I go over there and tell them to cook faster?

349
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
There's no need.

350
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,900
I know it's really hard to get a reservation at this restaurant.

351
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,400
How about this?

352
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,600
If I help you get a good job, then you can invite me to a meal.

353
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,600
If I ate this meal with you today,

354
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,600
I would feel in debt to you.

355
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,800
Goodbye.

356
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,400
Goodbye.

357
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,400
 I'm done here, where are we meeting? 

358
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,700
 Hidden Prosperity 

359
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,200
 You can come straight here. 

360
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,200
 I'm already here. 

361
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,100
Hello, Miao Miao's mother.

362
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,400
- You're so early. 
 - I didn't have any other business, so I figured I should come early.

363
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,000
- Your outfit looks so nice today. 
 - It just all right.

364
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,200
Hello.

365
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,600
You're here as well?

366
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,800
- Hello, Yuwei's mom. 
 - Linda's mom, you're here so early.

367
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,000
I made some cookies for you guys.

368
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,100
Xingxing likes to eat Matcha flavor. Here.

369
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,500
Great.

370
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,400
William likes to eat chocolate flavor.

371
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,040
Linda likes little bears.

372
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:04,300
I happen to have some bear-shaped cookie cutters at home.

373
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,400
Thank you!

374
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:11,200
Miao Miao's mom, aren't you dieting? I made some without sugar for you.

375
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,800
Here.

376
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,100
Thank you.

377
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,600
You really are considerate.

378
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:20,000
Look at this. The bear cookies really are quite adorable.

379
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,600
- This is probably Yuwei's father, right? 
 - Yeah.

380
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,800
- First time meeting. 
 - Hi, everyone. 
 - Hello.

381
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,600
Hello.

382
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:30,000
Miao Miao's mother, he also went to SJTU.

383
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,800
He and Miao Miao's grandmother are schoolmates.

384
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:39,400
I'm from the class of '04. What about her?

385
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,100
My mother went to Cornell.

386
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,200
I remembered incorrectly.

387
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,100
But I guess my grandfather could be considered a part of SJTU.

388
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,800
May I ask? What was his major?

389
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:58,600
He wasn't a student. He was one of the board of directors of the school.

390
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,300
That's so admirable.

391
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,800
You don't even know what my grandfather's name was.

392
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,000
What would you be admiring?

393
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,080
Before we were talking about decorating the place,

394
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,900
I can't manage it myself.

395
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,000
- The party? 
 - Yeah.

396
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
What place are you guys decorating?

397
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,300
- Next month, we want to host an "I Love Mom" party.
 - That's great.

398
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:25,800
We want to make the party a bit fashionable, but we don't have enough people.

399
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,500
- I can help! 
 - Really? 
 - Yes.

400
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:32,400
- That would be great— 
 - We should talk about it a little more.

401
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,400
We'll meet up again then.

402
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,800
Sounds good.

403
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,200
We'll discuss it later.

404
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,740
The children are out!

405
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,000
They're out.

406
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,900
 Where's Miao Miao? 

407
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:03,100
 [@Everyone, lets have a meeting tomorrow afternoon to discussion the party preparations, don't be late!] 

408
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:05,200
Miao Miao's mom added me as a friend again.

409
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,800
She also added me into the elite group chat.

410
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:11,600
She says that tomorrow night we're going to have a meeting to talk about the party preparations.

411
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,000
Is there a need to be so excited?

412
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:22,000
- She took full responsibility and used her own insurance? 
 - Yes.

413
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,300
- How is that okay? 
 - How is it not?

414
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:28,400
You already promised her before that you would take full responsibility,

415
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,700
so you should do what you say.

416
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,800
Sister Ziru took the initiative to offer to help.

417
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,000
I couldn't say no.

418
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:42,000
So you are at ease with letting her shoulder the burden

419
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,200
of next year's loss of insurance rebate and of the risk of fraud by herself.

420
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:55,500
Besides, we're not related to her in any way.

421
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:59,300
We'd owe her such a huge favor. Does this really seem right to you?

422
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,600
It's so much money though.

423
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,600
How many TVs would I have to sell to make it all back?

424
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,500
Siyu,

425
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:16,070
didn't I tell you?

426
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:19,400
I can pay this off for you.

427
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,200
Your money doesn't grow on trees either.

428
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,000
You worked hard for it.

429
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,500
But at least it will give me peace of mind.

430
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,200
It's so much money!

431
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,700
I suggest we focus more on...

432
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:01,000
- Let me take this call. 
 - ...the technology behind batteries.

433
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:09,300
- Hello? 
 - Sister Ziru, do you have time tomorrow?

434
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,200
What's going on, Siyu?

435
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,300
I want to treat you to a meal.

436
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:16,900
I think I should pay for the car's repair.

437
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:21,000
I'll take you up on the meal offer, but let's not talk about the car repair anymore.

438
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,800
Do you have time tomorrow?

439
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,800
Sure. Once you've made the reservation just send me the address.

440
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,300
It's a deal. I'll see you tomorrow.

441
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,200
Your annual salary isn't that high.

442
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,400
Why do you think you can make back this money in one year?

443
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,400
I'm amazing.

444
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,200
I... I have a plan.

445
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,700
I have a plan to get the company to give me a raise.

446
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,900
Then I wish you a smooth promotion and salary raise.

447
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,900
Thanks.

448
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,600
Go with me tomorrow.

449
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,000
Sure.

450
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,800
[You are here]

451
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,500
[I am here]

452
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,200
[This is Shanghai]

453
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,300
[Work hard for your dream]

454
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,900
She said she's willing to accompany me.

455
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,600
People even break contracts that are written on paper.

456
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,400
This is just an oral promise.

457
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,900
Li Siyu wouldn't do such a thing.

458
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,900
Then let me ask you. When you wanted to divide the team today,

459
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:52,100
why didn't she agree?

460
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,000
 This time I will be running beside you. 

461
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,600
Sit down.

462
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,300
Siyu, take a look at this.

463
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:07,000
These are the names of everyone in our Sales Department.

464
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,700
Pick some.

465
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:11,100
I'm picking?

466
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,400
If you're going to be the Team Two's leader, then you need to have people in your team.

467
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,200
Besides the people who have always been with you,

468
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:19,400
Xia Xiaotian, Liu Xiaojia, look at some others.

469
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,600
These people have always

470
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,000
been with me, so they will stay with me.

471
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,300
- This one, this one.
- Sister Yuan, the company says that the decision must be mutual.

472
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,600
Isn't it a bit inappropriate for us two to already select people here?

473
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,500
Just let them make their own choice.

474
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:39,600
Wouldn't that just create a mess? What if they all pick to be on my team?

475
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,200
Or all pick to be in your team?

476
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,100
First of all, they probably wouldn't pick me.

477
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:46,400
There's always a first-come, first-served process.

478
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:50,600
If your team is full, then even if someone wanted to get in, they can't.

479
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,800
- Good morning, GM Pan. 
 - Good morning, GM Pan.

480
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,200
- Good morning, GM Pan. 
 - Good morning, GM Pan.

481
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,200
- Good morning, GM Pan. 
 - Good work.

482
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,600
- Good morning, Sister Siyu. 
 - Good morning.

483
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,700
- Good morning. 
 - Good morning.

484
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:25,000
Sis, Lin Ling asked if our team still has room for more people.

485
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,500
She says she wants to join our team.

486
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,000
Lin Ling?

487
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,200
- One of the three goddesses? 
 - That's right.

488
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,900
- Didn't Sister Yuan kick her out? 
 - Yes.

489
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:37,200
Sister Yuan stipulated that anyone who doesn't perform well for three consecutive months would be automatically fired,

490
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,600
but now the sales department has completely changed.

491
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,500
I think that if you're willing to take her in,

492
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:45,800
she can at least intern for three more months.

493
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,800
Forget about it. She can't do anything,

494
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,800
why would I want her?

495
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,600
All right then, I'll tell her.

496
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:59,800
Oh right!  The Administration Department has set up a new office for you. It's over there.

497
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,600
Really?

498
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,700
- Good morning, Sister Siyu. 
 - Morning.

499
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,500
How is it?

500
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:35,120
Sister Siyu, the Administration Department has said

501
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:38,410
that if you're unsatisfied by anything, just tell them and they will change it.

502
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:43,990
Sister Yuan's here, I'll head back out first.

503
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:47,550
- Sister Yuan. 
 - Hey.

504
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:54,850
- Sister Yuan. 
 - How is it going?

505
00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:58,880
Is everything organized? If you are missing anything, just tell me. I have everything.

506
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,680
No need. The Admin Department has already help me with everything.

507
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,210
- Are you better? 
 - Much better.

508
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:07,190
Do you have to get an infusion today? I can go with you after work.

509
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:10,670
There's no need, I'm going to the hospital for a check-up in a bit.

510
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:14,990
But there's a client in Ningbo

511
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:17,760
that wanted me to go discuss the contract.

512
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,520
Can you make a trip for me?

513
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,470
There is just one last step to close the deal so I won't be at ease sending someone else.

514
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:26,430
No problem! Leave it to me, I guarantee I'll bring back a signed contract.

515
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:29,650
Thank you. I've already had Ziting book a 10:00 a.m. bus.

516
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:31,360
Okay.

517
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,310
Is there anything else?

518
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:37,040
No, nothing else.

519
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:40,080
I'll get going.

520
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,710
 We just brought a...

521
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:15,850
- After you graduated from university, have you only worked at one company, Caijin, this whole time? 
 - Yes.

522
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:18,210
I'm a pretty nostalgic person.

523
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:21,300
Director Chen,

524
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,200
you're Haowen's friend so I consider you a friend.

525
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,230
Then I'll just say it how it is.

526
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:30,790
The best time to change jobs in the workplace is three to five years.

527
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:32,880
I think your time is a bit too long.

528
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,110
You've worked for ten years at one company and never left.

529
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:38,830
I wouldn't dare to recommend you to my clients. They wouldn't want you.

530
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:44,820
Don't businesses need employees who are very loyal?

531
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:47,520
Yes, loyalty is very important.

532
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,060
Employees who change companies once a year aren't acceptable.

533
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:53,690
But to develop a business, you need energetic people.

534
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:02,460
Then, asides from the number of years at a job, what else are they looking for?

535
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:04,670
Right now on the job market, the ones who are most desired

536
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:07,280
are either the young ones with new ideas,

537
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,870
or the ones who can bring benefits to the business.

538
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:13,350
Typically those are directors or higher ranked.

539
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:18,580
Combining your age and your position at your old company,

540
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:22,470
it's honestly a bit awkward since you are average.

541
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:27,550
- Please don't mind. I'm a pretty direct person. 
 - It's fine.

542
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,430
It doesn't mean that you won't find anything.

543
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:34,850
It's just that your salary might not be up to your expectations.

544
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:41,310
Then how much do you think I should ask for?

545
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,450
¥200,000?

546
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:48,810
- For an annual salary?
 - Yes.

547
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,850
That's far from what I expected.

548
00:39:57,850 --> 00:40:00,460
That's how the market is like right now.

549
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:22,170
- Hello? 
 - Yiming. Hurry and congratulate me.

550
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:25,290
 - What's up?  
 - I just closed another deal.

551
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:28,130
That's great. Congratulations.

552
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:32,230
- Are you not at the company? 
 - I-I am.

553
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:35,170
Does your company play such sad music?

554
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:39,540
I'm at... the coffee shop near my company. I h-h-had an appointment with my client.

555
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:41,690
Are you working overtime tonight?

556
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:44,100
Don't forget, we made dinner plans with Sister Ziru.

557
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,090
I'm going to the subway station right now.

558
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:48,760
I'll get back to Shanghai later in the afternoon.

559
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:51,800
I need to go to the company to finish something. Then I'm done.

560
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:56,260
- Did you have a business trip again? 
 - Yup.

561
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:58,110
I'm in Ningbo.

562
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:02,410
Why do I remember that you don't have clients in Ningbo?

563
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:05,410
Sister Yuan's client. I'm just here to help.

564
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:09,130
Sister Yuan needs your help?

565
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:11,500
She couldn't leave.

566
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,980
Why aren't you saying anything?

567
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,890
I didn't.

568
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:25,200
What did you not do?

569
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,680
Is it because I didn't tell you beforehand?

570
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:35,110
No.

571
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:38,790
Can we not be like this?

572
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:41,510
I just had last-minute plans and didn't have the time to tell you.

573
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:43,650
It only takes a few hours to go back and forth.

574
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:46,150
- I'm really fine. 
 - All right then,

575
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:48,050
I'm hanging up.

576
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,520
- Sister Siyu your back? 
 - Yeah.

577
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:12,310
Sister Siyu, Vice President Hu is looking for you.

578
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:15,490
He wants you to go to Human Resources once you get back.

579
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,670
- Give it to me. 
 - Help me put it in my office.

580
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:20,350
Thank you.

581
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:30,170
Come in.

582
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:34,290
Please sit.

583
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,940
Please choose people for Team Two.

584
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:41,150
I'm choosing? Isn't it a two-way decision?

585
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:43,300
Just take a look at the list of names first.

 [List of Personnel in the Sales Department] 

587
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:51,770
- Is this the entire Sales Department? 
 - No.

588
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:54,280
Sister Yuan already chose all the people for team one.

589
00:42:55,940 --> 00:43:00,580
- So these are all the people who were left over? 
 -Yes.

590
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:02,870
Then what is there for me to choose?

591
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:05,600
VP Hu, I'll be leaving.

593
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:29,000
Come in.

594
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,010
Sis, Team One's list of names has already been chosen.

595
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:36,990
- There are Huang Bibo, Kuai Zi, A'Fu Zhou Zhiyu, Yang Tian and Zhang Jiaqi— 
 - I know already.

596
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:43,180
I heard that after we left today,

597
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:46,380
Sister Yuan asked them into her office one by one to talk.

598
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:49,420
She also made all of them sign an agreement saying that they're willing to follow her.

599
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:51,410
Really?

600
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:53,610
So.. .right now, aside from you,

601
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:57,120
the top ten people in the Sales Department are all in her team.

602
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:07,540
Sis, were you the lion who was tricked to leave the mountain?
