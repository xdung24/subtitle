00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,820
[Episode 15]

4
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,660
Liu Yang! Liu Yang!

5
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:55,260
- Liu Yang! What are you doing? 
 - Going home.

6
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,590
The party hasn't ended yet!

7
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,070
I didn't study abroad in America and I'm not a director.

8
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:03,270
My family are all farmers. I'm not good enough to attend such a party.

9
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,630
- I was just saying. 
 - You've gone beyond your means in order to be impressive.

10
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:10,700
If I don't say that, then people would look down on Yuwei.

11
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,900
But by saying that, where do you place me?

12
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,960
My director knows that mom. If he finds out about your boasting,

13
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,080
- then how am I supposed to face him? 
 - But I wasn't wrong.

14
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,430
You did study in America before

15
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:25,960
and you're about to be a director.

16
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,660
Zhang Zhizhi, can you please be more clear-headed?

17
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:35,170
We're not the same kind of people as them, yet you're forcing yourself to fit in.

18
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:39,320
You may not find it awkward, but I find it embarrassing.

19
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,120
Liu Yang!

20
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:56,790
The smell of the grass and soil is so nice. 

21
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,800
Come on, baby.

22
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,790
You're back?

23
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:09,070
Grandma, look at the present I got!

24
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:12,230
You got a present? Let me see.

25
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:15,050
Mom, has Liu Yang come back?

26
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:17,050
Yeah, he's in your room.

27
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:19,190
- The tail can move. 
 - Really?

28
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:21,090
Mom, please help me give Yuwei a bath.

29
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:24,240
Okay, okay. Come on.

30
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:27,980
That was 1975.

31
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:30,810
In the countryside...

32
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,540
After you left,

33
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:43,320
a teacher who taught etiquette at Buckingham Palace came.

34
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,770
He taught all of the kids royal etiquettes.

35
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:48,590
If Yuwei didn't join this social circle,

36
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,920
would she be able to learn such things?

37
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,150
Even though we're an ordinary family,

38
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:57,680
our child must surpass us.

39
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,320
We must at least teach our child to motivate herself to be better.

40
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,140
Also, let me tell you—

41
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,640
Sister Siyu, the decision on how to deal with Sister Yuan is out.

42
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,360
- What did it say? 
 - She's being removed.

43
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,750
- Sister Siyu, you're here? 
 - Your complexion is so nice today.

44
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:40,740
Watch what you are saying. When has Sister Siyu's complexion ever been bed?

45
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,480
You two have such sweet mouths.

46
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,430
Sister Siyu, let's have a party to celebrate.

47
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:49,120
- Celebrate what? 
 -  Celebrate you becoming the sales director!

48
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,250
- This hasn't even happened. 
 - It will happen sooner or later.

49
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,290
Stop, stop.

50
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:09,070
Li Siyu, congratulations.

51
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:14,090
- Sister Yuan... 
 - Not only do I want to congratulate you on the promotion,

52
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:18,340
but I also hope that the higher you climb, the harder you fall.

53
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:23,110
Don't think that just because you've got Pan Zhiyong to back you that you don't have to fear anyone or that you can step on anyone.

54
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:27,060
Let me tell you. I may not be able to punish you,

55
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:30,030
but someone will eventually punish you.

56
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:34,280
Li Siyu, wait and see.

57
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,720
There will be a day when you cry.

58
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:43,590
Go away!

59
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,880
I said, go away!

60
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,920
Go away!

61
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,330
Go away!

62
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,980
Siyu! Siyu, GM Pan is looking for you.

63
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:36,000
- Right now? 
 - Yes.

64
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,840
Hurry and come with me.

65
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:45,790
Hurry.

66
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,660
Sis, give me your purse.

67
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,440
President Pan.

68
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,090
Sit.

69
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:21,010
Next Monday, Human Resources will send out a notice

70
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:24,770
to officially announce you as the sales director.

71
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,200
I can lay the cards out onto the table for you now.

72
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:50,310
Lubao is on the brink of death.

73
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:54,170
- But haven't we always been selling well? 
 - We haven't been making money though.

74
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:55,960
Why?

75
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:00,390
A few years ago, this area had bonus policies. 
 (T/N: policies that benefit the society such as tax cuts)

76
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:02,620
Starting from last year,

77
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:06,570
the bonus policies got canceled. Our sales have been stuck at the same level.

78
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:11,560
Technology has come to a bottleneck. Our capital chain has ruptured.

79
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,110
This is Lubao's current situation.

80
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:18,920
- Weren't you guys discussing equity financing? 
 - Yes.

81
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,240
But whether it be Tianyi,

82
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,810
Hua An, or the Shanghai Bank, they all had a condition.

83
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:28,990
They said that Lubao's sales revenue must double.

84
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:31,700
- Double? 
 - Yes, double.

85
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:36,650
That means that in three months, you must bring us ¥500,000,000.

86
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,890
That's impossible!

87
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:54,670
Fifteen years ago, I told them

88
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:57,960
that I wanted to break through the American and Japanese monopolies.

89
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:02,610
I wanted China to have their own new energy enterprise. At the time, they had also said it was impossible.

90
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:06,620
- But you did it. 
 - So, there's no such thing as impossible. It just a matter of whether you will give it your all or not.

91
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:10,060
Will you go all out or not?

92
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,540
- I will. 
 - Wonderful.

93
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,800
My judgment was correct.

94
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,020
Let me tell you something else.

95
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:27,770
It's very hard. It will be excruciatingly hard, but the future will definitely be wonderful.

96
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:33,100
After we get through this obstacle, Lubao's value will be limitless. Trust me!

97
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:36,560
Within five years, Lubao will definitely join enter the stock market.

98
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,060
Within ten years, Lubao will become China's biggest monopoly.

99
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:44,190
Within fifteen years, make Lubao the number one in the world.

100
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:46,630
- I believe that. 
 - I don't believe in trust.

101
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:49,740
I only believe in giving it your all!

102
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:53,860
Give it your all with me. Lubao will definitely not let us down.

103
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:57,780
Lubao can definitely go on stage in the world's top award ceremony.

104
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,940
At that time,

105
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:06,100
we will go on stage together, representing Chinese engineering

106
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:09,820
as well as accepting the entire world's applause

107
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,730
and praise!

108
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:13,930
President Pan, don't worry!

109
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:16,800
In three months, I will make that ¥500,000,000 a reality.

110
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:28,690
Mom, later,

111
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:33,030
you and Yuwei can eat first. I'm going to wait for Liu Yang to come back.

112
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:36,340
During this time, you've worked very hard. I'm not that busy anymore.

113
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:39,230
Let me take and pick up Yuwei from early education classes.

114
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,150
Just let me go. I don't have anything to do anyways.

115
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,390
Here.

116
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:03,880
Yuwei, didn't I say that you're supposed to eat on your own?

117
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,380
Here.

118
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:10,300
When you eat, you can't play with toys.

119
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,750
After you finish eating, you can play. Okay?

120
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:17,010
When you are eating, eat properly.

121
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:21,430
If she wants to play, just let her.

122
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:26,000
Mom, it's a bad habit. We can't let her develop these bad habits.

123
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,620
Why are you crying?

124
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,760
Don't you usually baby your daughter?

125
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,370
The person who spoils her and who scolds her are both you.

126
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:37,400
Mom, loving her isn't the same as spoiling her.

127
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:42,430
I can't let her develop these bad habits. That's real love.

128
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:45,770
Look at her, you've made my granddaughter so upset.

129
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:47,730
Go away!

130
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,540
What did you say?

131
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:53,740
- Go away! 
 - Who did you learn this from?

132
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:59,510
Okay, okay, okay. Don't cry.

133
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,730
Okay, don't cry. Hurry and eat.

134
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:04,670
After you eat, you still have to go to your early education classes.

135
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:09,390
I dropped her early education class.

136
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:17,620
- What? 
 - I dropped her early education class.

137
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,960
Think about it.

138
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,880
How much does Liu Yang make each month?

139
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,800
It's not good to waste it on these things.

140
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,230
How can you call this a waste?

141
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:30,180
How isn't it a waste?

142
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:33,960
You guys say you have no money and can't afford a second child.

143
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,500
If spent less on Yuwei,

144
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,890
not only would you have a second, you could have had a third child by now.

145
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:41,680
Mom, you—

146
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,320
Eat up.

147
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:53,850
- Hello, who is this? 
 - Hello, are you Liu Yuwei's guardian?

148
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:57,850
- Yes, I am. Who are you? 
 - This is Little Talent Training Institution.

149
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:00,160
Last week you made an appointment for left-brain training,

150
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,330
but you never brought your child.

151
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:05,400
Would you like us to help you reschedule?

152
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:12,720
I'm sorry, our family is a bit busy right now. Can I schedule training for tomorrow?

153
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,220
Okay, no problem. Then I'll schedule you for 7:00 p.m. tomorrow.

154
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,320
Okay, thank you.

155
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,510
Mom, you didn't even take her to the left brain training?

156
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,200
No.

157
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:35,800
Zhizhi, don't blame me, an old person, for butting into your business.

158
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,130
Yuwei's food, clothing, and items

159
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:43,820
all suppose to be good for her brain and body. How much does all of this cost? Have you calculated it?

160
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:48,750
You are taking her to so many classes. From what I see, this family will be broke because of her.

161
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:53,190
- This isn't spending money, it's investing! 
 - What investing?

162
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:56,610
I would say that it's a waste of money.

163
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:02,100
Mom, how can you say these things in front of her?

164
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,530
What's wrong with saying that? She doesn't understand anyways.

165
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:07,920
She's already four! How can she not understand?

166
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,040
Of course, she doesn't. How smart can she be? Besides, have I said anything wrong?

167
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:16,550
It's just a waste of money. You might not care but I care.

168
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:22,320
Mom, how can you say that? She's my daughter, my and Liu Yang's daughter.

169
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,630
We earned the money. We will spend however much we are willing to on her.

170
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:29,480
Enough. You're willing?

171
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:32,920
You need to ask your conscience, how much money do you make?

172
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,150
It's my son Liu Yang who makes money to support this family!

173
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:39,360
Yes, my husband earned the money.

174
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,260
When it comes to how much we spend, I am in charge.

175
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,410
I'm his mother. He must listen to me.

176
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:48,110
In your home, he listened to you. After marrying me, he has to listen to me.

177
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,090
You don't understand anything, yet he has to listen to you?

178
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:53,340
This family is a mess because of you. I cannot live life like this.

179
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,680
It's all because Yuwei is a girl, right?

180
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,720
If she was a boy, no matter how much money we spent, it would be worth it!

181
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,630
Yes!

182
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,310
What century is it?

183
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:07,290
You are still worried about girl versus boy. You're also a woman!  How can you look down on women so much?

184
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,900
Don't talk to me about that.

185
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:14,270
In broad daylight, all you know is how to yell.

186
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,980
Don't eat anymore.

187
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,920
Mr. Liu, we'll be leaving first.

188
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,670
- Mr. Liu, see you tomorrow. 
 - See you tomorrow

189
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:01,150
- Hello? 
 - Hello, Liu Yang.

190
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:03,750
Can you get off work on time to come home today?

191
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,580
What's the matter?

192
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,350
I can't get along with your mom anymore.

193
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:11,660
We just fought.

194
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:15,260
- What happened? 
 - You'll know once you get back.

195
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,560
Yuwei doesn't listen to me anymore.

196
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,420
Her behavior is getting worse.

197
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,190
- I thought something big happened. 
 - Is this considered something small?

198
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:30,840
This is your daughter. Bad habits from childhood

199
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,520
will last a lifetime.

200
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,950
 You don't even know what your mom said in front of Yuwei.

201
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:39,040
In front of Yuwei, she said that I waste money on Yuwei.

202
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,840
Enough, enough!  Don't say anymore. I'll talk to my mom.

203
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:45,780
Okay, come home early.

204
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,640
Okay, got it.

205
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,600
- Yang. 
 - Hi, Mom.

206
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:33,300
I really didn't say anything.

207
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,400
It's a fact that every month you spend a lot of money on Yuwei,

208
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,000
right?

209
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:39,250
Is it easy for me? I have to raise your kid and cook food for you guys.

210
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:42,760
I also wash clothes, I do so much work.

211
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,920
Now you guys are nitpicking me, what's this logic?

212
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,870
Mom,

213
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:48,530
I still have work to do.

214
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:51,840
Stop fighting. Can you guys do that for me?

215
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,420
Who's fighting? It's your wife.

216
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,120
All right, both of you just don't say so much.

217
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,740
I'm still busy. I'm hanging up.

218
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:32,710
Brother Yang?

219
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:34,760
You haven't gone home yet?

220
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,600
I'm just staying a bit longer.

221
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,180
Brother Yang, look!

222
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,440
What is it?

223
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,450
Where did you get it?

224
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:56,860
The last time, when I went home, I told my family that I wanted to eat small potatoes.

225
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,740
My dad sent these to me.

226
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:02,910
It's been at least 10 years since I've seen this type of small potatoes.

227
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:06,750
Brother Yang, then take this box.

228
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,940
Have Sister-in-Law cook them for you.

229
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,600
Her? She won't know how to cook them.

230
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,980
Besides, our house doesn't have a firewood stove. We wouldn't be able to create that type of flavor.

231
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:18,210
I know a place that has one.

232
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:21,400
I'll send you the location on WeChat.

233
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:42,630
[Wife]

234
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:59,560
[Wife]

235
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,760
Little Sister Yun,

236
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,540
how about we go to that place with the firewood stove you mentioned tonight?

237
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,990
Okay!

238
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:33,040
Eat it yourself, okay?

239
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:01,820
Mom, have some dinner.

240
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,360
Try it.

241
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:56,640
How is it, Brother Yang?

242
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,690
Is this the taste that you dream of?

243
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:01,840
I have finally eaten it.

244
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:18,890
You're back?

245
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,290
Do you have good news?

246
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:30,240
I've been officially appointed as the sales director.

247
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,750
Wow, that's great!

248
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:35,710
Congratulations! Cheers!

249
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,520
I booked a ticket and will leave the day after tomorrow.

250
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:54,080
I just got promoted,

251
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,900
so I can't go back with you.

252
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,690
I understand.

253
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,430
However, communications nowadays is so advanced,

254
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:07,250
we can video chat anytime, anywhere.

255
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:09,700
A long-distance relationship is nothing.

256
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,550
Moreover, to get here from where I live, it takes 2 hours when there is traffic.

257
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:17,170
So, you being in your hometown and me in Shanghai

258
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:19,650
is no different from right now.

259
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:21,670
Anyways, it's not far from here.

260
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:25,710
If we want to see each other I can get on the train for a few hours and come.

261
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:28,070
Then I can see you right away.

262
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:38,060
♫  Keep thinking that the days are long  ♫

263
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:43,140

278
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:18,430
Eat on time and take medicine on time. Don't stay up late.

279
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:22,290
Try to drink less and it's best if you don't work overtime.

280
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,550
 You have to video chat with me three times every day. 

281
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:31,260
 Each session must be at least three minutes. 

282
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:36,100
If you go on a business trip you have to tell me.

283
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:39,380
I'll send you off the day after tomorrow.

293
00:26:56,790 --> 00:27:01,220
In this next part, I would like to talk about the financialization of art investments.

294
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:04,790
There are six types of financialization of art investments.

295
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:07,180
Art mortgages,

296
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:09,270
art pledges, art loans,

297
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:12,920
art trusts, art funds, and art stocks.

298
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:17,460
The last time is art appreciation.

299
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:20,670
But first, we need to clarify a concept.

300
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,530
Why aren't you inside?

301
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:32,130
Don't you think his lecture is really boring?

302
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:35,600
Old Liu's lectures have always been like that.

303
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,660
He is the best at talking about something interesting in a very boring manner.

304
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,870
He is not only boring but also forgetful.

305
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:43,770
The assignment he gave us two weeks ago was given to us again last week.

306
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:45,850
That's nothing.

307
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:49,540
Last week, I repaid him the money I borrowed yet he asked for it again yesterday.

308
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:52,840
I heard someone say he's very stingy.

309
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:56,790
I heard when he was in his third year of university,

310
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:59,210
he treated a classmate to roujiamo 
 (T/N: meat in flatbread that's a popular street snack.)

311
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:01,110
and even now he's asking to be paid back.

312
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:02,890
Ridiculous.

313
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,640
Do you want some?

314
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,870
Are you also my classmate?

315
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:12,160
How come I haven't seen you before?

316
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:15,410
I don't come often.

317
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:18,050
It looks like you skip class often, too.

318
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,800
It's about time to go in.

319
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,850
- Go in now? 
 - I have experience in this.

320
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:32,760
If we go in now and then ask a question before class is over,

321
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,810
then he won't realize we skipped class.

322
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:38,790
You're a veteran at this.

323
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,470
Follow this veteran.

324
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:02,680
Okay, we will discuss it up to here for today's class.

325
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:06,950
I'd like everyone to read some books I recommend.

326
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:10,110
Then write a book review of no less than 3,000 characters.

327
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:13,030
Email it to me before the next class.

328
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:14,830
Do you understand?

329
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,720
Okay, class is over.

330
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,780
I'm going to go ask a question.

331
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:32,370
Professor Liu, for the two important aspects of art investment, I didn't really understand it.

332
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:36,210
- Can you teach it to me again? 
 - I just talked about that.

333
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:41,260
One: artwork has become an important part of financial management.

334
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:46,200
Two: artwork has become involved in credit rating and pricing for companies and individuals.

335
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,040
So...

336
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:52,120
- When did you get here? 
 - Just now.

337
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:55,110
- Are you finished? If you're finished then let's go. 
 - Okay. Do you have any more questions?

338
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:58,450
- No. 
 - Wait for me, I have to get my things together.

339
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:01,530
How are we doing things today? Going dutch?

340
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:04,220
If we're going dutch then you should pay,

341
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:07,020
since you haven't paid me back for the roujiamo from our third year of university yet.

342
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:12,020
Don't speak nonsense, everyone is waiting.

343
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:16,750
It's not nonsense, you're a big boss now so shouldn't you treat me to a meal?

344
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,400
Let's go. Where are we going?

345
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,170
- Today, we definitely have to go dutch. 
 - Hey!

346
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:31,830
Everyone pays for themselves.

347
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:38,510
- Are you looking for me? 
 - I think she's looking for me.

348
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:40,330
Professor Liu.

349
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:43,260
Oh.

350
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:56,260
Are you one of Professor Liu's classmates?

351
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:58,680
Then, why didn't you tell me just now?

352
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:03,090
- Are you very afraid I'll tell him what you said? 
 - I'm not afraid.

353
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:06,260
If you give me your WeChat,

354
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,440
then I won't sell you out.

355
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:27,410
Okay.

356
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:32,110
If I invite you out and you don't come, then I'll still rat you out.

357
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:35,780
- That's blackmail. 
 - Bye.

358
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,390
Hello, I'm from Lubao Group.

359
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:04,200
Lubao Group's Sales Director, Li Siyu.

360
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:07,470
This is Lubao's pre-approved documents.

361
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:09,710
Okay, wait a moment while I register it.

362
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:11,930
Thank you.

363
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:16,380
Brother Yang, I've submitted the pre-approved documents on behalf of Lubao.

364
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:19,880
Someone with the surname Wu accepted it. 
 Got it. 

365
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,360
 Please take care of us. 

366
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:36,050
 Siyu, are you free to have a drink tonight?

367
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,210
Sure.

368
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:50,650
[Yiming]

369
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,430
[I'll send you off the day after tomorrow.]

370
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:25,070
Xiao Wei, go ask Old Wu if he has collected all the documents from each company yet.

371
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:26,920
Okay.

372
00:34:30,930 --> 00:34:33,290
I saw you barely eating anything in the canteen these days.

373
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:35,220
Is your stomach acting up again?

374
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:37,320
Yes.

375
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,320
You are an adult, yet you don't even know how to take care of yourself.

376
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:07,460
Take care of these boxes for me.

377
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,410
Just these?

378
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,710
Yep, just these.

379
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:18,810
What else do you want to entrust me with?

380
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:20,430
There's nothing else.

381
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:23,210
Then, you and Li Siyu...

382
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:25,080
What are you planning on doing?

383
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:33,160
For the time being, we'll just be like this.

384
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:35,500
Bro,

385
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:39,220
there aren't a lot of people who have successful long-distance relationships.

386
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:42,930
But I think you two are different.

387
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:49,350
You, how do you have so much confidence in us?

388
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:52,330
Don't tell me you two had a mishap?

389
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,240
When she is with me,

390
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:04,350
I often feel I can't handle her.

391
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:07,860
Not to mention the hundreds of kilometers that will be between us.

392
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:11,230
Don't tell me Li Siyu will fly away.

393
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:14,260
No, she definitely won't.

394
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:18,860
But... I might let her down.

395
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,800
How can that be?

396
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:24,110
Once I think of

397
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:27,230
rainy days where I can't bring her an umbrella,

398
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:30,290
when she's sick and I can't get her medicine,

399
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:33,390
or even when she's sad and needs comforting,

400
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:35,690
I can only call her.

401
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:38,340
I don't feel very optimistic about our future.

402
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:43,820
Then don't go.

403
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:50,720
If I don't go,

404
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,740
then she'll be even more disappointed.

405
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:57,320
You and Siyu...

406
00:36:57,970 --> 00:37:00,060
Won't break up, right?

407
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,120
For the time being, we won't.

408
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:09,760
But who can say what will happen in a year?

409
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,970
Or after 2 years?

410
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:15,420
Who can say for sure what will happen then?

411
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,970
I won't talk with you any longer. I still haven't finished packing up at home.

412
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:24,690
I'm leaving.

413
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,410
What time tomorrow? I'll send you off.

414
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:30,340
I'm going alone. No one should send me off.

415
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:22,320
Siyu.

416
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,620
- Sister Ziru. 
 - Have you been waiting long?

417
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:25,830
- No, I just got here. 
 - Why didn't you go in?

418
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:28,160
- It's no problem 
 - Let's go.

419
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:38,710
I ran into GM Pan yesterday. He told me

420
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:42,090
that you're officially the sales director now.

421
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,780
So I was thinking that I should treat you to dinner

422
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,560
to celebrate with you.

423
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,820
Thank you, Sister Ziru.

424
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:55,450
If it wasn't for your constant support and encouragement,

425
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:58,360
I would've given up a long time ago.

426
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,790
No, you wouldn't have.

427
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:04,140
You're not a woman who gives up easily.

428
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:07,450
I just let you get to know yourself more clearly.

429
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:17,080
Sit, Siyu.

430
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:23,480
Sister Ziru, how was your discussion with GM Pan?

431
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:26,960
It was pretty good. The whole negotiation had been going smoothly.

432
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:31,050
Our President Pan is an extremely insightful and hardworking leader.

433
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:32,880
It will definitely be the right decision to collaborate with him.

434
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,960
I've felt that way already.

435
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,680
Our team is also especially outstanding.

436
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,410
Actually, GM Pan appointing you as the sales director

437
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:43,510
has brought me more confidence in Lubao's management team.

438
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:46,640
Oh right. Have you, executives,

439
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,930
met with the representatives of those two companies?

440
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:51,230
You mean Hua'an and Shanghai Bank?

441
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:53,780
- Yes. 
 - Not yet.

442
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,960
Well, maybe it's not the right time yet.

443
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,020
Eat. These are our new dishes.

444
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:02,660
- Try it. 
 - Okay.

445
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,130
Thank you.

446
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:08,880
Sister Ziru, you should eat, too.

447
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,710
How has Yiming been recently?

448
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,870
He's been pretty good.

449
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:28,750
What's wrong?

450
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:35,200
We...

451
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,050
might have to break up.

452
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:41,320
What? Why?

453
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:46,540
He left his original company

454
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:50,040
and he hasn't been able to find a suitable job this whole time.

455
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:53,080
His hometown just happened to have an opportunity.

456
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:55,360
So he's going back to try it out.

457
00:40:57,210 --> 00:40:59,980
Have you already talked about breaking up?

458
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:03,920
No.

459
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:09,430
But I have a really bad feeling.

460
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:14,690
I feel like... we'll break up sooner or later.

461
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:22,140
Your feelings surely aren't that weak.

462
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:27,100
It's been said that

463
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:31,550
the breakup rate of long-distance relationships is over 90%.

464
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:36,140
It's a critical period for Lubao right now.

465
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:38,490
As its sales director,

466
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:42,770
I must put 200% or even 300% of my efforts into work.

467
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:46,200
I don't have the time or the experience

468
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:49,100
to manage a long-distance relationship.

469
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,930
This is easy.

470
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:10,270
Easy?

471
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,650
I remember Yiming works as a planner, right?

472
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:15,630
Yes.

473
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:20,190
My company just happens to have an empty position for a planning director.

474
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:23,510
I'm not sure if Yiming would be willing to condescend for the position or not.

475
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:27,430
The annual salary should be higher than the previous one.

476
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:29,570
But it's a newly established department.

477
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:31,700
The scale is smaller.

478
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,540
Sister Ziru,

479
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:38,390
you saved my relationship.

480
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,660
Yiming!

481
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:15,520
- What's— 
 - Yiming, we don't have to be separated!

513
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:11,120
♫  Finally turned around to hug me tightly  ♫

514
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:14,640
♫  It's still that familiar you  ♫

515
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:18,040
♫  Yeah..  ♫

516
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:22,110
♫  Oh..  ♫

517
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:27,510
♫  Dear Myself  ♫

518
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:30,870
♫  Listen to the voice inside  ♫

519
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:34,850
♫  I'll give you the warm that the wind took  ♫

520
00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:37,240
♫  Hugging you, hugging me  ♫

521
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:40,660
♫   Dear Myself  ♫

522
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:44,670
♫  The sky has finally cleared  ♫

523
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:47,820
♫  We've never been so clear-headed  ♫

524
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:49,990
♫  Looking for the past me who  ♫

525
00:45:49,990 --> 00:45:53,530
♫  Ran forward without evading anything  ♫

526
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:56,910
♫  Ran forward without evading anything  ♫

527
00:45:56,910 --> 00:45:59,780
♫  Listen to the voice inside  ♫

528
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:04,500
♫  The sky has finally cleared  ♫
