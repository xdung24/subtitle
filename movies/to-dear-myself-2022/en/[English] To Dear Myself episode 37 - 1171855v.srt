00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,990
[Episode 37]

4
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:55,950
Didn't you say you guys are busy? How come I don't see anyone working?

5
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:00,740
Everyone is recuperating and building up energy. We will be very busy at the end of the year.

6
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:09,310
Who's going to create the precinct work proposal for next year?

7
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,120
Li Siyu,

8
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,480
you work on the draft for next year's work proposal.

9
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:24,270
You can use this opportunity to familiarize yourself with the work.

10
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,000
Why didn't you answer my calls?

11
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,230
You also didn't answer my calls.

12
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:51,620
You're still mad at me for what happened that day when it was raining.

13
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,290
It's not like you don't know

14
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:02,410
that I'm asleep at 10:15 p.m. every night and I turn off my phone.

15
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:06,520
That's right, your life is very organized and strict, even thunder cannot disturb it.

16
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:12,090
But you're my boyfriend! Have you thought that perhaps something unexpected could have happened to me?

17
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:14,380
Have you thought that I might be scared?

18
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:18,490
That night when the thunderstorm was happening, I was already asleep.

19
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:24,060
Moreover, we still don't know about the brain activity of humans who are asleep.

20
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:29,590
Everything you say makes logical sense, but to me there's only one explanation.

21
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:34,630
You don't care about me so you don't worry about me. I'm not important in your heart.

22
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,620
That's incorrect.

23
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,190
I already decided that you're my life partner.

24
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:44,590
That clearly indicates how important you are in my heart.

25
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:47,760
But when I need you the most, I couldn't get a hold of you.

26
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,300
I already have a solution to that problem.

27
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:57,780
I got a phone for your sake. It turns on at 10:15 p.m. every night.

28
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:01,730
At 5:30 a.m., it turns off. This is the phone number.

29
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:03,720
You're the only one who knows this number.

30
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,350
However, I want to warn you.

31
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:13,100
You can only call this number for level 5 or higher emergencies.

32
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,530
What's are level 5 or higher emergencies?

33
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:18,850
According to all of the unexpected situations that could happen in your life,

34
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:22,860
I created a chart based on each one's degree of danger and split them into levels.

35
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:27,870
That day's situation is a level 6 emergency so you could have absolutely called.

36
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,580
Okay?

37
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,780
If you don't have any questions, we can go and eat now, right?

38
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:44,420
Today's our 100th day anniversary of meeting each other.

39
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:48,050
By looking at a comprehensive ranking and the ratings from "King of Delicious Food," 
  (TN: a TV show rating food from different restaurants)

40
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:51,920
I found a restaurant that I think you'll like.

41
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:58,340
I'm pretty romantic, right?

42
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,550
Too romantic.

43
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:21,670
- Yuwei, come here! 
 - Mom!

44
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:25,330
- I'm sorry, Teacher. I've kept you from getting off work. 
 - It's fine, it's fine.

45
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:27,260
Say goodbye.

46
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,870
Sushan, bye-bye!

47
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,310
Yuwei, bye-bye!

48
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,740
Teacher Li, bye-bye!

49
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,900
Bye-bye, Yuwei!

50
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,690
We're leaving now.

51
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:36,400
Bye-bye.

52
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:45,810
It's okay. Daddy will pick you up soon.

53
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,670
You can keep playing for now.

54
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,130
Come, Yuwei.

55
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,930
- Hey! 
 - Teacher.

56
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,970
Is Sushan's mom not here yet?

57
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:08,260
Not yet. Her dad called and said that something suddenly came up so he'll be late.

58
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,370
Oh.

59
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,810
Do you have something to do?

60
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:17,420
My husband is away on a business trip, and my kid is alone at home so I'm a bit worried.

61
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:22,540
How about this? I was going to take Yuwei next door to eat.

62
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:26,820
Call Sushan's dad and if he agrees, then I can take her with me.

63
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,300
Later, we can have her dad pick her up next door.

64
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,490
That's too much to ask of you.

65
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,540
It's nothing.

66
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:34,300
Sushan, come here!

67
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:37,370
I'll call him now.

68
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:38,970
Okay?

69
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:45,040
[K Pro]

70
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,110
I'm coming to play with you!

71
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,070
Dad!

72
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:52,770
- Hey, Sushan. Have you missed me? 
 - Yes!

73
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:53,680
Give me a kiss.

74
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,700
Yuwei...

75
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,660
- It's you. 
 - What a coincidence.

76
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,780
How about I pay for this meal?

77
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:14,180
No need, I already paid.

78
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,500
Then next time.

79
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:19,570
You haven't eaten yet, right?

80
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:21,370
Not yet. I just got out of a meeting.

81
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:26,170
I ordered quite a lot. Do you want to sit and eat some?

82
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:29,840
Then I won't refuse.

83
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:32,630
Do you want anything to drink?

84
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,910
A cup of hot Americano.

85
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:37,390
If you drink coffee this late you probably won't be able to sleep later, right?

86
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,920
I still have work to take care of when I get home later.

87
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,710
So hardworking.

88
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:45,380
Who isn't hardworking nowadays?

89
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,510
I'll help you get the coffee.

90
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,500
Thank you!

91
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,630
Yuwei.

92
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:53,920
Hello!

93
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,340
Hi!

94
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,020
What are you guys doing? What are you guys building?

95
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:00,670
We are building a house for the almond.

96
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:01,820
This is a house?

97
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,370
Yes.

98
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:05,080
- Are you full? 
 - I'm full.

99
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,940
Do you want to eat some more?

100
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:11,060
Right, right, right!

101
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:14,040
Be careful! It's going to fall.

102
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,710
Mom! Sushan and I are going to the kid's zone.

103
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:20,140
Go ahead! Be careful, don't fall.

104
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,400
Slowly.

105
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,250
Thank you.

106
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,820
Yuwei's mom,

107
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:51,800
my attitude was bad before. I'm sorry.

108
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:56,190
It's fine. We are used to it as salespeople.

109
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,040
Although,...

110
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,560
Go ahead.

111
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,370
I've been confused. Our company's products are pretty good

112
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:09,300
and I've put a lot of work into the sales,

113
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,420
so why won't you even look at it?

114
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,890
Hey.

115
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:20,370
Lubao's products are pretty good, but the people at Lubao...

116
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:23,950
What did I doâ€”

117
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:26,170
Don't misunderstand. I'm not talking about you.

118
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:30,290
It's the previous salesperson.

119
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:34,340
That person didn't keep her words.

120
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,840
I felt extreme disdain.

121
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:40,450
You're talking about...?

122
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:42,970
She and I agreed to a small order before.

123
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:48,390
Later on, when my colleague was going over the contract, he found

124
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:54,910
that the contract to be signed was completely different from the contract that we confirmed before.

125
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:58,630
If we had signed that contract, my company would have lost hundreds of thousands yuan.

126
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,780
Something like that happened?

127
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,390
To my company, a few hundreds of thousands yuan is not a big deal,

128
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:09,450
but there's no way we can tolerate such vulgar tricks.

129
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:14,910
We'd rather have everything on the table so that we can discuss it. Even if you want to increase the price, it's fine.

130
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:20,450
I got into sales very late in life. You were the first customer I'd visited.

131
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm also not very aware of what happened in the past.

132
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,450
Is it possible that my sales colleague didn't do it on purpose?

133
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:31,480
That she just accidentally mixed up the numbers?

134
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:35,730
She also said that.

135
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:41,690
But I said, I can't accept this kind of behavior, so let's end the contract.

136
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:48,200
However, you don't know what she did afterward.

137
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,360
She started spreading rumors about me.

138
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,470
She said that I didn't sign the contract because I accepted some other companies' money.

139
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:57,480
So that's why I didn't sign with you guys.

140
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,200
How can she do that?

141
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,760
That's exactly what she did. Isn't that going too far?

142
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,320
Good thing my superior trusts me or else, I, Su Lixing,

143
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:12,680
would have my principles and trustworthiness ruined by one accusation.

144
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,940
That really is crossing the line.

145
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:22,830
So when you came before, you happened to encounter me when I was at my angriest.

146
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:25,140
I understand.

147
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:30,080
You are you, she is she. I shouldn't have taken my anger towards her out on you.

148
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:34,610
That was very rude of me. I apologize once again to you.

149
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,770
No, no! I should apologize to you.

150
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:42,980
As a part of Lubao, I should apologize to you for my colleague's behavior.

151
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:45,150
This has nothing to do with you.

152
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:51,910
Mr. Su, I think I should tell my manager about this,

153
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:57,860
because this not only harmed you but also Lubao.

154
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:02,090
It seems that you are quite protective of your Lubao.

155
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,260
Although there are a few rotten apples,

156
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:11,230
most of our employees and our products are very good.

157
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:16,810
Can you reconsider?

158
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:22,150
Next year. Our purchases for this year have been finalized.

159
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,490
Next year.

160
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,800
Nana!

161
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,500
May I bother you to get this year's promotional strategy, business developments, and pricing plans?

162
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,200
Tomorrow.

163
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,400
That's what you said yesterday.

164
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,600
Tomorrow then.

165
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,700
Brother Zhai.

166
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,400
What is it?

167
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,400
Did you think that by tattling on me to the boss,

168
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,900
you can sit in my position?

169
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,600
- Ignore him. It's fine. 
 - When the boss sees me, he even calls me Brother Zhai.

170
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,000
A newcomer, who doesn't understand anything,

171
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,700
is actually challenging me!

172
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,600
Is he scolding me?

173
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,500
The more you react, the worse he gets. Don't say anything.

174
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,600
What did I do to anger him?

175
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,800
The takeout is here! Who is coming to get it?

176
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,800
That one! The newcomer! You go get it!

177
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,400
Let's go, let's go! I'll treat you to a milk tea.

178
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,100
Quickly.

179
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,600
Thank you.

180
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,200
The data for the marketing channels, internet platforms,

181
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,800
and customer profiles you asked for yesterday exposed Old Zhai's tricks.

182
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,000
Old Zhai said that he's going around doing inspections, but he's actually going out to play Mahjong.

183
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,800
When Manager Feng found out, he had to take care of this by fining him.

184
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,400
That's why Old Zhai is taking his anger out on you.

185
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,600
Then, why didn't you let me argue back?

186
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,600
Old Zhai is not the type to hold grudges. As long as you let him scold you a bit, then the situation will pass.

187
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,800
If you argue back, then this little incident would escalate. How would you deal with it then?

188
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,000
In this matter, it was clearly him who was not following the rules.

189
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,100
We're not children. Not everything has to go by the rules.

190
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:22,200
I think that everyone's attitude toward me is very strange.

191
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,400
It seems as if I have offended someone.

192
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,200
That's not exactly it.

193
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,200
It's mostly because of the work proposal. Why are you so serious about it?

194
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,000
You want this and that,

195
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,800
disrupting the peace of the whole office.

196
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:38,200
But Manager Feng assigned this to me so I can't just leave it and not do anything, right?

197
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,800
Do you want everyone to be your enemy then?

198
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,800
Of course not!

199
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,600
But... I can't possibly neglect

200
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,400
the work assigned to me.

201
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,400
Then you need to

202
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,800
slowly change your personality.

203
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,600
I'll try.

204
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,300
I have the work proposal from last year. Take it, change it up a bit, and that should be good enough.

205
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:07,680
Really?

206
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:13,300
I just found out that his daughter and my daughter are good friends in kindergarten.

207
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,000
Let me take care of this.

208
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,500
Don't tell anyone else.

209
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:26,100
By the way, did Siyu's new company collapse?

210
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,200
Yes.

211
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:35,280
I tried calling her, but her phone has been off this whole time.

212
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,600
She went back to our hometown.

213
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,800
She doesn't really use her old phone number anymore.

214
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,300
What a pity.

215
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:53,400
If there's nothing else, I'll get back to work.

216
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:57,600
Zhizhi, congratualtions on winning this month's Best Improvement award.

217
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,600
Keep it up!

218
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,800
Thank you, Director Yuan.

219
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,600
I'm home!

220
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,600
You're back?

221
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,800
- It's time to eat! 
- Oh, okay.

222
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,400
You're back?

223
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,200
Did the people at work bully you?

224
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,000
How did you know?

225
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,800
I don't know, I'm just guessing.

226
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,400
Let me tell you.

227
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:01,400
Your auntie is planning to introduce a potential boyfriend to you.

228
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:05,400
Today, at home, she made a bunch of phone calls.

229
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,800
Why didn't you stop her?

230
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,000
Why should I stop her?

231
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,600
I didn't even stop you when you started dating at a young age, right?

232
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,600
You are an elder leftover woman now.

233
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,800
What reason would I have to stop her?

234
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:21,000
The one who started dating at a young age was Xiaoling, not me!

235
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Xiaoling. Hey!

236
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,400
Now that you mention it,

237
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,900
Xiaoling is better than you in this department.

238
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,000
Dad!

239
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,100
What are you two father and daughter discussing?

240
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,600
We're talking about boyfriends.

241
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,400
Since you two have already started to talk about it,

242
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,400
Siyu, I want to advise you a bit.

243
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,200
Just leave the past behind. You have gotten older so use your time wisely.

244
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,400
I know.

245
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,000
I have friends with daughters your age,

246
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
and their children have already started elementary school!

247
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,600
Even if you are in a rush to get married,

248
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:58,000
you should at least find a boyfriend, right?

249
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,800
Right, right.

250
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
That Auntie Luo is going to introduce you to one.

251
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,400
It's a young man from a design institute. His family's conditions are quite good.

252
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,000
When you have the time, go and meet him.

253
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,200
Auntie, I just started working. I'm busy. Let's talk about it later on.

254
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,000
That won't do. Each day you postpone the meeting, you get older by one more day.

255
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,200
Isn't that a bit dramatic?

256
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,400
Be a good child and do as I say.

257
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,000
Just take it as giving Auntie Luo some face.

258
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,000
Who is Auntie Luo?

259
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,800
You don't know Auntie Luo?

260
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,000
In the future, if your children want to get into good schools,

261
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,200
then you will need Auntie Luo's help.

262
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,600
[Marketing Department: Work Proposal]

263
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,800
Don't copy the whole thing directly!

264
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,600
Slightly change the numbers, incorrect words, etc.

265
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,800
[Marketing Department: Work Proposal]

266
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:28,400
I'm begging for a response, begging for a response, begging for a response, begging for a response.

267
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,600
Respond to me! I'm begging you! I'm going to go insane!

268
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,500
At least let me confirm whether you're still alive or not, Older Sister!

269
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,600
Hello!

270
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,200
What are you guys doing?

271
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:04,000
Sorry, Sister Siyu, I'm working overtime. I'll call you later.

272
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I'm also working overtime.

273
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,200
But I can still talk to you for a bit.

274
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,800
So jealous of you guys.

275
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,500
 How are you doing? 

276
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,600
Your mom has already started to help me arrange for blind dates.

277
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,400
Li Siyu, this is karma.

278
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,600
Gu Xiaoling!

279
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,600
It was your fault for telling mom about my situation with He Mu.

280
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,800
She annoyed me for three days!

281
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,200
You didn't even tell her about such a huge thing?

282
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,400
I haven't even figured it out myself, what would I tell her?

283
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,400
You're still not sure?

284
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,000
Enough, enough!  Let's not talk about me.

285
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,820
How are you?

286
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:38,800
Are you getting used to life there?

287
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,500
It's all right.

288
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:45,200
I'm okay with you coming back at any time. I still haven't put away your bed yet.

289
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,000
I'm not going back.

290
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,800
Up to you! I'm going back to work. Talk to you later!

291
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,500
Bye-bye.

292
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,400
Hi, Sushan's dad.

293
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,000
Hi, Yuwei's mom. Sorry for bothering you.

294
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,200
I... Can I ask something of you?

295
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,800
Go ahead.

296
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,600
I need to go on a business trip this weekend,

297
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:32,600
so... can you help me look after Sushan?

298
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,600
Not a problem.

299
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,600
I was going to take Yuwei to Disneyland. I can take them both.

300
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,100
That's great! That's great!

301
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,800
Sorry to bother you.

302
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,600
Not a bother at all.

303
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:47,000
Then this Saturday morning, I'll drop off Sushan at the entrance of your neighborhood, okay?

304
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
O-Okay. See you Saturday then!

305
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,800
Okay. See you Saturday. Thank you.

306
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,000
Listen up! As long as you can get the clients back,

307
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I don't care what kind of methods you use, but you cannot harm the clients' interests.

308
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,800
If anyone breaks that rule,

309
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:21,000
then Liu Jie, who was just fired, will be your example.

310
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,100
How come it feels like Sister Yuan and Sister Siyu

311
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:29,100
are becoming more and more similar?

312
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,400
The two of them are, originally, the same type of people.

313
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:47,400
The young man is very talented. He works in a big company.

314
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,200
His income is very high.

315
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,600
He's also polite and respectful toward the elderly.

316
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,000
Hey! He's here.

317
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,700
Auntie Luo.

318
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,800
Siyu is here.

319
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,800
I'm not going to stay here and ramble. The two of you talk.

320
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,200
Thank you, Auntie Luo.

321
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,600
Grasp onto this opportunity. She's great!

322
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,000
Goodbye. Goodbye.

323
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,900
Goodbye!

324
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,800
Let's talk over there.

325
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,200
Okay.

326
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,300
I'm sorry, I still have things to take care of at work. I'm leaving now.

327
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:32,400
Li Siyu, you don't remember me again?

328
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,160
X-Xiao Wen...

329
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,600
My appearance is indeed hard for people to remember.

330
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,400
That's not it.

331
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,600
I left Shanghai half a year ago.

332
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,600
You also came back from Shanghai?

333
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,400
Why did you leave?

334
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,000
I didn't like it and couldn't get used to it.

335
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,400
I... liked it a lot and was very used to it,

336
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,200
but I don't like the me when I was there.

337
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,200
What does that mean?

338
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,400
Today, I really do have things I need to do.

339
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,600
How about we meet another day?

340
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,800
Oh, okay. Another day then.

341
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:22,100
Which day is "another day"?

342
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,600
We'll figure it out later.

343
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,000
Can we exchange WeChats then?

344
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:42,020
Wen Xingyu?

345
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,400
You are the class representative of my geography class!

346
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,500
That was Zhang Xinyu.

347
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,400
I'm sorry.

348
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:58,700
It's fine. No matter where I go, I'm always the one who doesn't standout.

349
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,400
 Try it. Try it. Why wouldn't it open? 

350
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,600
Didn't you remember it? 

351
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,400
What's the ending?

352
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,400
Dad. Mom.

353
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,200
I already sent the password to you guys, why are you two still standing outside the door?

354
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,800
Your dad didn't memorize it.

355
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,000
I will take them.

356
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,200
Watch and remember it.

357
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,800
I can't believe the two of you. You didn't even tell me before coming,

358
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,200
I could've gone to the train station to pick you guys up.

359
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,200
We didn't want to bother you, so we didn't tell you beforehand.

360
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,400
We know the address so we just took a cab here ourselves.

361
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,600
Son, you don't live here?

362
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,800
I've been working overtime lately.

363
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,400
This is the house you bought with 5 million yuan?

364
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,000
Yes.

365
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,600
In our hometown, you could've bought two villas with that kind of money.

366
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,800
Dad, this is Shanghai!

367
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:49,800
Yiming, Shanghai's housing prices aren't going to fall, are they?

368
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,500
How could Shanghai's housing prices possibly go down?

369
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:07,390
Is this house okay?

370
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,600
I called your company,

371
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,000
and the people said that you quit a long time ago.

372
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,200
Why?

373
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,000
Do you have a job right now?

374
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
I do have one. My friend and I started a business together.

375
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,200
Will the business last?

376
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,600
Yes, of course, it will.

377
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:30,600
We have also found people to invest in it. The company is also operating steadily now.

378
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:34,600
Then... is there no way you and Siyu can get back together?

379
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,200
We came

380
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,300
to help you talk to Siyu.

381
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:44,620
I already have a new girlfriend.

382
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,600
Then, what does your new girlfriend do?

383
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,600
Finance.

384
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,200
Working in finance means that her economic conditions are pretty good.

385
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,400
Yes, they are pretty good. Better than mine anyway.

386
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,800
Where is her hometown?

387
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,400
I don't actually know.

388
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,300
How old is she?

389
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,400
It seems like... It seems like she's a bit older than I am.

390
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,200
How much older?

391
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:14,500
How am I supposed to know? I-I didn't ask that clearly.

392
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,700
You don't even know about such important details, are you being tricked by her?

393
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,800
Mom, how old am I? How would I get tricked?

394
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,800
You broke up with Siyu for her, didn't you?

395
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,200
No. Siyu and I broke up because of our own reasons.

396
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,200
It was because she lost her original job then, wasn't it?

397
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,000
I was the one who decided on the job things.

398
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,800
Let's meet her.

399
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,400
Mom, Drink some hot water.

400
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:09,100
- Be careful, it's hot. 
 - We want to meet your girlfriend.

401
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
There's no need, is there?

402
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,400
Yes, there is.

403
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,800
The two of you came too hastily, how about next timeâ€”?

404
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,800
This time.

405
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:27,500
All right. I'll see when she has some free time then.

406
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,800
Dad, Auntie, I'm back.

407
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,600
Siyu, have you eaten?

408
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,400
Not yet.

409
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,400
Sit down.

410
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,000
How do you feel?

411
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,800
Do you even need to ask?

412
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,200
She came back without even eating, there's clearly no feelings.

413
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,600
I didn't ask you. I asked Siyu.

414
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,000
No feelings.

415
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Such good conditions yet you have no feelings?

416
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,200
What conditions?

417
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,200
Auntie Luo said

418
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,100
that before coming back from Shanghai, he sold a house there.

419
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,800
It must be worth a few million yuan!

420
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,200
Are you going sell my daughter for a few million yuan?

421
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:24,200
Even if we must sell her, she's worth at least hundreds of million yuan, right?

422
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,400
Don't listen to your dad. Listen to me.

423
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,600
Get along with Xiao Wen well.

424
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,000
Let's forget about it.

425
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
We can't forget about it.

426
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,200
You need to marry someone in this lifetime, right? You're already over 30 years old.

427
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,600
This is your last chance.

428
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,400
Why would you say that?

429
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,200
Right now, your worth is starting to go down.

430
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,800
Young lads in their 30s are very popular.

431
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,800
They are just starting to further their careers.

432
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,600
Auntie, what kind of reasoning is that?

433
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,700
It's for your own good.

434
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:01,220
Listen to me. Don't lose him, okay?

435
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,000
Let's talk about it later.

436
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,800
This is too urgent. There's not enough time.

437
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:13,200
I need to increase Lubao's value by tenfold before the end of the year.

438
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,600
I contacted a few companies. They all know it's difficult and backed out.

439
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:24,600
[Mom: Your dad made a table full of dishes but you didn't come back once again.]

440
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,200
What's up? 
 [I had things to do today,]

441
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,600
Nothing. 
 [I will definitely go back to spend time with you guys tomorrow evening.]

442
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,800
Yiming, I need to change the situation of

443
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,900
Lubao's ineffective marketing planning urgently.

444
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,000
Let me think and see if I have any friends to recommend to you.

445
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,700
You can recommend Yiwen Company.

446
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,620
I can't comply with your wish.

447
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,200
Do you want some more soup? I'll help you go get it.

448
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,000
Let the auntie go do it.

449
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,600
No need. I can do it. I'll do it.

450
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,900
[Mom: Can we meet that girlfriend of yours tomorrow evening?]

451
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,000
Here.

452
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:10,920
My parents are here.

453
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,100
Oh.

454
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,100
They want to meet you.

455
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,660
What are you laughing about?

456
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,300
I just suddenly feel

457
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:36,350
like everything is so realistic.

458
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,800
Could it be that our relationship is not real?

459
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,400
That's not what I meant.

460
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,000
I was saying

461
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:51,000
I suddenly feel like I'm nearing the daily trifles of a family life.

462
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:03,800
Tomorrow, I might have to go on a business trip.

463
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:11,060
You decided to go on a business trip just now, didn't you?

464
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,500
Do you think

465
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:19,820
that it's not the right time to meet them right now?

466
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:25,000
I think that there's no need.

467
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,300
Do you think there's no need for that right now,

468
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,300
or do you think there's no need for that ever?

469
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,600
Our relationship is between the two of us.

470
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,200
It has nothing to do with other people.

471
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,000
T-They aren't some just other people.

472
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,200
They are my parents.

473
00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:46,020
Yiming,

474
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:52,000
these past few days, you've been using "working overtime" as an excuse to not come back.

475
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,280
Did you think I wouldn't have any thoughts about that?

476
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:03,160
But I didn't ask, right?

477
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:09,400
Because I believe in your loyalty to our relationship.

478
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:13,200
I also allow you to have your privacy,

479
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:18,520
so I hope that you are like that, too. That you can respect my beliefs.

480
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:24,110
I only love you. I only want a relationship with you.

481
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,400
Then, what do you think

482
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:33,200
the final destination of our relationship will be?

483
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:37,190
I haven't thought about that yet.

484
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:41,320
You haven't thought about our future?

485
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,700
We are very happy together right now.

486
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,400
Why think so much?

487
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,600
What I want isn't just the happiness we have right now.

488
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,600
What else do you want?

489
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:55,200
Even though we just got together,

490
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:58,600
I want responsibility,

491
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:02,900
protection, and a lifetime.

492
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,100
I might not be able to give all of that to you.

493
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:19,080
Can I understand it like this?

494
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,800
You actually just want to date me,

495
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,800
but you do not want to participate in my life

496
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,200
nor let me participate in your life.

497
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,100
Yiming. Yiming!

498
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,600
You said that I'm your angel,

499
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,600
but did you know

500
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:55,000
that the failure rate of an angel's investment is 95%?

501
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,600
I said that I don't want to be a part of too much

502
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:04,800
because if one day, I must face failure,

503
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,400
then I can just be accountable to myself.

504
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,400
I won't have to be accountable to anyone else.

505
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,800
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

506
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,600
You are not allowed to go back on your move!

507
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,800
I'm your father!

508
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,400
That's still not okay.

509
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:52,300
Why are you so serious about playing Chinese chess?

510
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,700
It's your turn.

511
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,000
What is wrong with the two of you? The phone is ringing yet you two don't answer it.

512
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Don't bother us. Don't bother us.

513
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,200
Hello? Who is it?

514
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,100
It's Xiao Wen?

515
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:09,200
Okay, okay. She has time.

516
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,400
Pick her up right now, all right?

517
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,800
Okay, okay.

518
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,600
Bye, okay?

519
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,800
Who was it?

520
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,200
It was Xiao Wen.

521
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,800
He's asking you out.

522
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,200
I don't want to go.

523
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,200
I promised him. He'll be here soon.

524
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,000
I have to play Chinese chess with Dad.

525
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
What's the fun in playing chess with your dad? He always goes back on his moves.

526
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
You're the one who does that.

527
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,800
Good girl. Go change.

528
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,600
Good girl.

529
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,300
Listen to me.

530
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,800
Look who's here.

531
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,000
Yuwei!

532
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,800
Sushan!

533
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,100
Good morning.

534
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,300
Come. Come to where your dad is.

535
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,200
Are you coming here to pick her up tonight?

536
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,800
My business trip was pushed to next week.

537
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,400
I promised Sushan that she'd get to go to Disney,

538
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,000
and I don't want her to be disappointed.

539
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,200
So... I'll go with you guys.

540
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,400
Sure!

541
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,800
Get in the car.

542
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,500
- We're going to Disney! 
 - Let's go!

543
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,000
Pass him.

544
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:33,000
When driving, safety is the most important.

545
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,100
I'm driving. We must drive safely.

546
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,900
What did you say?

547
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:52,000
My plan is that in 3-5 years, once I have children,

548
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,800
I'll switch the car to a station wagon.

549
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:57,500
It would be more convenient to take the kids out on vacations.

550
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,200
You've thought very far ahead.

551
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,800
Three to five years isn't considered far ahead, is it?

552
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,200
Days go by very quickly.

553
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:18,800
-  â™ª Two tigers love to dance,  â™ª 
 -  â™ª Two tigers love to dance, â™ª

554

 -  â™ª The rabbits obediently pull the carrots â™ª

  -  â™ª We are little ducks learning to walk â™ª

556
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,700
Hey, look. The tallest building there is Shanghai Center.

557
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:34,000
- That one? 
 - Shanghai Center?

558
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,600
The second tallest one is the International Financial Center.

559
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:41,400
- International Financial Center? 
 - That's right!

560
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,800
Next to it is a slightly shorter building.

561
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,000
It's Jinmao Tower.

562
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,700
- Jinmao Tower. 
 - Jinmao Tower.

563
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,800
That's right! So smart.

564
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,200
Little duck.

565
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,800
Duck? Where is there a duck?

566
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,800
That's a swan.

567
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,000
Dad, look.

568
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,800
I know the story of the ugly duckling!

569
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:07,000
Please tell it to me, I'm begging you.

570
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,400
Okay, I will tell it to you.

571
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,800
A long, long time ago,

572
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:15,800
there was a female duck.

573
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,800
Why did you bring me here?

574
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:26,400
This is the marriage house that my parents got for me.

575
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,200
It's been fully paid for.

576
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,800
The money for construction has also been set aside. We're just waiting on the woman to decide on the design.

577
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,100
The two of us haven't gotten to this point yet, have we?

578
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,200
That's true.

579
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:39,800
I just wanted to use this way to show you that I'm not one of those unreliable people.

580
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,500
I want to head towards marriage with you.

581
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:46,400
If we get married, you don't need to worry about our finances.

582
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,800
By the way, my family has two shops in Jingye Plaza.

583
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,300
My mom said that the rent from those two shops is all for our kids in the future.

584
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:57,000
We no longer need to worry about the landlord increasing the rent.

585
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,800
We don't need to worry about the landlord selling the house anymore.

586
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,800
From now on, we are slaves to the house mortgage.

587
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,600
We have finally become house salves!

588
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:16,500
I... have had a crush on you since the first year of middle school.

589
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,800
What did you say?

590
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:26,200
Oh. Last time, when we met and I found out that you were still single,

591
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:30,500
I impatiently asked Auntie Luo to introduce you to me.

592
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,600
So that's what happened...

593
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,000
Siyu,

594
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:52,400
even though you don't say anything, I can feel

595
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,000
that in Shanghai, you definitely got hurt.

596
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,800
I can promise you

597
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,800
that as long as you are with me,

598
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:04,100
I will never let you get hurt.

599
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,600
Do you know why people get hurt?

600
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,800
Because they met bad people.

601
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:16,100
No. It's because love hurts people.

602
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:21,410
If you don't want to be hurt, then the only way is to have no love at all.

603
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
But can we do that?

604
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,200
I cannot.

605
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,000
I cannot either.

606
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:34,200
So, as long as we have the ability to love,

607
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,800
then we must face pain.

608
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,700
I keep feeling a sense of foreboding.

609
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:46,260
Xiao Wen,

610
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,170
let's just be normal friends.

611
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:51,710
Are you sure?

612
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:53,480
Absolutely sure.

613
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:59,800
Being with you doesn't make me feel tired

614
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,800
and I won't get hurt,

615
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:04,300
but...

616
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,400
I think...

617
00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:11,190
You think it's tedious, right?

618
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:19,500
How about the two of us interact a little more? Maybe you'll be able to find that feeling.

619
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:22,600
Xiao Wen.

620
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:27,600
You have great conditions. Everyone has advised me to cherish you,

621
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:30,200
but...

622
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:34,400
you are not what I want.

623
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,400
Then what is it that you want?

624
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:45,600
I still want the feeling of love,

625
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,800
even if I get hurt again.
