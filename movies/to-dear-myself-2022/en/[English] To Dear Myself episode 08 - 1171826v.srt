00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,020
[Episode 8]

4
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,680
Director Wang,

5
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,160
is this the bidding document you made?

6
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,330
Yes, it is.

7
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:58,160
Have you checked it?

8
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:02,000
President Lu, I received it this morning.

9
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,620
I quickly went through it. I didn't read it carefully.

10
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:08,010
Now read it carefully.

11
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:10,700
The 4th line of the 3rd page of the annex.

12
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,170
Sorry, President Lu.

13
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:28,830
I stayed up too much so I reversed these two groups of numbers.

14
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:31,660
Also, the 1st line of the 5th page.

15
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:38,640
President Lu, I left it out.

16
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,450
I just turned to some random pages, and I had already found some mistakes.

17
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:45,840
Sorry, President Lu.

18
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,290
The depth and quality of the bidding document,

19
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:55,690
directly relate to the result of the invitation for bids this time.

20
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:59,180
This also reflects the management of one organization.

21
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,050
The document you made...

22
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:06,590
is ruining our reputation!

23
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:10,360
President Lu, sorry. This was also my mistake.

24
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:15,080
We will check and rectify it immediately.

25
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:19,310
Xiao Liu,

26
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:23,760
you said "stay up" just now.  Did you blame me for not giving you enough time?

27
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,510
I didn't. The time is enough. It's the problem of my time management.

28
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:31,210
Now I give you two more weeks' time.

29
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,400
If you still can't make it well,

30
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,580
then I'll give this assignment to someone else.

31
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:41,680
President Lu!

32
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,720
What's wrong with you?

33
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:52,390
This is okay. This is okay.

34
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:55,830
These all work.

35
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,230
- This—
- Old Wu.

36
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:00,330
One minute.

37
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,580
What's up, Brother?

38
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,850
You see, here...

39
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,070
and here.

40
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:14,150
And here. What's the problem?

41
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,150
Wei Yayun?

42
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:20,970
Come here!

43
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,710
Quick!

44
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:31,670
Tell Mr. Liu... How did you do your work?

45
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,460
You did this?

46
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,510
Yes.

47
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,620
Do you not know common sense?

48
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:45,020
Here. Compared with the previous document,

49
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,910
it's just rearranged a little. You wrote it like this?

50
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,640
Also here.

51
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,790
You don't understand? Or you didn't care?

52
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,450
Mr. Liu, sorry for my negligence.

53
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:06,910
Because of your negligence, we didn't reach the standard of the document.

54
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:09,410
You wasted Mr. Liu's time as well.

55
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,850
What are you thinking about all day long?

56
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:15,270
You want to become a regular staff by working like this?

57
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,370
- I think you should— 
- All right.

58
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,150
Go back to your work.

59
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:26,870
No young people work hard now.

60
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:29,450
I thought this part of the job was easy.

61
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:33,460
I also wanted to give her an opportunity, so I gave the job to her. I didn't expect this.

62
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,160
Sorry, Brother. I will change it immediately. Next time, I won't—

63
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,510
No need. I will do it by myself.

64
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:43,200
You don't trust me, do you?

65
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,230
Old Wu, I'm busy here. Let's talk about it later.

66
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,970
Then...

67
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:51,440
Then let's talk about it later.

68
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:08,070
When the kids finished lining up after school,

69
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:10,320
Doudou pushed Miao Miao again.

70
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,600
- He almost pushed Miao Miao again. 
 - Really?

71
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,060
He also pushed my William.

72
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,840
Yes, he also teased my Little Xingxing.

73
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:20,600
Do you think Doudou has ADHD?

74
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,460
Yes. Don't you think that we should call on the school

75
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,680
not to allow a sick kid to stay in the class?

76
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,280
Then, how should we do it?

77
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:34,360
But is it discrimination if we do it like this?

78
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,410
Doudou almost bullied all the kids in the class.

79
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:41,030
If the parents don't care and the teacher can't manage him well,

80
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:44,200
then shouldn't we think of a solution by ourselves?

81
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,510
Then, you say how could we call on this?

82
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,810
How about we write a joint letter?

83
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,200
A joint letter?

84
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:58,000
Yes. Then let's find more parents to sign on the letter.

85
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,490
- This plan works. 
 - Yes, let's do in this way.

86
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:03,120
Sure.

87
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,910
Almost done, right?

88
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:07,200
Turn on the light.

89
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,410
It's so pretty.

90
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:15,340
It's beautiful!

91
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,320
- What a happy life the kids are having nowadays.
 - Exactly!

92
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,410
It's all because of an excellent mom like you!

93
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:24,450
The event looks so nice. Let's hold more like this in the future!

94
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:26,620
You picked the color very well!

95
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:32,230
Right, you see. The location is also good.

96
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:36,150
When it's a party, we need to dress up nicely!

97
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:39,430
For sure! Let me think.

98
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:44,080
My husband bought a very beautiful dress for me in Australia awhile ago. I'll wear that one.

99
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,370
I bought a new full-dress last month.

100
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:52,300
I will put on the antique dress my grandma passed to me.

101
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,140
Antique dress?

102
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:59,230
- I've never seen that. 
 - Yuwei mom, you can't wear casuals at that time.

103
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:00,770
I...

104
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:04,740
Right, Yuwei's mom. You should wear good quality clothes.

105
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,000
Yes. Look at your shoes.

106
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,930
And your bag. You need to change; otherwise, it's too humiliating.

107
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:14,150
I wear them to work.

108
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:16,820
Yuwei's mom, come and have some tea.

109
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,690
You have some first. I will finish this.

110
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:21,980
Thank you.

111
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:26,270
Which little cat hiding in the blanket?

112
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:28,830
Let me see?

113
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,180
You came back?

114
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,210
Mom!

115
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:34,100
- Yes! 
 - Finally, you came back!

116
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:37,370
- What's up? 
 - She disliked my story. We were at odds.

117
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:40,240
I want to listen to "The Little Mermaid" told by my mom.

118
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,980
- All right 
 - All right. Your mom will tell the story for you!

119
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,970
Mom will tell the story for you, okay?

120
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:46,800
Oh boy.

121
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,990
Here.

122
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:56,920
I will start now.

123
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:05,800
There were a grandma and six beautiful princesses in the deep of the bottom of the sea.

124
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,620
They don't have legs but only have fish tails.

125
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:12,630
They are mermaids.

126
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:15,720
Mermaid princesses are all very beautiful.

127
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,780
Especially the youngest one.

128
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:29,470
Yuwei, I want to ask you something.

129
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:35,970
Doudou in your class often hits other classmates?

130
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:41,590
Doudou likes to tease other classmates but he never hits people.

131
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:44,390
Has he teased you before?

132
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:50,200
He put the grass of the garden on me today.

133
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,410
What did you do then?

134
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:57,280
I just left him alone.

135
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,580
Did the teacher know this?

136
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,210
Yes, she did.

137
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:04,680
She criticized him and he apologized to me.

138
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,780
But after a while, he started again.

139
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:13,070
He went to tease Miao Miao. Miao Miao cried.

140
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:16,440
Other classmates don't like him, do they?

141
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:21,590
Sometimes they don't. Sometimes they are okay.

142
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:22,860
Why?

143
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:27,660
Because he can imitate little animals. I like to watch him.

144
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:32,970
18th Century.

145
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:34,560
Rococo. Watteau.

146
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,700
Bou...

147
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:40,190
Bou... Bou...

148
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,440
Bouchet. Flad.

149
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,960
Bouchet. F...

150
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,690
Bou...

151
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,540
Sixteenth...

152
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:06,730
The sun rose and the little mermaid

153
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:09,700
felt light and transparent.

154
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:13,000
She rose higher and higher riding a rosy cloud.

155
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,860
Higher and higher.

156
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:18,120
There is one sound from the sky.

157
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,000
Zhizhi.

158
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,560
- What's wrong, Mom? 
 - Zhizhi, drink this.

159
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,430
- What is this Mom? 
 - This is something good.

160
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:41,930
Drink it and you can have a son.

161
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:47,060
Mom, it's a little hot.

162
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,030
Put it there. I'll drink it later.

163
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:51,070
You have to drink this medicine hot.

164
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:52,980
It won't be good if it's cold.

165
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,210
- Drink it. 
 - Mom, I'm tired.

166
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:57,310
Why don't you put it there?

167
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:01,210
Why aren't you listening to me? I told you, this medicine won't work unless it's hot.

168
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:03,080
Drink it.

169
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:06,450
What's wrong?

170
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:08,570
Mom.

171
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:11,090
My bad!

172
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:13,560
What sin have I committed?

173
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:17,090
I put in a lot of effort to make Zhizhi a bowl of medicine,

174
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:19,720
but she didn't care at all about my good intentions.

175
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,130
My mom is old. Her health is not good. Why did you fight with her?

176
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:26,150
Grandma, what's wrong?

177
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:29,110
Grandma's hand got burned.

178
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:31,620
Mom, I'm sorry.

179
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:35,560
- I didn't mean it. 
 - Zhizhi.

180
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,390
Don't think of me as old and troublesome.

181
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:42,330
I'm doing this for your good.

182
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:46,170
Don't be mad. I'll drink it next time.

183
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:49,360
- I'll drink it next time. 
 - Don't wait until next time.

184
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,830
- Yang. 
 - Yes, Mom.

185
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:53,410
There is still medicine in the pot. Hurry and make a bowl

186
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:56,700
- and drink it while it's hot. 
 - Mom, this—

187
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,600
My hand is fine. Go ahead.

188
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,600
Hurry and go.

189
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:06,500
Grandma, I will blow for you.

190
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:23,310
Hurry and drink it. It's not any good cold.

191
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,320
It's late. Don't cause any trouble.

192
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,790
Drink it.

193
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,800
Who is it?

194
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:58,140
Save me.

195
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,500
Save me.

196
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,780
Gu Xiaoling, you owe us money.

197
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,470
It's time to return it, isn't that so?

198
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:10,450
When did I owe you money?

199
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:15,260
Miss Gu, we have your signature on the contract.

200
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:19,540
You guys are from Chuan Feng Company?

201
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,890
Isn't the payment supposed to be due next month?

202
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:24,140
The contract says

203
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,280
payment is due every Thursday.

204
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,310
How is that possible?

205
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:30,330
Look at it yourself.

209
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:54,070
Why is it like this?

210
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:57,220
Okay. It's already Friday.

211
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,840
According to the contract, it's already been 7 days.

212
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,540
You need to pay ¥6,600 now.

213
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,610
You are tricking me.

214
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:07,370
You are tricking me, wanting me to give you money.

215
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:13,310
Miss Gu.

216
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,580
Don't be scared.

217
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:21,690
You ought to know what the consequences are

218
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:23,660
for borrowing money and not returning it.

219
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,960
What do you guys want?

220
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,810
Hurry and return the money.

221
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:51,050
Mama, because of you, we get to eat soup dumplings.

222
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,060
Mom waited in line for half an hour this morning to buy these for you.

223
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:58,110
Thank you, Mom.

224
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:01,270
Zhizhi, drink this medicine first

225
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:03,120
and then eat breakfast.

226
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:10,030
Mom, I can't drink it anymore.

227
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,960
Why not?

228
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:15,850
I woke up three times last night. I didn't sleep well.

229
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:18,100
That's right.

230
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:21,880
Huang Shengshou said that city citizens have poison in their bodies.

231
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,310
This medicine is to help rid your body of these toxins.

232
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:26,940
Drink it while it's hot.

233
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:30,600
- Liu Yang—  
 - I have to go to work.

234
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:35,190
- This early? 
 - Something came up, I have to go in a little earlier.

235
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:37,160
- Did you finish eating? 
 - Yes, I'm done.

236
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,830
Okay. Then go, don't be late.

237
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,800
Okay, I'll be going now.

238
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,550
Yuwei, be good at school.

239
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,820
Zhizhi.

240
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:55,560
Here. Drink the medicine while it's hot.

241
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:59,310
Slowly, it's hot.

242
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,330
Mr. Liu.

243
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,410
Sit.

244
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,850
Here.

245
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:38,660
Thank you, Mr. Liu.

246
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:45,010
I was a little rough that day the other day.

247
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:47,460
Don't mind it.

248
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:51,410
No, Mr. Liu, you were right to criticize me that day.

249
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:57,270
Old Wu exaggerated this just to scare you.

250
00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:01,520
Relax. As long as you work hard

251
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,790
and don't make that kind of low-level mistake.

252
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,520
Thank you, Mr. Liu.

253
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:14,180
Don't cry.

254
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,460
Wipe your tears and eat.

255
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,220
SIster Ziru, over here!

256
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:42,430
- Why is it only you? Where is Yiming? 
 - He is busy.

257
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:45,240
Working overtime for Caijin again?

258
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,160
Think so.

259
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,530
Sister Ziru, let me report something to you.

260
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:56,470
Me and Sister Yuan have officially started to battle.

261
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:59,450
You finally followed your heart?

262
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:01,800
I was actually forced.

263
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,800
I have a question.

264
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:09,170
Is there a chance that I and Sister Yuan can go back to the way we were?

265
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,250
Of course, there's a slight possibility.

266
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:16,070
Let's go.

267
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:23,510
[Gao Zhengdao's New Battery Energy Lecture]

268
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:26,870
Some people say that membrane-less batteries

269
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:28,910
can only be used as

270
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:31,960
an object of academic interest to learn about and research.

271
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,320
However, on the market,

272
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,630
it hardly exists.

273
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:40,210
This is complete nonsense.

274
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:42,410
An extremely dumb notion.

275
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:47,850
My reason is to combine the advantages of a membrane-less energy storage system

276
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:50,660
and the chemical properties of hydrogen bromide.

277
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:54,140
If we put these two limited systems

278
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:58,870
together, we definitely will get a  better result than any single system.

279
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:00,330
His views...

280
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:02,940
are the complete opposite of GM Pan's.

281
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,800
Pan Zhiyong?

282
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,230
Don't talk.

283
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:09,590
The traditional flow cell battery

284
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:11,730
an isolating membrane,

285
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:13,400
a catalyst.

286
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,710
They occupy half of the cost.

287
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:18,690
But membranless battery,

288
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:22,270
they not only don't need isolating membranes,

289
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:25,250
but they don't need cathodal catalysts, either.

290
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:29,560
We just use a little anodal catalyst.

291
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,770
If the research is successful,

292
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:34,140
then the current market brands:

293
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,130
Beike, Deke,

294
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:39,600
and GNB, Lubao,

295
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,360
all of those will die immediately.

296
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,330
He's straight-up slandering Lubao!

297
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:48,790
If GM Pan came, they'd probably get in a huge fight.

298
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:51,430
I would honestly love to see that.

299
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,200
That's enough for today.

300
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:56,640
Professor Gao.

301
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,270
I have a question.

302
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:05,430
Sure. If the question is too stupid, I'll scold you.

303
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:09,390
You kept saying that flow cell batteries were walking to their death,

304
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:11,080
but do you know that

305
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:15,630
Lubao is going to release a flow cell battery called Lubao 3?

306
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:19,110
I heard that the Lubao 3

307
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:22,220
is ranked number one in the market.

308
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,270
We don't have a real hero at the moment, so a chap can become a hero now.

309
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:28,080
This hero you speak of... Do you mean the membrane-less battery you're researching?

310
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,580
Let me tell you. If my research succeeds,

311
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:34,880
Pan Zhiyoung's Lubao is going to be forced to kill itself.

312
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,110
So when is your research going to be successful?

313
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:40,050
When it comes time to be successful, it will be.

314
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:42,690
Mr. Gao, I have another question.

315
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:44,620
I feel like I'm playing piano to a herd of cows.

316
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:47,580
I said I didn't want to come. They wouldn't take no for an answer.

317
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:04,200
Sister Ziru, are you actually thinking about investing in his project?

318
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,350
I am a little interested.

319
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:08,900
You might as well invest in Lubao instead!

320
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,990
My company is preparing equity financing now.

321
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:14,580
GM Pan said it himself.

322
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:25,070
Sister Ziru, something happened with Xiaoling.

323
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:27,430
- I have to go over. 
 - Do you need help?

324
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:31,330
- Not now. I'm leaving now. 
 - Hurry and go.

325
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,660
Professor Gao!

326
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:40,160
Professor Gao!

327
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:42,740
Professor Gao!

328
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,280
Professor Gao, the objects on the market right now,

329
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,920
are basically all updated versions of old research.

330
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,680
Your research is not like that at all.

331
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:58,120
Your research can be revolutionary.

332
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:07,960
I finally met someone who understands.

333
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,880
Can I please take a look at your lab?

334
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:14,880
You lead me.

335
00:26:55,160 --> 00:27:00,150
Professor Gao, how much more money do you need for your research?

336
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:04,440
¥20,000,000. If I had ¥20,000,000, I could make breakthroughs.

337
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:07,930
¥20,000,000...

338
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:13,190
¥20,000,000 isn't that much.

339
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:15,380
I can come up with the money.

340
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:19,250
Okay.

341
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:21,140
But you have to tell the school.

342
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:25,060
This donation is made specifically for my lab.

343
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:30,810
I want to join in the form of investing.

344
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:34,980
That works, too.

345
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:39,020
Then you have to also talk with the school.

346
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:43,330
What if I only want to talk with you?

347
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:45,630
What does that mean?

348
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,660
I want...

349
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:52,690
to set up a company for you.

350
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:55,130
You want me to leave the school?

351
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,940
Professor Gao, with my knowledge,

352
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:04,790
the school has been cutting your funds for some time now.

353
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:08,780
There has even been word that some people want to close your lab down altogether.

354
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,460
You seem to know a lot about my situation.

355
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:16,750
The school has regarded your research as pointless for a while now.

356
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:18,720
I trust that if the price was right,

357
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,650
they would be willing to give up your research results.

358
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:24,860
And then...

359
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:27,560
And then you can work in your very own lab

360
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,530
with no limits.

361
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:32,340
You never have to worry about funds ever again.

362
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,910
There's definitely a catch.

363
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:39,270
I just want to have some shares within your company.

364
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,690
- How much? 
 - 60%

365
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:50,470
¥20,000,000?

366
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:54,420
For ¥20,000,000, you want 60% of my shares?

367
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:01,170
Professor Gao,

368
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:05,280
usually, angel-like investments don't go past 30%,

369
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:09,920
and they even require that in five years, they get five times the amount in return.

370
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:12,930
But in my current state, that's impossible.

371
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:14,630
Yeah.

372
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:18,600
You can't even guarantee that you'll have a breakthrough with ¥20,000,000, can you?

373
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:27,480
Professor Gao, the industry trusts your research even less.

374
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:31,880
More than 50% of people think you are poles apart.

375
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,950
Over 90% of people,

376
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:36,210
think that you cannot be successful.

377
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:39,040
The most trusted science magazine predicts that

378
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:42,580
if membrane-less batteries want to successfully enter the market,

379
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:45,400
then there still needs to be 20 years.

380
00:29:57,150 --> 00:30:00,720
Then, why are you looking for me?

381
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,660
I am an investor.

382
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:06,450
I understand the risks much differently than other people do.

383
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:09,980
I won't accept 60%.

384
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:15,130
60% does seem high.

385
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:16,840
But don't forget.

386
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:20,690
I am putting myself at a 99% risk.

387
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,200
You can leave now.

388
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:32,000
Professor Gao, I'm telling you.

389
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,340
I trust that not a single person

390
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:36,820
will take this much money and time

391
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:42,330
- to invest in a project that has a 99% chance to fail. 
 - I need to go to work now!

392
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:46,000
Work.

393
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:52,550
Okay.

394
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:55,060
This is my business card.

395
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:58,010
If you change your mind, please contact me.

396
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,320
I'll put it here.

397
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:06,930
I'll leave.

398
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:13,020
[Wang Ziru] 
 [Chief Executive Officer]

399
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:16,810
[I'm Gu Xiaoling. I can't pay back my debt. So I'm willing to have sex with you. ¥300 per night. The price is negotiable if you are introduced by friends. I'm driven desperate now. Please help me.]

400
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,490
Don't cry. Talk.

401
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:29,400
Say something.

402
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:39,180
I needed money,

403
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:42,900
so I found a company and borrowed ¥100,000.

404
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,690
If you needed money, why didn't you come to me?

405
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:51,650
You helped me return ¥130,000 just recently. I couldn't just ask for more.

406
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:53,560
And then?

407
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:56,480
I said I'd borrow ¥100,000,

408
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,940
and return ¥140,000 in two years, ¥6,000 a month.

409
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:04,710
I don't know how it became six thousand a week.

410
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:06,940
How is that possible?

411
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:11,990
When I signed the contract, I didn't look very carefully at what it said.

412
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:15,010
It's such an important thing, how could you not pay attention?

413
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:18,720
The contract was so thick, how was I supposed to read it all?

414
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,800
Then you deserve it!

415
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:28,240
Sister Siyu, don't scold Xiaoling. She's already upset enough as is.

416
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:37,220
They came asking for money yesterday.

417
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:40,470
I didn't have it, so they...

418
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:47,630
Everyone in my contact list got this message. How am I supposed to face them?

419
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,600
Who are you guys looking for?

420
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:09,400
Ms. Gu, you've got friends over? That's perfect.

421
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,200
So, can you return the money today?

422
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,600
I can't return it.

423
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,400
Get your friends to let you borrow some then.

424
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,000
If you send a message like that, who would possibly want to help me?

425
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,400
Wow. You're quite stubborn.

426
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:24,200
Let me tell you. If you can't return it today, I've got an even bigger trick up my sleeve.

427
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,400
Why are you so rude?

428
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,800
We're trying to solve Ms. Gu's problem.

429
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,800
Not scare them.

430
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:37,400
Ms. Gu, if you really can't return it, I'll help you.

431
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,800
You can get another company and borrow money from them.

432
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,200
Return ours first.

433
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,000
You're full of tricks.

434
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,800
You definitely can't.

435
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,400
Then you help her return it.

436
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,400
Exactly! It's a total of ¥106,000.

437
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,000
Get the money.

438
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:57,400
Ms. Gu, you already know our methods.

439
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,800
I even came up with a plan for you.

440
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,600
The rest is up to you.

441
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,800
Let's go.

442
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,100
We will come back tomorrow.

443
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:14,000
You guys purposefully tricked Gu Xiaoling in the contract. She's an idiot and doesn't understand, so that's on her,

444
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
but running into her house smashing and breaking everything is wrong.

445
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
What do you want to do?

446
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:26,600
Right now. I'm about to report you for violent robbery and debt collection.

447
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,000
I'm going to kill you.

448
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,600
If I add assault and battery, you'll be stuck in jail for ten years at least. If that doesn't happen, then my last name isn't Li!

449
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,800
Miss, that would be framing us.

450
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,400
Yes. I am framing you.

451
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,400
You think you're the only two gangsters on this earth?

452
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,000
Zhizhi, call the police!

453
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,400
Don't move! Who dares to move?

454
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,200
Xiaoling, go to the window and scream for help.

455
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,600
Don't move. Get over here.

456
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,200
Help! Help!

457
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,000
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

458
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:54,800
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

459
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,400
We were too rash.

460
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,700
We'll apologize. Okay?

461
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,600
Miss, we're also doing this for business.

462
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,600
Why would you put us in such a place?

463
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:13,100
If Ms. Gu is willing to return the money, then everything will be fine.

464
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:17,800
We will definitely pay back the money including the interest by this week.

465
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:22,000
You guys must apologize and immediately send a text to help Xiaoling regain her reputation,

466
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,200
and promise to never bother her again.

467
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,400
But...

468
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,000
There is nothing to discuss.

469
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,800
Okay.

470
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,400
Sorry.

471
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,700
Send the message.

472
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,500
I will, I will.

473
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:46,800
You, clean up the mess you made.

474
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,400
- I.. You... 
 - Xiao Wu, just do it.

475
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,800
Okay.

476
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
[I talked nonsense today. I apologize to Ms. Gu.]

477
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,800
Get lost.

478
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:35,000
Sister Siyu, you're so formidable.

479
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:58,200
Siyu... thank you.

480
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:04,400
Why would you borrow so much money?

481
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,400
I signed up for a seminar that cost ¥100,000 as tuition.

482
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,200
To learn what?

483
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:13,400
Art appreciation and management.

484
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,200
Are you crazy?

485
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:21,200
I'm not crazy. It was a clearheaded decision.

486
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,000
Our club has started group buying, and the people who come are getting worse and worse.

487
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I need to change groups.

488
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,000
I don't think you need to change groups, you need to change brains!

489
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,600
What's wrong?

490
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,200
You already suffered so much from Lan Ke, why didn't you learn from that?

491
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,000
How come all you think about is shortcuts?

492
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
What do you mean shortcuts?

493
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,800
Besides, shortcuts are made for people to walk on!

494
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,000
Why can't it be me?

495
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,400
You need to have the skill to walk a shortcut! What skill do you have?

496
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,000
Do you think rich people are all idiots?

497
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
You think you can do whatever you want just because you're pretty?

498
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Siyu, don't act like you're allowed to lecture me just because you helped me return the money.

499
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,200
Not only did I help you return the money,

500
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:59,000
but I also helped you return your debt! I have the right to lecture you.

501
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
I don't need you to return it for me!

502
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,600
That's what you said.

503
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:05,200
From today on, even if I die on the street, I still won't ask you to help me!

504
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,600
From today on, anyone who ever helps you again is sick in the head!

505
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,200
Sister Siyu!

506
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,700
Zhizhi, don't stop her.

507
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,600
Xiaoling.

508
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,400
Xiaoling.

509
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,700
Take a look.

510
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,400
Siyu just gave me ¥110,000.

511
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,800
She told me to give it to you.

512
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:33,000
She said you should hurry and return it to those people.

513
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:45,000
Siyu was just saying that stuff. In her heart, she still loves you.

514
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:09,220
Li Siyu,

515
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:14,800
don't you dare think that just because you helped me, I'll bow down to you.

516
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,200
I will definitely return ten times the amount back to you.

517
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:21,700
But I never want to see you again.

518
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:25,600
I made you a wonderful dinner.

519
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:34,400
I'm too tired today. I'll go see you some other day.

♫  It's been so long, I've already learned to let go  ♫

527
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:01,000
♫  Let go of obsessions, of the present, and of greed  ♫

528
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:06,000
♫  Yet I've never thought of letting you go  ♫

529
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,200
♫  Yeah…  ♫

530
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:12,200
♫  Oh…  ♫

531
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,200
♫  En…  ♫

532
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,600
♫  Letting go…  ♫

533
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:19,000
♫  Dear Myself  ♫

534
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
♫  Listen to the voice inside  ♫

535
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,800
♫  In this lonely world, be cautious ♫

536
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,600
 After we're hurt, we learn to cherish  ♫

537
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:31,800
♫  Dear Myself  ♫

538
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:35,200
♫  Use all your strength  ♫

539
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:39,400
♫  Missing the simple you from the past  ♫

540
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,600
♫  Turn difficulties into courage  ♫

541
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:45,600
♫  Don't back down from the crowd  ♫

542
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,800
♫  Growth is inevitably accompanied by setbacks  ♫

543
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,600
♫  The best way to overcome difficulties is to smile  ♫

544
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,600
♫  All the punishment given by fate, are you afraid?  ♫

545
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:56,000
♫  Let everything go, all those concerns, real or fake  ♫

546
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
♫  Cannot erase the scar, but it's just a scar  ♫

547
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,600
♫  We are so small yet so determined  ♫

548
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,400
♫  Occasionally fussy and occasionally firm  ♫

549
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,600
♫  If growth leaves a trace, then the trace is left be tears  ♫

550
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:08,600
♫  Your back that I've always been chasing  ♫

551
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:12,000
♫  Finally turned around to hug me tightly  ♫

552
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,500
♫  It's still that familiar you  ♫

553
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:17,800
♫  Yeah..  ♫

554
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:21,800
♫  Oh...  ♫

555
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,800
♫  Oh... ♫

556
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:27,200
♫  Dear Myself  ♫

557
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:30,400
♫  Listen to the voice inside  ♫

558
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:34,400
♫  I'll give you the warm that the wind took  ♫

559
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,000
♫  Hugging you, hugging me  ♫

560
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,200
♫   Dear Myself  ♫

561
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:44,200
♫  The sky has finally cleared  ♫

562
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:47,600
♫  We've never been so clear-headed  ♫

563
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:49,800
♫  Looking for the past me who  ♫

564
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:53,200
♫  Ran forward without evading anything  ♫

565
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:56,400
♫  Ran forward without evading anything  ♫

566
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,800
♫  Listen to the voice inside  ♫

567
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:03,900
♫  The sky has finally cleared  ♫
