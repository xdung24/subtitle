[Episode 41]

4
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,130
He Mu, do you love me?

5
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:46,880
I feel a bit unwell today so I'm going home to rest now.

6
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:57,580
We welcome you to come next time!

[Share your location.]

9
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,150
Lixing, where is the soy sauce?

10
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:47,030
In the cupboard. Look for it yourself.

11
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,160
Lixing,

12
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,590
are there bigger bowls?

13
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,560
See for yourself.

14
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:46,420
Stop working, we're having dinner soon.

15
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,010
Time to eat!

16
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:58,940
It's ready?

17
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:02,420
Come on, Sushan, let's eat.

18
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,450
You are hungry, right?

19
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:10,180
Okay. Let's go and eat.

20
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:13,460
Here.

21
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,600
Sit tight, okay?

22
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,520
Wait a minute. Haven't I told you that

23
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:24,180
you need to wipe your hands clean before dinner? Otherwise, there will be germs. Did you forget?

24
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,950
Here. Let me wipe them for you, okay?

25
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,600
The other one.

26
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,370
All right, they are clean now. Eat.

27
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:39,400
Here, I just made some dishes with whatever I could find. Try the noodles.

28
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,030
How is it?

29
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:46,200
These are the best tasting noodles I've ever had!

30
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,050
- Really? 
 - Right?

31
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:50,580
Best tasting? Then eat more, okay?

32
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,540
You should try it, too.

33
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,050
This is the life I want the most.

34
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:08,200
I work hard out there while you stay home to take care of the house chores and children.

35
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:14,470
Every day, when I come home, I can see Sushan's adorable smile,

36
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:16,780
and there will be a hot bowl of noodles to eat.

37
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,770
Tomorrow's the weekend, yes?

38
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:26,120
You don't have any plans, right?

39
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,790
If you don't,

40
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:32,100
then help me take Sushan to training class in the morning.

41
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,260
I have some things to take care of at work.

42
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,900
I'll probably be at the company all day.

43
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,300
Okay.

44
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:44,650
The cleaning lady will also come in the afternoon. You should come and take a look.

45
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:54,380
Also, kids are usually not used to the food and water in a foreign country.

46
00:05:54,380 --> 00:06:00,170
If you walk past a pharmacy, you should buy some children's medication. I'm afraid she might catch a cold or get sick.

47
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,740
Here.

48
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,870
Eat some vegetables, okay?

49
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,640
I thought you'd never talk to me again.

50
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,300
I don't want to talk to you,

51
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,140
but I can't resist the temptation of large intestines.

52
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,430
I also wanted to cut off ties with you

53
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:36,340
but then I thought about it and I can't just lose like this.

54
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,770
Then, what do you want to do?

55
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:46,340
Aren't you still not married yet? Even if you are married,

56
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:49,290
isn't there the possibility of divorce?

57
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:51,220
Even if you don't get a divorce,

58
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:55,940
if you want to have an extramarital affair, then wouldn't I still have hope?

59
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,700
Lei Haowen,

60
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:07,050
if you still want to be friends with me, then give up on those ideas right now.

61
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:10,490
Otherwise, I'll leave right now and never see you again.

62
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:12,630
Hey, hey, hey.

63
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:17,310
There's no "if," okay? Don't get angry.

64
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:19,650
Sit, sit, sit.

65
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:22,000
They're all staring.

66
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,990
Sit down.

67
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:36,570
You need to give me some time, all right?

68
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:40,490
You have to let my heart slowly die.

69
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:44,370
We can only be friends.

70
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:48,250
Friends. Let's drink.

71
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:56,280
Here. Your favorite, large intestines.

72
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,650
Lei Haowen,

73
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:21,220
if I asked to borrow ¥5,000,000 from you, would you?

74
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,800
That's with the assumption that you have that much money.

75
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,490
I'd lend it to you.

76
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:30,860
I might not be able to return it.

77
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,550
I'll still lend it to you.

78
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:34,550
Aren't you going to ask what I'm going to do with it?

79
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:36,340
Nope.

80
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,170
Aren't you afraid that I'll use it to do bad things?

81
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:40,760
Don't I know you well?

82
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,710
Thank you.

83
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:45,150
You're welcome.

84
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:51,210
With your brain, besides buying purses and clothes, what else would you possibly save for?

85
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:53,560
Hey, don't, don't! There you go again!

86
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,420
Why are you so agitated?

87
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,340
It's fine. Just a couple, a couple arguing.

88
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,060
Stop talking!

89
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:03,210
Pick up the phone. Pick up the phone.

90
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:13,880
Did you guys get into an argument?

91
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,790
None of your business.

92
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,980
Right, right. None of my business.

93
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:24,580
If you could really give me ¥5,000,000, then that would be great.

94
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,240
Why do you want that much money?

95
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:31,080
It's not me. It's Li Siyu, that prodigal woman.

96
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,800
Why does she want that much money?

97
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,930
Lately, she's been working on a project and needs investments. She's been so anxious, she's about to go crazy soon.

98
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:47,760
Why are they all blowing into our faces?

99
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:52,080
Look who's here.

100
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,340
Mommy!

101
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,070
Did you have a good time with your daddy today?

102
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:08,970
Yes!

103
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:12,560
I have something to say to you.

104
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:17,600
I happen to have something to say to you as well.

105
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:26,050
Be careful.

106
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:27,620
Okay.

107
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,670
Sister Siyu wants to start a business again.

108
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:41,500
And it's in collaboration with your lab. Is this reliable?

109
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:46,990
What do you mean by reliable?

110
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:52,220
Will the experiment be successful?

111
00:10:54,080 --> 00:11:00,090
There's... a 0.01% chance.

112
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,700
That low?

113
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,280
Then Sister Siyu is really risking too much.

114
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,150
I understand her.

115
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:19,320
The risk is worth it if you can do the thing you like.

116
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,190
This is something that you want to do as well?

117
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:25,730
Yes.

118
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:33,480
After graduating from graduate school, I wanted to continue working in research

119
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:40,100
but my rational side told me that I should get a better job.

120
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,720
That way I didn't have to worry about anything in this lifetime.

121
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,390
That's why I entered my old workplace.

122
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:50,660
You spent ten years there.

123
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:56,700
To be honest, in those ten years,

124
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,980
I had many thoughts of changing my career,

125
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:07,350
but I was afraid to start over. I just thought about it. That's it.

126
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:15,360
Then, did your wish come true now?

127
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:19,310
Of course.

128
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:25,490
Right now, even though I have a very low salary, every day is very fulfilling.

129
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:30,240
Although the experiment keeps failing,

130
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,410
but to a researcher, failing is very normal.

131
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:44,230
Then what if... in the end, you still fail?

132
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,260
What does "the end" mean?

133
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:51,110
Success is the only ending.

134
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:55,960
As long as we haven't succeeded, it is not the end.

135
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:01,040
You were never like this before. You've always wanted stability.

136
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:07,740
That's because when I was young, my living conditions weren't well. I couldn't afford to make mistakes.

137
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:12,270
So every step I took, I had to be sure.

138
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,810
However, after experiencing everything that's happened in the past two years,

139
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:18,990
I found that

140
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:21,670
life is full of unforeseen circumstances.

141
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:24,810
No matter how careful and cautious you are,

142
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:28,040
in the end, you may still fall into a pit.

143
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:34,710
So, instead of being overly cautious and indecisive, I would rather choose something I like

144
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:37,250
and put my heart and soul into it.

145
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,650
You've changed.

146
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,440
You have also changed.

147
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:54,580
In the past, we would never discuss things like this.

148
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:58,570
You never asked either.

149
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:07,220
I would have never thought that we could talk like this after getting divorced.

150
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,380
It looks like being divorced is better.

151
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,950
I've thought about it.

152
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,950
It's better if I return this to you.

153
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,560
Are you certain?

154
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:19,830
Of what?

155
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:22,210
Yuwei told me already.

156
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:36,380
Then after you go to Europe with him, will you continue to work?

157
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:45,390
His company's benefits are very good. Once we're there, I won't have to work.

158
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:57,490
Don't worry. He treats Yuwei and I very well

159
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:09,470
Zhizhi, I'm actually pretty happy.

160
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:14,450
I don't have money nor many capabilities.

161
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:20,860
If you were with me, you'd have to keep working. That would be too hard for you.

162
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:25,620
But Sushan's dad is completely different.

163
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,880
With him,

164
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:31,160
you can live without worries.

165
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,360
That's pretty good.

166
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,340
Liu Yang,

167
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:47,380
I have never looked down on the fact that you were poor.

168
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,360
I know.

169
00:16:57,030 --> 00:17:02,120
Zhizhi, you are an amazing wife.

170
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:05,390
The best wife on this Earth.

171
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,220
It is I who is not worthy of you.

 Timing & Subtitles by My Dear Myself Team @Viki.com 

173
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,360
Honestly,

174
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,170
I like working.

175
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:36,980
If you like it, then go do it.

176
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:39,470
Don't let yourself regret anything.

177
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:57,990
You should keep this. I owed it to you.

178
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:21,040
I'm back.

179
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,060
What are you doing?

180
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,770
What is going on?

181
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:38,600
I looked into it already.

182
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,590
It's better to sell these bags on Huafer. 
 (T/N: a Chinese website used to sell specifically high-quality items)

183
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:44,450
You get much more money than secondhand shops.

184
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:52,840
Xiaoling, all of these are your beloved items.

185
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:58,250
I'm most annoyed when I see you like this. Can't you just be cool about it?

186
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:03,440
Fine. After I make money, I'll buy them all back for you.

187
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,400
- You need to get more than just them for me! 
 - I'll buy you twice as many things!

188
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,220
Deal!

189
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,610
Answer the phone.

190
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:22,980
Hello?

191
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,860
Xiaoling, let's have dinner together.

192
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:29,420
Let's go to your favorite French restaurant.

193
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,760
Today is not a date night though.

194
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:36,610
Oh... One of my clients suddenly had something come up, so I have free time now.

195
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:38,920
So we can meet up.

196
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:41,140
I have a guest at my house.

197
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,730
I can't go.

198
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:47,110
Can you see if you can make time?

199
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:49,040
We didn't meet last week either.

200
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:52,530
I cannot make time. She's leaving Shanghai tomorrow.

201
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:58,320
Okay. I hope you two have fun then.

202
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,520
Did you two get into an argument?

203
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,300
It would be great if we actually argued.

204
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,390
Then what happened?

205
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:20,180
I asked to borrow money from him. Not only did he say no, but he also went off on a long lecture.

206
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:30,940
Xiaoling, in regards to lending money, people do it out of kindness but are not obligated to do it.

207
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:35,650
I think that He Mu's actions were not unreasonable.

208
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:38,900
But you're my older sister, and it was me who asked.

209
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,590
So what?

210
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:44,890
First of all, the two of you are not yet married. Second of all, even if you were married,

211
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:47,330
he still has no obligation to help me.

212
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:49,970
He's so boring. Why would I marry him?

213
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:54,090
It's because he is rich. However, now that I need money,

214
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:57,160
not only does he do nothing, but he—

215
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:00,270
Why would I get married to him?

216
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:11,590
Xiaoling, break up with He Mu.

217
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:17,230
Not because he won't lend me money but because of what you just said.

218
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:18,850
What did I just say?

219
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:22,430
You were going to marry him for money.

220
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:24,100
What's wrong with that?

221
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,980
There's nothing wrong with that.

222
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:30,320
However, a happy marriage comes from love, not from money.

223
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,830
You still believe in love?

224
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,200
I've always believed in it.

225
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,560
You and Chen Yiming loved each other so much, but you two still broke up, didn't you?

226
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:45,070
Chen Yiming and I broke up because we didn't love each other enough.

227
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:48,930
The two of you were engaged yet you two didn't love each other enough?

228
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:55,540
Perhaps our love was just enough to get engaged.

229
00:21:56,330 --> 00:22:00,580
Now that I think about it, when two people are truly together,

230
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:03,590
they need to sacrifice bits of themselves,

231
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:08,660
and, more importantly, they must be brave enough to face life's pressures.

232
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:12,470
But I wasn't ready for any of that.

233
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:16,520
When did you figure all of these things out?

234
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:22,970
After Laidianle failed.

235
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:30,360
On that day, I looked at myself in the mirror.

236
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:37,410
I was anxious, impetuous, and paranoid.

237
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:42,670
I wanted instant success and was defiant.

238
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:48,360
Even I loathed that woman.

239
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,840
What right do I have to ask someone else to love me?

240
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,870
Then, what about now?

241
00:22:54,970 --> 00:23:01,030
Now... Don't you think I'm very cute?

242
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:07,050
Then...

243
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:10,940
If another person appears in your life, how would you love him?

244
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:18,360
I definitely would still put my heart and soul into loving him.

245
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:23,090
You have already "hit a wall causing your head to bleed",  yet you still don't know to change. (T/N: already been brutally hurt once before by someone who does not reciprocate) 

246
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:25,990
Since my head already bled, then it's even more important that I don't change.

247
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:31,240
What if I hit the wall a few more times and it falls? Then I win!

248
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,270
I hope you will be happy.

249
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,430
Xiaoling, I also wish that you will be happy.

250
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:41,220
Don't marry someone because of money.

251
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:44,080
If you only have love, then you will starve to death.

252
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,110
If you only have love then you will starve to death!

253
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:48,080
Let go.

254
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,680
I can't communicate with you.

255
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,510
Hurry and think about what else we can sell.

256
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:05,330
Hey, take a look at my purse, how much do you think it's worth?

257
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:06,380
Maybe a bit over ¥1,000?

258
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,330
Then let's sell it.

259
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,480
How did I forget about Guan Xiaotang?

260
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,490
Look at the female superhero I made.

261
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:28,720
That's awesome.

262
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,200
Let's have her sit here, all right?

263
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,900
Zhizhi,

264
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:39,250
I'm sorry. I wasn't able to keep you.

265
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,540
Director Yuan, you already did your best.

266
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:59,110
To tell you the truth, Lubao is not the same as before.

267
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:03,160
Even I don't know how long I'll be able to stay there.

268
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:10,100
Hey, how old is Yuwei this year?

269
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,550
She's five.

270
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:18,470
When I got divorced, Meng Meng was also five years old.

271
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:26,950
Director Yuan, can I ask you a personal question?

272
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:28,500
Go ahead.

273
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:35,260
Raising Meng Meng alone, was it very hard?

274
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:37,750
Of course.

275
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:44,630
Did you ever think about reconciling with Meng Meng's dad

276
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:47,130
or find someone else to marry?

277
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:54,550
Do you think that two people spending their days together would definitely be easier than spending your days alone?

278
00:25:55,580 --> 00:26:00,040
For normal people like us, nothing is easy.

279
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,510
Since life is difficult anyways,

280
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:07,140
then let's pick the thing that gives us the best reward.

281
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:10,750
What gives the best rewards?

282
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,900
A stronger self, of course.

283
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,220
A stronger self?

284
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,690
Yes.

285
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:26,510
All these years, raising Meng Meng alone, I had faced many hardships.

286
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:30,810
I had neither support nor a way out.

287
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:33,520
I had to face everything and carry all the burden myself.

288
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,660
Over time,

289
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:38,850
I had gotten myself several ailments.

290
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,610
My reputation also became bad,

291
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:46,900
but I gained skills as well as courage.

292
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:51,230
Things that belong to me, no one can take these assets away from me.

293
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,150
Yes.

294
00:26:57,150 --> 00:27:03,310
Before getting a divorce, I never would've thought I could be a saleswoman.

295
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,230
After divorcing, I have become one of the backbones of the sales department.

296
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:10,750
Speaking of that,

297
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:14,540
Director Yuan, a toast to you. Thank you for taking me in.

298
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,340
No need to thank me.

299
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:19,870
I was so harsh to you in the past. As long as you don't hold a grudge towards me, it's fine.

300
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:28,960
Then I need to thank you even more. Good thing you pressured me then; otherwise, the person I am today would not exist.

301
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,790
If you must thank someone, thank yourself.

302
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:34,320
The you today didn't come about because of me, but because of yourself.

303
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:39,590
Thank you, and thank you, to my dear self.

304
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:45,980
Remember, we can lose anything but ourselves.

305
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:48,200
I will remember.

306
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,710
Cheers.

307
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:59,560
You two, are you full?

308
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,000
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

309
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,220
Do you want to eat some more?

310
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,250
- No need. 
 - Thank you.

311
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:07,370
You don't want more?

312
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,280
Xiaotang! Do you still want this computer? If not, I'm taking it away.

313
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,850
Take it. If you like the computer desk chair, you can have that as well.

314
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:18,910
Thank you!

315
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:23,620
Xiaotang, I will take the water machine!

316
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,530
 Xiaotang, I'm taking these two lights! 

317
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:27,470
 Take it. Take it. 

318
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:39,230
If you want something, just take it.

319
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:48,050
Your company collapsed faster than Laidianle.

320
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:53,070
Wow! My goodness! Older sister! I want to kiss and hug—

321
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:54,900
Hug and hold you up high.

322
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,330
Don't move.

323
00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:58,000
I won't, I won't.

324
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:02,400
Older Sister, why are you here? Did you miss me?

325
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,820
Oh! You've been enlightened.

326
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:07,920
You want to suddenly start dating.

327
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,720
What's happening here?

328
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:15,180
It just flopped.

329
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:18,040
Oh, right, Older Sister!  If you want anything, you can take it.

330
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:22,760
However,...I think the best thing for you to take is me.

331
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,990
Out of everything here, you are worth the least.

332
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:27,620
Why are you so bad at recognizing product value?

333
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,260
I came here for business.

334
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,010
You-You go ahead.

335
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:33,450
How much money do you still have?

336
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:37,330
I... don't have cash. Let me see.

337
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:42,850
I still have ¥73 in my Alipay account. Oh, I also have a card.

338
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:48,230
This card has a limit of ¥500,000,

339
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:50,790
but I think there's only ¥3 left.

340
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:55,100
This... I think this one still has ¥30.

341
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:57,830
This has been frozen.

342
00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:00,030
This is useless, too.

343
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:05,320
Oh right, on Wechat, I-I-I still have 30 something yuan.

344
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:09,140
Wh-Why so little?

345
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:12,640
I've always been poor, it's not like you don't know.

346
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,300
What about your car?

347
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,460
I mortgaged it to my friend.

348
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:18,470
It was worth over ¥1,000,000!

349
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:24,220
Look around. Starting a company "burns money." It's not like you haven't done it before.

350
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:26,060
If I had known earlier...

351
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:30,620
- W-W-What's wrong, Older Sister? Are you in need of money? 
 - Yes.

352
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,990
How much do you need?

353
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:33,620
¥5,000,000.

354
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,390
That's nothing.

355
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:37,690
You're already like this yet you are saying "that's nothing"?

356
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:40,160
Even though I don't have money, Old Guan does.

357
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,320
- Your dad? 
 - Yeah.

358
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:46,540
Oh, right! We can get him to invest in this project!

359
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,490
I've got this.

360
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,980
Hey, Guan Xiaotang.

361
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:56,870
Let me be clear. This is just business, nothing else is involved.

362
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:02,490
Oh! You're afraid that I would use money to blackmail you into h—

363
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:04,210
Shut up!

364
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:06,200
It's fine. That won't happen. Impossible!

365
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,890
At most, I'd just use the money to blackmail you into being my girlfriend, I would never use it to m—

366
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:10,630
- Shut up! 
 - But we're—

367
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:12,940
If you keep talking, I'll hit you.

368
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:15,130
Hit me, hit me, hit me!

369
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:18,650
Hit me! Hit me! I don't believe it. What are you doing?!

370
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:19,960
- Broom! 
 - Broom?

371
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,990
The broom is over there!

372
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:25,920
Broom. I— hey, do I need to take my pants off before you hit me?

373
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:30,210
Wait, wait. First, hit my butt. I need to call my dad.

374
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:32,110
Don't always be hitting my face.

375
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:38,710
- It's fine. You can hit me. 
 - Hello, the number you have dialed cannot be connected to right now. Sorry. 

376
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:41,410
I'll call Sister Meiying then.

377
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:45,280
Hit me. It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

378
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,760
If you don't hit me, then I—

379
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,330
Hello, Sister Meiying.

380
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:50,870
Um, where's my dad?

381
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:54,890
Oh. Okay, I got it.

382
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,210
Are you hitting me or not? I've been lying here for so long! Are you going to or not?

383
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:03,260
If you aren't, then let's go.

384
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,150
Where to?

385
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:11,390
To ask Old Guan for money! Let's go! Look how happy you are.

386
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:13,020
Let go!

387
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:39,170
As long as your father is willing to give me 30 minutes, I'm confident I can persuade him into investing.

388
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:44,150
It's not that bothersome. Just tell him that it will surely generate money. Then he'll definitely invest.

389
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:46,620
I really can't guarantee that.

390
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,140
That's fine, too.

391
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:52,760
Isn't it just ¥5,000,000? If he doesn't lose it on you, then it'll just be lost on someone else.

392
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,350
Does your dad often lose his money?

393
00:32:56,020 --> 00:33:00,110
In this past year, that seems to happen a lot.

394
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:01,640
It's upstairs.

395
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:17,610
- Hey, Sister Meiying. 
 - How come you're here?

396
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:19,450
I have an urgent matter to talk to my dad about.

397
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:22,900
Oh, he's treating people to a meal inside.

398
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,630
Let me bring this wine in first.

399
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:28,750
Hey. How much has he drunk already?

400
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:32,360
There are four people. They've already had four bottles. This is the fifth.

401
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,960
Oh... Then hurry and bring it to them.

402
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,800
- Sit. 
 - Okay.

403
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:42,000
I understand his alcohol tolerance. If we let him have one more bottle, your investment will be a done deal.

404
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,450
Here.

405
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,320
The wine is here. The wine is here

406
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,700
 Great. 

407
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:52,230
- More wine? 
 - Having wine with you makes me happy.

408
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:55,530
 Old Guan, your stomach is in bad shape. 

409
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:57,990
If you keep drinking, your stomach will bleed again.

410
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:00,150
Being able to drink with you,

411
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:01,610
 even if my stomach bleeds...

412
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:05,690
Your dad also has a stomach ailment and can't drink wine?

413
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:07,970
He has a stomach ailment?

414
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:10,720
I-I didn't know.

415
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:16,620
Older Brother, I shall drink first as a sign of respect.

416
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:19,390
Director Wang, you must drink some more today.

417
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:22,120
Not bad, right?

418
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:26,140
 Um, in regards to the loan from the bank, 

419
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:30,330
- I would like to bother you to help me with that. 
 - Old Guan.

420
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:32,130
It's not that I don't want to help you,

421
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:36,470
but this matter really won't be approved by the company.

422
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:39,310
You and the company should make some arrangements.

423
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:41,950
That's right, Old Brother. We must trouble you for this.

424
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:43,510
 All right? 

425
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:51,000
How about you repay the ¥30,000,000 from before first?

426
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,200
Then I can approve the ¥5,000,000 for you immediately.

427
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:59,200
If you loan me this ¥5,000,000, and let me make a capital turnover,

428
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,200
 I'll surely be able to return not just the the ¥30,000,000,  

429
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,400
but also the ¥50,000,000 from before!

430
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,800
 I really cannot approve it. 

431
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,100
 Old Brother. 

432
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,400
Let me tell you the truth.

433
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,400
Right now, my company just needs one more breath of life.

434
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,600
If you let me take this one breath,

435
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,200
then I am willing to do anything.

436
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:23,800
I really can't. I really can't loan you this ¥5,000,000.

437
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:27,600
T-Then... just ¥3,000,000 then!

438
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,600
¥2,000,000!

439
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,800
As long as you can loan me this sum of money,

440
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,600
then my company will survive!

441
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,600
Older Brother, I'm begging you.

442
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,000
 During these past few decades, 

443
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,200
who have I ever begged? Tell me.

444
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,800
I'll get on my knees right here, right now.

445
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,100
 - Old Guan, Old Guan, Old Guan. 
 - Old Guan.

446
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,600
Get up. Quickly get up.

447
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,200
Fine, fine. I'll promise you.

448
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,600
He promised.

449
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,000
- Get up, Old Guan, okay? 
 - Thank you, Older Brother. Thank you.

450
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,200
Thank you, Brother.

451
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,600
You really just saved my whole family's life.

452
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,400
Xiaotang.

453
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:41,600
I... I always thought that he had it easy.

454
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:45,710
The truth is, no one has an easy life.

455
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,400
My dad...

456
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:53,670
For a few million yuan, he got on his knees in front of someone.

457
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,200
Yet I still burned through his money like that.

458
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,300
I'm really— I'm really—

459
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:07,600
Even if you beat yourself to death, it would be useless.

460
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,400
Guan Xiaotang, look at me.

461
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,700
Look at me.

462
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:23,000
Guan Xiaotang, your father is going through his most difficult time right now.

463
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,600
If you want to help him,

464
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,700
go in there poised and with dignity,

465
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:30,100
to toast to all of the uncles in there.

466
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,000
You show that you're very sensible,

467
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
capable, and self-confident.

468
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
You want the uncles to see

469
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,400
that there is a successor in the family, that the company has a hope and a future.

470
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,200
That the money they loan out will be returned.

471
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:47,000
That way they will easily lend money to your dad.

472
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,400
Bu-But your situation...

473
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,700
No need to care about me. I have other ways to get what I need.

474
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,200
This.

475
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,300
This should be worth some money.

476
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,800
It should be able to help your dad.

477
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,500
Older Sister,

478
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,800
so-sorry.

479
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,700
Xiaotang,

480
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,600
if you can help your father get through this hard time,

481
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:26,300
then you would have truly matured.

482
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:33,940
By then,

483
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:37,000
would you consider me?

484
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,000
Your family is in chaos right now,

485
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
so don't be immersed into love.

486
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,400
Right now, your father needs you.

487
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,500
Hurry and go in.

488
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,600
Wipe your tears dry.

489
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Dad. Uncles.

490
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Come, come, come.

491
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
My son. Come here.

492
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,100
- How much have you drank? 
 - Say hi to Uncle Li.

493
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Where's Li Siyu?

494
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,800
She's already inside.

495
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,200
Li Siyu.

496
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,600
President Zhang.

497
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,700
The group's Sales Director position has been kept open for you this whole time.

498
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,400
None of the terms have changed.

499
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,600
Thank you for your kindness, President Zhang.

500
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:33,000
How's it going? When do you plan on reporting for work?

501
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,800
Come over here and sit.

502
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
President Zhang,

503
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,800
I came today for a different reason.

504
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:47,000
What reason? Tell me.

505
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,200
I want to borrow money from you.

506
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,800
How much?

507
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,300
¥5,000,000.

508
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,000
For what?

509
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,200
Research on membrane-less batteries.

510
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:05,200
That is... Gao Zhengdao has been researching that.

511
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,200
You know of him?

512
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,000
I've heard.

513
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
But this project...

514
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,600
doesn't seems to be progressing smoothly.

515
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,800
The prospect is not optimistic as well.

516
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,200
All of the investments have been withdrawn. Is that true?

517
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,400
That's why I came to find you.

518
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:26,800
This... You have to know

519
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,300
that no one is optimistic about this project.

520
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:34,200
If everyone did, then I'd have no chance.

521
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,600
President Zhang. ¥5,000,000.

522
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:44,000
I will borrow it for a year. After one year, I will repay you ¥5.8 million.

523
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:48,400
Then what will you use as collateral?

524
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,800
All of my assets,

525
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:57,000
including my car, were all invested into the Laidianle project.

526
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,800
I have nothing right now.

527
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,000
I don't really have anything to use as collateral.

528
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,600
If you don't have anything as collateral,

529
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:09,000
then I really cannot accept such a thing.

530
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:16,650
What if I used myself as collateral?

531
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,400
What you mean is...?

532
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,600
Haven't you always wished that I join Qiji?

533
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:28,000
Once a year has passed and I cannot repay this money,

534
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,600
then I will join Qiji Group and work for you for ten years, free of charge.

535
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:44,100
This condition you offer,...

536
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:47,600
I really can't reject it.

537
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:50,930
However,

538
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,600
I can only lend you ¥3,000,000.

539
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,300
In a year, repay me ¥4,000,000.

540
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,500
You also need to use your ten years of a labor contract as collateral.

541
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,300
Can you accept that?

542
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:07,800
Zhang Yanzhou, you old sly fox.

543
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,800
You just realized?

544
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,000
I accept.

545
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,200
Deal.

546
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,800
Deal.

547
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,500
Come in.

548
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,200
Director Su, a delivery for you.

549
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,600
Help me put it on the desk.

550
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,000
Okay.

551
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:06,000
What is this?

552
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:21,630
[I'm sorry.]

555
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:47,400
♫  How are you?  ♫

556
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:51,000
♫ Listen to me about the latest news ♫

557
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,400
♫  Some sweet and some hopeless  ♫

558
00:43:55,400 --> 00:44:00,400
♫  There are also some that were never said  ♫

559
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:04,100
♫  It's been so long, I've already learned to let go  ♫

560
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:08,600
♫  Let go of obsessions, of the present, and of greed  ♫

561
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:13,600
♫  Yet I've never thought of letting you go  ♫

562
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:17,000
♫ Yeah... ♫

563
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,000
♫ Oh... ♫

564
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,300
♫ En... ♫

565
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:23,200
♫ Learned to let go ♫

566
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,600
♫  Dear Myself  ♫

567
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:29,800
♫ Listen to the voice inside ♫

568
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:33,800
♫  In this lonely world, be cautious  ♫

569
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:36,200
♫  After we're hurt, we learn to cherish  ♫

570
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:39,600
♫  Dear Myself  ♫

571
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:42,800
♫  Use all your strength  ♫

572
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:47,000
♫  Missing the simple you from the past  ♫

573
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,200
♫  Turn difficulties into courage  ♫

574
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:54,200
♫  Don't back down from the crowd  ♫

575
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:56,300
♫  Growth is inevitably accompanied by setbacks  ♫

576
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:59,200
♫  The best way to overcome difficulties is to smile  ♫

577
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,400
♫  Are you afraid of all the punishment given by fate?  ♫

578
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,500
♫  Let everything go, all those concerns, real or fake  ♫

579
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,800
♫  Cannot erase the scar, but it's just a scar  ♫

580
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,200
♫ We are so small yet so determined ♫

581
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,000
♫  Occasionally fussy and occasionally firm  ♫

582
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,600
♫  If growth leaves a trace, then the trace is left be tears  ♫

583
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:16,400
♫  Your back that I've always been chasing  ♫

584
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,400
♫  Finally turned around to hug me tightly  ♫

585
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:22,000
♫  It's still that familiar you  ♫

586
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,400
♫ Yeah... ♫

587
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:28,600
♫ Oh... ♫

588
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:34,800
♫  Dear Myself  ♫

589
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,200
♫  Listen to the voice inside  ♫

590
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:42,200
♫  I'll give you the warmth that the wind took  ♫

591
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,600
♫  Hugging you, hugging me  ♫

592
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:47,900
♫  Dear Myself  ♫

593
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:52,000
♫  The sky has finally cleared  ♫

594
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,200
♫  We've never been so clear-headed  ♫

595
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,400
♫  Looking for the past me who  ♫

596
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:00,800
♫  Ran forward without evading anything  ♫

597
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,200
♫  Ran forward without evading anything  ♫

598
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:07,400
♫ Listen to the voice inside ♫

599
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:11,600
♫ The sky has finally cleared ♫
