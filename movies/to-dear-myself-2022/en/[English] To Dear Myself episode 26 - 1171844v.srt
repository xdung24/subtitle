00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:34,250
[Episode 26]

4
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,040
Take a look at the one in my hand right now.

5
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,170
This one is more Western style.

6
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:39,810
These outfits. Look at these.

7
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,670
Also, the ones in the back are more modern.

8
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:46,130
These are the app patterns that we designed recently.

9
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:47,920
You can take a look yourself.

10
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,760
There are Western styles and more.

11
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,800
Really, the app's style...

12
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,070
impacts the user's experience.

13
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:58,570
Right now, the flat design is getting very popular.

14
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:01,880
The flat design looks very simple and natural.

15
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,240
And then these models are a bit more modern.

16
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,430
There are also more that are more traditional style.

17
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:09,160
Take a look and see which style you like more.

18
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,740
Okay. I think I've mostly understood.

19
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,230
Okay.

20
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:23,660
If you run into any problems when you're using it, you can send me feedback.

21
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:26,720
- It depends on everyone's— 
 - Excuse me.

22
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:31,220
- Hello? 
 - Do you like western style, modern style

23
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,720
classical style, or simple style?

24
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,930
Simple style.

25
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,290
I understand.

26
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:40,060
Why are you asking me so suddenly?

27
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,420
It's a secret.

28
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:44,480
Oh, right. What are you doing right now?

29
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,270
It's a secret.

30
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,420
Let's pick a simple style then.

31
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,690
Simple style.

32
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:55,120
You can look at these ones if you like the simple style.

33
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,470
Okay.

34
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,400
- I'll order this one. 
 - Okay.

35
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,280
I booked our wedding photo shooting from "Love in Nice."

36
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,570
It's the best package. Look.

37
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:11,730
As for hotel, I booked Yuehua Hotel.

38
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:14,830
Even though it's a little farther from the city center,

39
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:17,900
it's outdoor and indoor settings are quite good.

40
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,180
For honeymoon, I chose Maldives.

41
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,220
Look. These are a few islands that the vacation planners recommended.

42
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,270
What's going on?

43
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,390
I've been pretty free recently.

44
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:37,130
I wanted to use this time to plan the wedding.

45
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:40,630
But I have more important things to do.

46
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:43,950
Are there things more important than getting married?

47
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:52,480
I want to build a shared platform for battery renting.

48
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,080
I want to do a new mobile energy service.

49
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,860
Right now?

50
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,890
This has been my desire for so many years.

51
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:05,690
Right now is the best time.

52
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,080
Tell me.

53
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:15,490
Today, there are over 300 million electric bicycles in China.

54
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:17,950
But it's always a problem to charge the bikes.

55
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:21,530
To use the platform that I build, the users only need to download an app.

56
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:26,320
They can go to any charging station in any network at any time.

57
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:31,710
It's like sharing a battery for phones, right?

58
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:36,040
Yes. But it's too small. They charge by milliampere.

59
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,190
Mine is kilowatt-hour and gigawatt-hour .

60
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:44,250
When the business of electric bicycles takes off in the market, I also want to provide service for electric cars.

61
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,600
Then it will be a revolution for the whole battery industry.

62
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:51,390
What's your advantage of doing this?

63
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:53,680
I've been working in this industry for 7 to 8 years.

64
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,860
I know almost everything about the battery industry.

65
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,890
- But you don't know about the internet at all. 
 - I can learn.

66
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:04,100
I can invite professional people to do professional things.

67
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,390
Have you thought over the profit model?

68
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:13,580
To make a profit, I need to collect users' deposits and rent.

69
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:16,290
In other cities, I can charge initial fee.

70
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:20,340
Also, as long as the platform is built, I can get investment.

71
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,130
Those shared power banks for phones,

72
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:24,760
they get over tens of millions of investment from Tianye Group.

73
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,200
What about the cost?

74
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,660
I calculated it. To start out, I probably need around four million yuan.

75
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,770
Including building the platform,

76
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:35,130
build one hundred physical branches and the money to buy the batteries.

77
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:39,830
I also contacted some battery manufacturers. They are all willing to offer me the lowest price.

78
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,490
Then what about the advertising cost?

79
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:43,250
It's included.

80
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,260
That's not enough.

81
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:48,820
As long as the platform starts to work, I can get the investment.

82
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:52,350
As long  as I can get the investment, the subsequent cost is not a problem.

83
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:55,000
Siyu.

84
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,990
Hearing you talk about this, I think

85
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,980
you made it seem too simple.

86
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:05,520
No. I know that this is going to be hard,

87
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,450
but I must do it and I must do it immediately.

88
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:18,010
I think you need to think twice

89
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,150
about this thing.

90
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:22,650
If I think twice, then someone else might snatch the opportunity.

91
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:25,070
We'll have nothing.

92
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,030
Right now, there are a lot of opportunities on the market,

93
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:30,370
but... but right now...

94
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:33,700
I want you to stop this right now.

95
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:37,260
I can't stop! I have to regain what I've lost!

96
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,880
I think we should get married first.

97
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,200
We can get married, but I have a condition.

98
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,740
What are your conditions?

99
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:02,810
I need money to start my business. Let's sell the house.

100
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:07,080
What?

101
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:11,070
Also,

102
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:13,320
I need a CEO.

103
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,430
Yiming, you should resign. We can start a business together.

104
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,570
Are you insane?

105
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:21,770
What do you mean?

106
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:31,310
Siyu, I think you need to calm down.

107
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,810
Yiming,

108
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:39,930
I need your support.

109
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,860
Siyu, I can't support you right now.

110
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,420
If you don't support me, then I will not marry you.

111
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:57,160
♫  Keep thinking that the days are long  ♫

112
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:02,170

113

Hello, are you at the company right now?

123
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:02,850
I want to talk more about the system structure with you.

124
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,620
Okay. I'll go over there.

125

133
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:13,720
♫  The memories won't let me escape  ♫

134
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,390
- GM Wang. 
 - Director Fang.

135
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,980
Come in.

136
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,520
- Hello. 
 - Hi.

137
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,170
Please have a seat.

138
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,200
In the past, I've never really had the opportunity to talk to you properly.

139
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,350
I hope, today, we can speak freely with each other

140
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:45,130
and be honest.

141
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:50,410
Director Fang, before I decided to invest in Lubao,

142
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:54,200
I looked at all of Lubao's reports from the start till now.

143
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,940
I noticed a problem.

144
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:01,180
The years that Lubao were most successful happened to be the years' GM Pan only dealt with R&D

145
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:04,720
while you did all the rest.

146
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,810
GM Wang, you overcomplimented me.

147
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:10,030
The fact that Lubao can make it today is not a miracle that was achieved alone,

148
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:12,990
it was the result of everyone's hard work.

149
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:14,610
Director Fang, you're quite humble.

150
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:16,700
I'm just telling the truth.

151
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:19,340
Starting from last year,

152
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:23,120
the policy of the country has been adjusted. This industry entered a more difficult time.

153
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,450
I noticed that Director Fang proposed the strategy of cutting expenditure.

154
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:32,000
My style is more practical.

155
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,360
I agree completely.

156
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,740
Didn't Buffett once say

157
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,980
that he wasn't trying to jump over a seven-foot fence,

158
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,250
but he was looking for a one foot

159
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,750
fence to jump over.

160
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:51,570
Director Fang, Pan Zhiyong told me that he had a plan.

161
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:55,790
He wanted to open three more Lubao3 production lines.

162
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:59,720
That's thanks to the eight billion Tianye Group invested.

163
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,220
That's what made GM Pan's ideas become reality.

164
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:05,560
I want to ask you

165
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:09,180
in the current market situation,

166
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,200
if you make your production bigger,

167
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,810
isn't that going to be a little risky?

168
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:17,080
I've discussed this problem with GM Pan.

169
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:21,290
He believes that this is a good opportunity to beat others on a curved road.

170
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:27,060
I worked for capital for so many years. I  don't see people succeed in cutting corners often.

171
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:30,900
However, many have ended up in terrible accidents.

172
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:48,150
I also want to ask GM Wang,

173
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:52,530
with your experience, what is the safest thing to do on a curved road?

174
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:56,960
Why does it have to be a curved road?

175
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,400
Why can't you just go on the airplane runway?

176
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:05,730
Airplane runway? You're talking about...

177
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:08,460
Director Fang, if I remember correctly,

178
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:12,000
Lubao's profit last year was about one billion, yes?

179
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:14,980
The cash flow of last year was too tight.

180
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:19,270
This year, with you, we hope we can go past two billion.

181
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,660
That's too little.

182
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:26,220
Within the industry, our performance is considered very outstanding.

183
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:29,850
If I was in charge, I could guarantee

184
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:34,810
that within a year, I can turn Lubao's valuation from 35 billion to 200 billion.

185
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,010
200 billion?

186
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,760
Then we'd need to make ten billion more in profit.

187
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,150
If we calculate it, the very least amount of production lines we'd need to add is ten.

188
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:48,830
- We don't need to. 
 - We don't need to add production lines?

189
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:51,480
All we need is a new packaging.

190
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,260
Director Fang, you work hard on the profit and market value

191
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,450
in order to increase your company's valuation?

192
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:01,630
Why don't you work directly on the company's valuation?

193
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:09,000
If we get Lubao's valuation to 200 billion,

194
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,140
the eight billion you invested would become forty billion.

195
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,950
The hard work of you and the rest of the executives

196
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:19,500
would also have a huge return.

197
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,800
Then Lubao3's production lines,

198
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,720
are they still going to be added?

199
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:30,450
You must spend the money on the most important thing.

200
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,390
Pan Zhiyong will not agree.

201
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:38,500
If he chooses to do something, no one will be able to change his mind.

202
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,320
That's not necessarily true.

203
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:45,510
Didn't he wholeheartedly want Li Siyu to be the sales director?

204
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,880
That didn't work.

205
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:54,110
Lubao is our Lubao.

206
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:56,740
It's not just one person's.

207
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,330
A toast to our Lubao.

208
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,630
Sister Yuan is back?

209
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:49,810
- Sister Yuan! You're finally back! 
 - You've finally returned!

210
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:52,090
- Long time no see. 
 - You haven't changed at all!

211
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,590
Sister Yuan missed us so much.

212
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:55,790
Sister Yuan, I just knew you'd be back.

213
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:58,710
Sister Yuan, your complexion is great today.

214
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:01,270
Sister Yuan, we cleaned up your office for you.

215
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:03,150
Quick, come take a look!

216
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,770
It smells very nice.

217
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:18,870
Sister Yuan, we finally got you back.

218
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:21,100
We missed you so much!

219
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,630
Sister Yuan,

220
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:25,740
- did Li Siyu mistreat you guys? 
 - Of course.

221
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:28,460
Sister Yuan, you didn't know...

222
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:31,110
Didn't Siyu make you go to Changsha three times

223
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:33,540
and give you all the commission?

224
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,120
Why did she do that?

225
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,030
She said you helped her that way in the past.

226
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:43,510
- Behind my back, she probably said a lot of bad things about me. 
 - That's actually not true.

227
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:46,830
She always said that it was pretty sad that you guys had a bad relationship in the end.

228
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:49,410
She wished for an opportunity to make up with you.

229
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:53,220
Sister Yuan, telling you the truth, Li Siyu is actually a pretty good person.

230
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,480
She's pretty much the same as you.

231
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,970
No, no, no. She's still a little worse than you.

232
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,790
Sister Yuan, hi.

233
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:12,770
Come in.

234
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:17,600
Hello, Senior Brother.

235
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:22,460
The sales department's performance has been dropping lately.

236
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,450
We need you to take control immediately.

237
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:27,460
- I got it. 
 - Also,

238
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:31,330
give me the name list of all the people you plan to fire from the sales department as soon as possible.

239
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:34,690
Why would people from the sales department be fired?

240
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,570
Li Siyu's team members.

241
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:40,610
You want to leave them here and cause you trouble?

242
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:45,150
After I left, Li Siyu didn't fire a single one of my team members.

243
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:48,180
If I come back and fire all of her people,

244
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:51,500
wouldn't it seem like my magnanimity is worse than hers?

245
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:57,040
You're going to leave every single one of them here?

246
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00,290
I took a look. They're all very capable people.

247
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:02,960
Not only do I want to keep them, but I also want to use them in multiple areas.

248
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,300
Li Siyu also came up with some sales plans that are very useful.

249
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,700
I want to continue using those as well.

250
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:14,420
You lost to her in the past

251
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,890
because your heart was too kind.

252
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:23,530
You always thought I was too kind, and that's why this happened.

253
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:27,440
But on the flip side, if my heart were even kinder,

254
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,760
maybe there would be a different result.

255
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,730
Director Zhang, you only need to invest four million and then the project can start.

256
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:38,820
Three million is also acceptable.

257
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:42,440
Two million?

258
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,010
I will guarantee you

259
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:47,510
as long as we have increasing users, the cash flow is not a problem.

260
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:57,060
Okay. I'll get in touch later.

261
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:02,500
Hello, Miss. When can we bring the food?

262
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:06,710

Hello. The subscriber you are trying to reach is currently unavailable.

266
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:39,120
Sorry, the subscriber—

267
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,290
Sister Siyu, I'm so sorry. The meeting just ended.

268
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:50,490
It's okay, it's okay. Take a seat.

269
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,760
How come you're the only one? Where are the others?

270
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:56,220
Director Yuan said that since the meeting went late, she'd treat everyone to a meal.

271
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:00,410
Xiao Jia and Xiao Tian also went with her?

272
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:04,060
Sister Yuan really likes them.

273
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,770
Sister Siyu, please don't be angry.

274
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:09,870
What's there to be angry about? I was the one who brought them up.

275
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:12,780
If they are respected by a new leader, then I should be happy.

276
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,450
How come you didn't go?

277
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:17,600
I thought that by inviting me here, you must've had some very important thing to share,

278
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,840
so I should at least come over and see.

279
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:24,800
Did Director Yuan embarrass you?

280
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,620
Everyone says that Director Yuan changed a bit after returning.

281
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,760
How so?

282
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:35,630
I'm not sure either. I think that she's more gentle than she was before.

283
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:40,820
Sister Siyu, the truth is that everyone misses you greatly.

284
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:44,080
One day, Xiao Jia even said that one day, if Director Yuan leaves,

285
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,070
you could come back to be the director again.

286
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:48,760
Director? I'm now too good for that.

287
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:52,480
Now what I'm going to take is at least a general manager or chairman of the board.

288
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,630
Sister Siyu, you'll definitely be able to.

289
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:56,850
Okay. Let's stop the small talk.

290
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:59,460
Lin Ling, I plan to start my own business.

291
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:02,340
It's a great project. I plan to put it on the market in five years.

292
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:05,150
Now, I am officially asking you to join.

293
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:10,820
Then... I have to resign from Lubao?

294
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:15,410
Of course. Before the project is out, we have to be dedicated to it 24 hours a day.

295
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:19,420
- But... 
 - Trust me. If I want something to happen, it will.

296
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:24,100
I've thought about it multiple times. It's going to be successful, there's no way it will fail.

297
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:30,820
This is my marketing plan. If you read it, you'll understand.

298
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:39,300
Sister Siyu, I'm sorry.

299
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:42,310
I only just got used to selling batteries.

300
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:44,330
You also know my dad's situation.

301
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:48,760
I think... It's better if I have a steady job.

302
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,090
This is a once in a lifetime opportunity.

303
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:57,190
But I...

304
00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:00,800
I might not be suitable.

305
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:04,970
Didn't you say that you would follow me for the rest of your life?

306
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:07,540
I meant in Lubao,

307
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:10,030
I would follow you.

00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:19,620
I get it now.

309
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:37,510
Sister Siyu, I promised Director Yuan

310
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:41,140
that I'd go over to her after meeting you.

I've already paid the surgery fee.

346
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,910
You don't need to care for me.

347
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:48,580
I need to go to work.

348
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:52,770
I will leave the meal here. Help yourself.

349
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:05,680
- Please enjoy it. 
 - Thank you.

350
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,060
I met Lin Ling in the company.

351
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:22,330
She said you wanted to start a start-up business.

352
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:24,290
Yes.

353
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:26,870
What project?

354
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,900
The project is called "Laidianle" 
 (T/N: means the electricity is coming)

355
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:32,990
It's a renting platform of a shared storage battery.

356
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:36,390
It's innovative. How is it going?

357
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:40,760
I already decided to give it up.

358
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,480
Why?

359
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,340
When everyone listens to my idea, they all say it's good.

360
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:51,000
But I can't handle the investment.

361
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,340
There is no one willing to join.

362
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:56,100
How much do you need to prepare to start?

363
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:59,120
- Four million yuan. 
 - How much have you collected?

364
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:03,560
If I add the money after selling the house, it's a bit over one million.

365
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,700
Lubao will invest three million.

366
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:08,810
GM Pan...

367
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:14,880
This is my project plan.

368
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,890
Good. I don't need to read this.

369
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:19,730
I just need to see the person.

370
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,550
GM Pan, I replace alcohol with tea.

371
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:26,970
No worries. I won't let you down for sure.

372
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:29,590
After half of the year, I need to see the result.

373
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:31,580
Sure!

374
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:41,480
GM Pan, how is Lubao going?

375
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,400
Not good.

376
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,390
Why?

377
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:48,580
I prepared to build additional two of Lubao3's production lines.

378
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:53,150
It was vetoed by Wang Ziru and Fangzhan together as a result.

379
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:56,400
The two of them together?

380
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,690
I doubt at that time

381
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:01,630
the vote which she gave to Yuan Huizhong

382
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:04,410
is a good gesture for Fang Zhan.

383
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:08,730
I asked Sister Ziru about this.

384
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:13,270
She did that because Chen Yiming requested this.

385
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:17,110
Chen Yiming doesn't hope that I work hard outside.

386
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:18,880
He hopes that I can return home.

387
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:23,250
Li Siyu, do you believe it?

388
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:27,830
It is true. For this, Chen Yiming and I almost broke up.

389
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:31,290
Wang Ziru, this woman,

390
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:33,660
will do so much for a subordinate's request,

391
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:35,890
on the issue that involves so much interest,

392
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:38,720
will she consider for a subordinate in the end?

393
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,620
I don't believe it.

394
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,990
You think?

395
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:47,190
I think who she voted for

396
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:49,910
was after she deliberated carefully.

397
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:54,490
Besides, she and Fang are so well together.

398
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:58,180
It is definitely closely related to that vote.

399
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:01,440
I don't think so.

400
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:12,670
I should have kept that 22%.

401
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:18,110
I don't understand.

402
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:20,830
You don't  need to understand.

403
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:25,310
Just do this well. I can handle the company.

404
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,930
Xiao Han, I'm Li Siyu.

405
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:37,370
I was planning to start a company in your business park.

406
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:40,290
I stopped for a while. Now I have decide to restart.

407
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:44,850
- No problem, Director Li. Can you come to apply now? 
 - Now?

408
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:47,390
Today is the last day of our park's promotion.

409
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:51,130
If you apply after today, something like the rent discount,

410
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:53,140
you can't get.

411
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,400
I will come right now.

412
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:11,100
[Siyu]

413
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:16,260
Siyu, where are you now? I'm almost there.

414
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:19,940
Yiming, sorry, I have to deal with something now.

415
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,850
How about we cancel today?

416
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:23,560
What do you need to do?

417
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:27,550
I will go to the park to hand in the application to start up a company.

418
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,760
You haven't given up your business plan?

419
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:38,710
There is some change now. I want to...

420
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:42,830
Come over here now. Let's settle the wedding photo first.

421
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:46,180
Yiming,

422
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:51,060
can we postpone this?

423
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,570
No.

424
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:56,020
I really can't make it today.

425
00:33:56,020 --> 00:34:00,610
Siyu,

426
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:02,380
I'm at the gate of the wedding dress shop. I'm waiting for you.

427
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:57,180
Director Li, this is our project introduction.

428
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:00,390
Now we reduce 5% of the tax revenue every year. 

429
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,290
This is our...

430
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:06,090
- This is the material you want. 
 - Yes, yes.  Thank you.

431
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:10,350
Director Li, this is our preferential policy.

432
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:14,920
Investment purpose. Regional advantage. The product fostering.

433
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,980
Thank you very much.

434
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:56,900
You are welcome, Director Li. It's my job.

435
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:00,760
Director Li, I will walk you here.

436
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,900
- See you. 
 - See you.

437
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,720
Hello, how can I help you?

438
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,850
Mr. Chen, my boyfriend

439
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:20,540
booked the afternoon to try on the dress.

440
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:23,440
He just left.

441
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,910
- Thank you. 
 - You are welcome.

442
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:48,150
[Siyu]

443
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:07,460
[Siyu]

444
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,670
[Siyu]

445
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:27,920
[Siyu]

446
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:10,520
- Hello? 
 - Hello? Mr. Chen.

447
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:14,220
Ms. Li's phone is busy all the time. I had to call you.

448
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:16,160
What's wrong?

449
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,660
I checked your apartment.

450
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:21,370
Now you can sell at 5.2 million.

451
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:24,290
But you will suffer a loss of the transaction tax.

452
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:28,570
Who told you that we wanted to sell the house?

453
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:31,850
Ms. Li told me. She asked me to calculate the price.

454
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:28,910
Hello?

455
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:31,250
Where are you right now?

456
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:34,210
The framework of the project and system both have been shaped up.

457
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:36,700
Now what I need is—

458
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,570
I will call you back later.

459
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:48,850
You are selling the house?

460
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:51,170
Yes.

461
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:57,060
Li Siyu,

462
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:59,270
are you really that crazy?

463
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:01,450
I'm not.

464
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:06,780
This is a demonstration that the expert made for me.

465
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:10,780
Their conclusion is that this project perfectly solves the problem of the electric bicycle riders.

466
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:15,770
Any business model's success must be an efficient solution to the problem in the market.

467
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:17,760
Can I not listen to you saying this?

468
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,940
Why not?

469
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:22,890
This is the evaluation of the industry's experienced people.

470
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:26,140
They all said this project was a combined innovation of new energy and the internet.

471
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:29,270
- It is another revolution to lead people's transportation.
 - Enough!

472
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,340
It is enough.

473
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:35,210
GM Pan decided to invest three million to me.

474
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:39,290
Add one million from the house, I have all the money to start the project.

475
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:46,240
GM Pan. Li Siyu, I think you were completely brainwashed by him.

476
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,100
Three million.

477
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:51,240
This is not called brainwashing. This is approbation.

478
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:56,780
Let it go. Okay?

479
00:40:56,780 --> 00:41:00,690
I got three million from nothing. Why should I let it go?

480
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:03,690
Because you've already lost your reasoning and judgment.

481
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:05,750
Chen Yiming,

482
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:08,290
everyone says it's a very rare opportunity to start a business.

483
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:10,880
You say I lost my judgment.

484
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,460
Everyone says it's a good opportunity.

485
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:14,850
You said I lost reasoning.

486
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:20,450
There are many good projects.

487
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:23,450
You have to see if it's suitable or not.

488
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:25,920
Opportunity is important.

489
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,370
But you need to see if you have the condition or not.

490
00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:31,620
I can create the condition but the opportunity doesn't wait.

491
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:34,010
You can't mess things up!

492
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:41,520
Then what do you think is not a mess?

493
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:45,460
- For example— 
 - Getting married, for example?

494
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:53,400
Chen Yiming, I'm going to say this one more time for you.

495
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:57,250
I'm already over 30 years old and I have achieved nothing.

496
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:59,820
Also, you know,

497
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:03,940
I was just beaten by others. It's impossible for me to give up now!

498
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:10,650
Then I will ask you a question.

499
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:12,950
Do you still want to marry me?

500
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:15,660
How can you not understand me?

501
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:20,410
- I want to counterattack. I want to win it back. I want to try to bring credit to myself! 
 - I'm asking you now!

502
00:42:20,410 --> 00:42:22,870
Do you still want to marry me?

503
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:27,180
I'd prefer to continue my business rather than marrying you!

504
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:30,170
If it's like this, then we have to break up.

505
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:45,470
Siyu...

506
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,760
Siyu,

507
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,850
- I didn't mean this. 
 - I agree.

508
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:02,490
We should break up.

509

00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,350
♫  The memories  ♫

521
00:44:20,350 --> 00:44:24,000
♫ won't let me escape  ♫

522
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:32,610
 [Dear Myself (亲爱的自己) by Zhu Yi Long (朱一龙), Keyso (寿君超)] 

523
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:35,370
♫  How are you?  ♫

524
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:39,040
♫  Listen to me about the latest news  ♫

525
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:43,560
♫  Some sweet and some hopeless  ♫

526
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:48,490
♫  There are also some that were never said  ♫

527
00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:51,970
♫  It's been so long, I've already learned to let go  ♫

528
00:44:51,970 --> 00:44:56,550
♫  Let go of obsessions, of the present, and of greed  ♫

529
00:44:56,550 --> 00:45:01,740
♫  Yet I've never thought of letting you go  ♫

530
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:05,060
♫  Yeah…  ♫

531
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:08,400
♫  Oh…  ♫

532
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,840
♫  En…  ♫

533
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,370
♫  Letting go…  ♫

534
00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:14,800
♫  Dear Myself  ♫

535
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,880
♫  Listen to the voice inside  ♫

536
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:21,920
♫  In this lonely world, be cautious ♫

537
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,240
 After we're hurt, we learn to cherish  ♫

538
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:27,740
♫  Dear Myself  ♫

539
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:30,950
♫  Use all your strength  ♫

540
00:45:30,950 --> 00:45:35,250
♫  Missing the simple you from the past  ♫

541
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:37,370
♫  Turn difficulties into courage  ♫

542
00:45:37,370 --> 00:45:42,300
♫  Don't back down from the crowd  ♫

543
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:44,620
♫  Growth is inevitably accompanied by setbacks  ♫

544
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:47,240
♫  The best way to overcome difficulties is to smile  ♫

545
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,470
♫  All the punishment given by fate, are you afraid?  ♫

546
00:45:49,470 --> 00:45:51,560
♫  Let everything go, all those concerns, real or fake  ♫

547
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:54,870
♫  Cannot erase the scar, but it's just a scar  ♫

548
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:56,530
♫  We are so small yet so determined  ♫

549
00:45:56,530 --> 00:45:58,240
♫  Occasionally fussy and occasionally firm  ♫

550
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,590
♫  If growth leaves a trace, then the trace is left be tears  ♫

551
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:04,320
♫  Your back that I've always been chasing  ♫

552
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:06,500
♫  Finally turned around to hug me tightly  ♫

553
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:10,160
♫  It's still that familiar you  ♫

554
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:13,410
♫  Yeah...  ♫

555
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:17,440
♫  Oh...  ♫

556
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:22,920
♫  Dear Myself  ♫

557
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:26,270
♫  Listen to the voice inside  ♫

558
00:46:26,270 --> 00:46:30,310
♫  I'll give you the warm that the wind took  ♫

559
00:46:30,310 --> 00:46:32,610
♫  Hugging you, hugging me  ♫

560
00:46:32,610 --> 00:46:35,900
♫   Dear Myself  ♫

561
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:40,050
♫  The sky has finally cleared  ♫

562
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:43,250
♫  We've never been so clear-headed  ♫

563
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:45,360
♫  Looking for the past me who  ♫

564
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:49,000
♫  Ran forward without evading anything  ♫

565
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,330
♫  Ran forward without evading anything  ♫

566
00:46:52,330 --> 00:46:55,580
♫  Listen to the voice inside  ♫

567
00:46:55,580 --> 00:47:00,000
♫  The sky has finally cleared  ♫
