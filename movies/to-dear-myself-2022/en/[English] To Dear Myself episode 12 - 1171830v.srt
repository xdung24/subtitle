Siyu.

5
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:52,510
It's a total of 5.1 million yuan.

6
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:54,420
I got it all back.

7
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,200
Lin Ling, last week, I was in a bad mood.

8
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,700
I shouldn't have vented my anger at you. I'm sorry.

9
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,000
No, Sister Siyu, I was too stupid.

10
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,600
Trust me, I've learned my lesson.

11
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,200
In the future, they will no longer be able to find my mistakes.

12
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,900
That's good.

13
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,700
5 million yuan a week?

14
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,800
That's good. You've almost caught up to my record.

15
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,200
Your record was...?

16
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,400
Six million yuan a week.

17
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,900
How did you do it?

18
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,000
I was also scolded by Sister Yuan and I got annoyed.

19
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,200
I took purchases like crazy.

20
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,900
Then I made my record.

21
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,800
You can go back to work.

22
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,400
You still have time to meet with Director Guo.

23
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,300
This is your best choice.

24
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,100
You should take a look.

25
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,200
If you don't like it, then you can go.

26
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,200
- Hello? 
 - Hi, Yiming.

27
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,200
I'm about to leave the house.

28
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,200
You don't have to go anymore.

29
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,200
They just informed me

30
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,400
that the position of copywrite planning

31
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,500
has already been filled.

32
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,300
Got it.

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,300
Hello?

35
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,600
Zhu Xiaobai, were you looking for me?

36
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,580
Yiming, my father retired.

37
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,500
He gave me the position!

38
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,500
As the Wanguan Group's Chairman and General Manager,

39
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,900
I am officially inviting you

40
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,300
to come and help me.

41
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:05,000
I'll leave you the position of Vice President. 

42
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,300
How does it sound? Come back to your hometown!

43
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,700
Yiming?

44
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,800
Yiming?

45
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,500
Yiming! Are you listening?

46
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,200
Hello?

47
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,400

Yes.

56
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,700
Weren't you going to go to Fenglin to do copywrite planning?

57
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,820
They didn't like me.

I have Director Guo's number.

60

I can't go there.

61
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,000
I don't understand. Why do you have so many negative feelings toward him?

62
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,200
Did he do anything to provoke you?

63
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,900

can get me a job after laughing and drinking with him.

00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,800
Brother Li always mentions you. He really admires your work capacity.

76
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,800
I have also admired you for a while now,

77
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,800
and I feel so lucky seeing you in person.

78
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,800

Huizhong, Liu Yang and I have been good friends for many years.

84
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:49,710
He is really nice. You can directly ask him to do you favor.

85
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,720
-Then I'll say it  
 - Okay, go ahead.

86
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,150
Mr. Liu, it's like this.

87
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:56,950
Our Lubao Company wants to take part in the bid for the whole city's street lamp renovation.

88
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:00,120
And we'd like you to look after us.

89
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:07,740
Director Yuan, we haven't officially announced. How did you get to know of this?

90
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:11,780
I even know you are the team leader of the bidding.

91
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,990
Liu Yang, Huizhong is my sister.

92
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:18,570
She is nice and accountable for her job.

93
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:22,850
If you promise to cooperate with her, she will help you to complete your job very well.

Director Li. Director Yuan. You have the wrong person.

95
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:33,530
Although I'm the team leader, we have experts to evaluate.

96
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:37,590
I really cannot help you with this. I'm very sorry.

97
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:41,260
You told me this.

98
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,250
How much bidding do I attend every year?

99
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:46,630
I know how to do this.

100
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:51,100
Director Li, everything I said is true.

101

Teacher Liu, you didn't enjoy yourself to the full!

140

Page 13, the 2nd line. Where does this number come from?

- You're still at the office? 
 - Yes.

148
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:29,390
- Have you eaten? 
 - No, I haven't.

149
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:31,320
It's already this late, how have you not eaten yet?

150
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,270
I haven't had the chance.

151
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:35,650
Then what were you doing?

152
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:38,020
We have to turn in those reports early tomorrow morning,

153
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:40,280
so I'm working on them all over again.

154
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,910
The report is already fine, you don't need to keep working on it.

155
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:47,320
No, Brother Yang, this is a project you're in charge of.

156
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:51,050
I must finish all the work completely.

157
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,140
I want you to go home and rest immediately.

158
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,040
It's nothing, Brother Yang, you don't have to manage me.

159
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:01,250
I'll turn in the most perfect report tomorrow morning.

160

Brother Yang, why are you here?

161
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:55,690
I bought you some food.

162
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:58,420
There is porridge. Eat it when it's hot.

163
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,690
What's wrong?

164
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:38,930
Brother Yang, can you not treat me so nicely?

165
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:44,770
Is this already nice?

00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:48,350
What's their name?

172
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:50,620
They're named...

173
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,730
Oh, you're back.

174
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:54,510
Did you eat?

175
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:56,680
Didn't you say you had a business dinner so you would come back late?

176
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,990
Back this early?

177
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:11,890
You don't feel well because of drinking too much?

178
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:38,070
Who did you go and eat with tonight?

179
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:42,360
A bunch of friends before.

00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,350
Were they men or women?

181
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:47,980
There were both men and women. Why?

182
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:51,890
Why is the perfume on your jacket so strong?

183
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:54,460
I never use perfume.

184
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:58,880
Guess who organized the dinner for tonight?

185
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,460
Who?

186
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:04,000
Your company's Yuan Huizhong.

187
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:09,270
- What was she doing with you? 
 - Isn't it the bidding thing.

188
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:11,960
She asked some of her friends to ask me out.

189
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,670
Don't promise her.

190
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:16,030
She is the competitor of Siyu.

191
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:19,180
Even if there was no Li Siyu, I still wouldn't dare provoke them.

192
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:23,220
- What happened? 
 - I have firsthand knowledge of Director Yuan's personality.

193
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:26,600
- She tried to seduce me! 
 - Shameless.

194
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,920
They even made me drink. Old Li and they did too.

195
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:33,410
I assume they got some benefit. They kicked up a fuss.

196
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:36,260
I couldn't take it anymore, so I left.

197
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:42,370
I'm going to go shower.

198
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,910
That happened last night?

199
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:54,770
Liu Yang was terrified.

200
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:58,680
Yesterday after he got back, he was still fluttering with fear.

201
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,740
She also fixed her eye on this bidding.

202
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,720
I know now...

203
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,790
some rumor about her,

204
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:10,860
it was all true.

205
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:13,070
He's not usually like that.

206
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:15,990
He's surely in a bad mood because of me.

207
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:19,470
Don't worry. Liu Yang won't respond to her.

208
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:24,500
Zhizhi, you need to watch Liu Yang more closely.

209
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,630
I don't want the two of us to end up with

210
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:29,300
my proposal failing and your husband leaving you.

211
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,200
Liu Yang and I, though we have had our share of trouble,

212
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:38,400
our love and affection for each other are steady. There won't be any problems.

213
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,900
Brother Yang might be able to do the right thing himself,

214
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:43,600
but he can't restrain others.

215
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,600
Good morning, Mr. Liu.

216
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,300
Good morning, Mr. Liu.

217
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,300
Sister Yun,

218
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:10,900
I think you've probably misunderstood me.

219
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,330
All of my care for you

220
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:18,000
was because I am your leader,

221
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,900
teacher, and senior brother.

222
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,300
I had no other intentions.

223
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,600
I-I understand.

224
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:37,700
I just wanted to say

225
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:47,500
I... I'm not just some casual girl.

226
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:53,370
I... I've really...

227
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:57,350
I've really fallen in love with you.

228
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,000
I'm already married.

229
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,620
I have a wife and child.

230
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:24,200
I must be responsible for them.

231
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,600
Brother Yang, don't worry.

232
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,700
I don't have a covetous heart.

233
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:37,600
I won't disturb your family.

234
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,800
I won't disturb you either.

235
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:45,600
I just want to look at you from a distance.

236
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,710
I want to help you every day.

237
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,800
That's all.

238
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,500
You...

239
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,000
This is not good.

240
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,170
I swear.

241
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:07,600
What happened last night will never happen again.

242
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,700
I will control my emotions.

243
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,400
You're still young.

244
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,200
There are still so many possibilities ahead of you.

245
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:30,880
My future is filled with secretly pining for you.

246
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:34,780
You can't be like this!

247
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,250
I'll listen to you about anything else,

248
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:49,100
as long as you tell me to, no matter how hard it is, I will do it.

249
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:53,400
But to forbid me from loving you...

250
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,800
You can't do that.

251
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:01,410
I can't do it either.

252
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,400
Were you scolded by the boss?

253
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Mr. Liu, I put the report you wanted on your desk.

254
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,800
Thank you.

255
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,900
Mr. Liu, I want to bring Wei Yayun to take a look at the Dongfeng factory at 3:00 today.

256
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,800
Wei Yayun did overtime work this week already.

257
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,600
I want to let her go home early and rest. Please pick someone else.

258
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,200
Okay.

259
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,400
Brother Dai! Brother Dai, please come with me this afternoon.

260
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:59,400
My file name is called Guangcai Engineering Construction Project.

261
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,400
The client representative is Liu Yang.

262
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,400
Sister Yuan's file is called Street Light Bidding Project.

263
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,600
The client representative is still to be determined.

264
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,500
When did she record it?

265
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,700
The 16th of this month.

266
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,400
I recorded mine on the 13th.

267
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,500
- Yes, that's what it says. 
 - Wonderful.

268
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:21,200
Yesterday, I might have been too anxious. It's possible I scared him off.

269
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,600
Then, what should we do moving forward?

270
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,700
We need to fix our rhythm.

271
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:30,100
Later, I'll send him an apology text.

272
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:34,000
In a few days, I'll arrange for Director Li to have a cup of coffee with him.

273
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,200
Do you need me to prepare anything?

274
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,910
You should go to the administration department and prepare some materials.

275
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:45,000
This time, all we will be discussing is official work business. Nothing else.

276
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,700
Go now.

277
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,200
- Hello, Xiaotang? 
 - What's up?

278
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,300
I need a copy of the company's product brochure and video.

279
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:58,700
We still have the corporate culture brochure. I'll get you one.

280
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:07,000
Doesn't Sister Yuan never give clients these kinds of things?

281
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,800
Don't even get me started. Last night, we met someone with a very strange way of thinking.

282
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,200
Sister Yuan needed to use peculiar methods.

283
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,000
Peculiar?

284
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,300
Guess what happened!

285
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Sister Yuan didn't do anything about it?

286
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,100
Didn't I say? He ran away!

287
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,800
Zhizhi?

288
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,700
Don't move.

289
00:30:57,170 --> 00:30:59,460
Are you unable to understand human speech or something?

290
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,800
Liu Jie, don't you have business to attend to?

291
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,400
Why would you have the spare time to stick your nose into little things like this?

292
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,000
Sister Yuan, I just can't help but be angry with her.

293
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:16,100
Liu Jie, just assume that her mother didn't teach her basic etiquette.

294
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,900
You're the one without etiquette!

295
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,300
What did you just say?

296
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,000
Apologize to me for what you just said.

297
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,200
You wish.

298
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,500
- Are you going to apologize or not? 
 - Let go of me!

299
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,200
You know what you did!

300
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,400
You're just an old shrew.

301
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,300
- You're a shameless creature! 
 - What are you guys doing?

302
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,000
What is going on?

303
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,200
- Siyu? 
 - You dared to push me?

304
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,000
You dared to hit Sister Yuan?

305
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,600
How could you hit Sister Yuan?

306
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,000
Stop fighting!

307
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,100
Those who don't want to work can all go home!

308
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,100
Are you finished working?

309
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,900
Hurry up and do it!

310
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:23,000
The approved processing results are as follows.

311
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,600
For Sales Team One Leader,

312
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,200
Yuan Huizhong, and Sales Team Two Leader,

313
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,400
Li Siyu, the punishment fee is ¥5,000.

314
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,800
The entire company condemns

315
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,800
Zhang Zhizhi, an employee of the Administration Department

316
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,200
and Sales Department employee Liu Jie.

317
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,000
The penalty fee is ¥1,000.

318
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,300
The entire company condemns them.

319
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Understand?

320
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:50,900
Within three days, hand your respective payments to the Finance Department.

321
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,630
I never would have thought

322
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:25,600
that there would be a day where we got into a fistfight.

323
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,200
Sister Yuan, I'm sorry.

324
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,900
I've really failed.

325
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,800
It's just that when I saw the two of you gang up on Zhizhi,

326
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,400
I got too impulsive.

327
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:52,500
But no matter the circumstance, I still shouldn't have hit you.

328
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:56,600
I'm really sorry. I'll pay your penalty debt.

329
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,700
I don't need that money

330
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,700
and I don't accept your apology.

331
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:11,570
Then, what should I do?

332
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:16,200
If you still see me as a superior

333
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,200
and admit our friendship in the past,

334
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,080
then you will fulfill your promise,

335
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,800
and leave the sales director competition.

336
00:34:31,410 --> 00:34:35,590
Sister Yuan, I can't.

337
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:37,570
Why not?

338
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:41,580
Because I can't let my group members down.

339
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:44,610
Because I want to be the Sales Director.

340
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,220
And also because...

341
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:52,330
you honestly don't really take me as your disciple.

342
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,130
You also don't really care about our friendship.

343
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:00,090
How could I not admit you as my disciple?

344
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:03,380
If it weren't for me, you would have been fired long ago!

345
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:08,330
For you, I carried so many burdens cleaned up so many messes, how could I possibly not value our friendship?

346
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,690
Li Siyu,

347
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:19,840
you're just a graceful, vengeful viper.

348
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:26,510
Sister Yuan, if I angered you today,

349
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:28,900
it was because you forced it out of me.

350
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:34,530
Li Siyu, I'm warning you.

351
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,630
I am determined to be the sales director.

352
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:42,220
The first thing I will do as the sales director

353
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:44,680
is fire you.

354
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,850
Sister Yuan,

355
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:49,800
I am also determined to be the sales director.

356
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:53,120
The first thing I will do is thank you.

357
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:58,280
Are you really going to rely on yourself and your group of incompetent idiots?

358
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,080
Yes.

359
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:03,250
I will rely on my skill, my ability to lead my group,

360
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:06,350
and my group of "incompetent idiots" to counterattack you.

361
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:11,370
Also, I'm about to represent Lubao in the bidding.

362
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:14,570
Guangcai Company's Renovation Project's

363
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:18,380
- total bid is 28 million. 
 - That's my project!

364
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:29,100
I'm sorry. My record was before yours.

365
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:41,190
GM Pan, I didn't control the sales department well enough.

366
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:43,490
I will review it with you.

367
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:45,980
The Supervision Department has already taken care of everything.

368
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:48,880
They will learn their lesson.

369
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:55,250
After giving me the sales department, something like this happened.

370
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:57,410
This responsibility, I really...

371
00:36:57,410 --> 00:37:00,490
Departments with many people naturally have more problems.

372
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:02,410
It's hard to prevent such things.

373
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:06,490
In the beginning, these two groups competing was a good thing,

374
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:09,280
but this competition needs to be done in a composed manner.

375
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,020
During this time, these two groups,

376
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:14,420
in order to fight for clients, it has caused a whole lot of trouble.

377
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:17,380
I think we need to summarize

378
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:19,300
and rectify this situation.

379
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:22,120
Continue.

380
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,080
I was thinking

381
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,070
we should have the Consumer Department cooperate with us

382
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:28,560
and clean out our clients.

383
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,790
We should give the two groups their own territories,

384
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:34,460
and let them do their business within those territories.

385
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:38,180
This way, we can potentially develop more clients,

386
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:40,420
and we can prevent

387
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:43,540
this kind of vicious competition from happening again.

388
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:47,100
How should we divide them up?

389
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:51,670
Li Siyu knows a lot about the electric car market.

390
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:53,600
We should give that area to her.

391
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,770
It's true that Yuan Huizhong also developed many consumers there,

392
00:37:56,770 --> 00:38:01,080
but generally speaking, I would say that Li Siyu is better suited there.

393
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,960
Would Yuan Huizhong accept that?

394
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,170
I can do her business.

395
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:13,230
Other than that, the toy department, home appliances, and medical equipment departments...

396
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:15,300
I also recommend them for Li Siyu.

397
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,730
She's very familiar with these industries.

398
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:21,590
With the same clients, others can get about 20 million

399
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:24,860
but she can make 30 million or even 40 million.

400
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:31,540
If we do it this way, it's not fair to other people in the sales department, is it?

401
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:33,930
But this way, it would limit

402
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:36,940
the exertion of the other salespersons' abilities.

403
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:39,380
For example, Yuan Huizhong.

404
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:41,860
She's very familiar with government and public relations.

405
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:45,900
We can give projects that have to do with the law to her.

406
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,560
Of course, she will also wonder

407
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:51,650
why should Li Siyu take charge of such a big market of scooters?

408
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:55,360
But for the company, you must sacrifice things.

409
00:38:57,810 --> 00:39:01,790
I think a good competitive mechanism,

410
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:05,520
needs to mobilize all people's initiatives and potentials.

411
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,630
Not to sacrifice someone or help someone to achieve something.

412
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:10,540
Right?

413
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:14,200
But now the sales department is a bit messy.

414
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,600
The mess is the surface.

415
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,550
As long as the business keeps growing,

416
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:21,820
it means this mechanism works.

417
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:24,100
We'll do as follows with the previous rule.

418
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:27,740
The person who put the client on the company's records first will take care of the client.

419
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:31,040
Okay.

420
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,500
Sister Siyu.

421
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:55,840
I've paid your fine already.

422
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,360
Don't go and pay by yourself.

423
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,900
- I will transfer the money to you by Wechat. 
 - No need.

424
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:04,540
You keep your salary for Yuwei's after-school class!

425
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:08,120
How can I thank you?

426
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:11,210
Cook two nice dishes and feed me.

427
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:16,270
Okay. Tonight, you invite brother Yiming together.

428
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:18,420
You come to my place to have dinner.

429
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:23,790
- I have to work this evening. 
 - Meeting a client again?

430
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:27,750
Sister Siyu,

431
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,460
this fight you helped me with,

432
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:34,260
will it affect your competition with Yuan Huizhong?

433
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:36,880
- No. 
 - Really?

434
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:41,670
Don't worry about it. We can still secure our victory.

435
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:47,240
Right, has Brother Yiming found a job yet?

436
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:53,100
He wants to go back to his hometown and develop his career there.

437
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:56,210
- Then what about you? 
 - I definitely have to stay.

438
00:40:56,210 --> 00:41:00,050
Then you'd be in different cities! That can't work!

439
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:05,100
Sister Siyu, you have to convince Brother Yiming.

440
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:13,920
I don't want to look at it anymore.

441
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:19,470
Please don't say that!

442
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:22,680
Senior Brother,

443
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:26,860
- I'm so tired. 
 - Who isn't?

444
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:29,010
I'm also very tired.

445
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:36,750
Do you know what I want to do most right now?

446
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:41,130
I want to regulate my body

447
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:44,740
and then peacefully eat three meals a day.

448
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:49,560
If I have time, I want to accompany my son

449
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:52,440
and help him with homework and memorizing vocabulary.

450
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:57,880
I also want to find a boyfriend and live a peaceful life.

451
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:01,450
These can all happen,

452
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:05,400
You can't relax at this critical moment.

453
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:09,130
Li Siyu's group,

454
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:11,620
they're acting like they're all crazy.

455
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:13,740
I really don't want to fight them anymore.

456
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:16,600
Why not? You must!

457
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:28,210
Huizhong, this matter,

458
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:30,320
I only told you my real intention.

459
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:33,680
Your competition with Li Siyu is related to everyone's interests.

460
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,640
It's also related to my destiny in Lubao.

461
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:38,670
In addition, it relates to Lubao's destiny.

462
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:43,020
We've talked about this for many times.

463
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:45,370
I don't care if I will get kicked out or not.

464
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:47,270
But I'm worried about Lubao.

465
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:50,620
Yes, Pan Zhiyong is the founder of Lubao.

466
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:52,860
But for more than a decade,

467
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:56,820
all the money, sweat, blood and youth we have give to Lubao,

468
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:58,880
is it less than Pan Zhiyong?

469
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:04,080
I can't see him ruin Lubao standing aside.

470
00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:08,530
Also, Pan Zhiyong...

471
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:11,790
has never cared about the senior executives' and the staff's interest.

472
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:16,420
It is me that strived for all these equity distributions.

473
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:19,730
If I get kicked out, then he himself can decide everything.

474
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:22,660
Our interest in the future can never be guaranteed.

475
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:24,790
Even if you get the shares,

476
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:27,150
they will be diluted very quickly.

477
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:30,850
He will do this.

478
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:37,190
So, you must stick to the sales department.

479
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:40,330
The company is doing equity financing.

480
00:43:40,330 --> 00:43:43,310
As long as you can persist until the new shareholders join,

481
00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:45,490
we have the chance.

482
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:48,300
We have to change to turn around the situation.

 Timing & Subtitles by My Dear Myself Team @Viki.com 

484
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:59,170
How can I stick to my job?

485
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:02,330
According to the rule, the government project belongs Li Siyu.

486
00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:04,850
Your suggestion to reform was denied by Pan Zhiyong.

487
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:07,340
If Li Siyu gets the 28 million,

488
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:09,340
I lost for sure.

527
00:46:18,730 --> 00:46:22,060
♫   Dear Myself  ♫

528
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:26,080
♫  The sky has finally cleared  ♫

529
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:29,330
♫  We've never been so clear-headed  ♫

530
00:46:29,330 --> 00:46:31,460
♫  Looking for the past me who  ♫

531
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:35,020
♫  Ran forward without evading anything  ♫

532
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:38,260
♫  Ran forward without evading anything  ♫

533
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:41,580
♫  Listen to the voice inside  ♫

534
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:46,120
♫  The sky has finally cleared  ♫
