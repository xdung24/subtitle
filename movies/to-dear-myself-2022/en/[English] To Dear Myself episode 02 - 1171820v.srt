[Episode 2]

4
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,000
Sister Yuan.

5
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,600
Hi, Siyu.

6
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,400
- You worked hard yesterday. 
 - It's not a big deal.

7
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,800
There's no problem with this season, right?

8
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,800
- Not yet. 
 - Really still not.

9
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,000
Not everyone is like you.

10
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,600
I'll think it over again and see where else I can go for more orders.

11
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,900
- Never mind. You haven't taken a break for two weeks. If we come up short, so be it. 
 - No way.

12
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,000
Now's the crucial time that will determine if you can be promoted to Director. We can't let up now.

13
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,200
What's wrong?

14
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,000
Recently, my stomach keeps acting up from time to time.

15
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,400
Come to my office for a bit.

16
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,600
I'll go set down my bag.

17
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,400
- Morning, Sister Siyu. 
 - Good morning, Sister Siyu.

18
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,100
- Good morning. 
 - Good morning, Sister Siyu.

19
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,200
Take this.

20
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,400
I haven't even finished the ones you gave me before.

21
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:02,000
- Keep it in reserve. You should take care of your stomach. Pay attention to how you eat. 
 - Thank you.

22
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,400
Get an invoice. I'm going to give you an extra ¥500, take it as a bonus for your overtime.

23
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,000
I should claim my overtime, too.

24
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,410
You want the ¥500 for normal work?

25
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,900
Okay. I'll speak with Director Fang. He has to sign for it.

26
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,700
Go on.

27
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,000
 [Financial Department]  
 You're welcome. Take care.

28
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,900
Sister Siyu.

29
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,100
In the end, did Brother Yiming propose to you yesterday?

30
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,120
He wanted to propose.

31
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,400
But I stopped him.

32
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,000
Why?

33
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I don't really know either.

34
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,800
Do you have some other plans?

35
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,600
What other plans could I have?

36
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,400
If I get married to anyone in this life, it will be to Chen Yiming.

37
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,600
Then, why are you hesitating? You've been dating for 4 or 5 years.

38
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,400
Four years and five months.

39
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,300
Then, you should get married.

40
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,600
Liu Yang and I only knew each other for 6 months before we got married.

41
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,700
Zhizhi, from the time before you and Liu Yang got married,

42
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,100
are there things about your life as a single woman that it's hard to live without?

43
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,800
No.

44
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,400
Back then, I was really anxious to be with him.

45
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,500
But I...

46
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,400
When I'm with him, I really happy too.

47
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,800
But when I think about getting married,

48
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,800
think about how I'd be a wife, then a mother...

49
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,400
I feel a bit panicky.

50
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,400
Could you be overthinking it?

51
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,200
Maybe.

52
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,800
So here you are, Siyu.

53
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,700
- You're looking for me. 
 - Director Pan wants to see you in his office.

54
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,400
Come here. Everyone. Come over here.

55
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,800
- What's up? 
 - I just heard that they laid off some people in the department next door.  
 - Layoffs again?

56
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,800
 Tell me. Will our department be next? 

57
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,800
 - I'm wondering about that. 
 - Yes. 

58
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,200
 If this keeps up, we...

59
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,200
You're speculating, right?

60
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,900
Boss, the Administration Department laid off three more people today.

61
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,000
Don't worry. Those layoffs won't come to our department.

62
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,200
Boss, the Tactics Department laid off two as well.

63
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,500
That's true.

64
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,500
In those departments, there are three people to do the work of one. If there are layoffs, who else would they lay off?

65
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:24,700
In our Planning Department, each one of you does the work of three people. What are you afraid of?

66
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,200
You should get back to work on those plans for the Mid-Autumn Festival.

67
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,900
We need the price for social media, then there are replies from the advertising companies.

68
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,400
- Hurry. Get those to me. 
 - Hurry. Let's get to work on them.

69
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,000
- Let me tell you. 
- What do you think will happen?

70
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,200
- We can't go on like this. 
- Why?

71
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,100
- Hey. 
 - Thank you.

72
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:46,470
- What's up? 
 - After we left yesterday, did you propose to her?

73
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,400
No.

74
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,600
The high moon on a beautiful night. So romantic.

75
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,100
- Just the right atmosphere for a proposal. 
 - That's true, isn't it?

76
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,500
- Then, why didn't you act? 
 - I'm not sure.

77
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,650
If you're not sure, or is she unsure?

78
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,200
Maybe both of us.

79
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,800
Women... really need to feel secure.

80
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,330
She doesn't feel secure?

81
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,300
That's true. You're young, smart, and talented.

82
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,200
Everything about you is great.

83
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,200
If I were a woman, I'd be willing to marry you.

84
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,600
That's about enough.

85
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,500
You didn't come to see me just to ask me about the proposal, did you?

86
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,200
- Of course not. 
 - Go on, then.

87
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,000
Help me get a date with Gu Xiaoling.

88
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,200
What are you doing? You already have Gu Xiaoling's WeChat, don't you?

89
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,600
I've been blocked.

90
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,100
[Message: Blocked]

91
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,300
- That was quick. 
 - Help me out.

92
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,400
- I can't help you. 
 - Why?

93
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,800
If someone's blocked you, it means they aren't interested in you.

94
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,900
But I'm extremely interested in her.

95
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,700
The type of person Gu Xiaoling wants for a boyfriend

96
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,800
would scare you.

97
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,100
Maybe she'll come to value true love with me.

98
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,700
Wake up, okay?

99
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,000
If I can't make it work with her, what about her back up?

100
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,300
- You're not qualified. 
 - Then just in case.

101
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,800
How can you be so cheap?

102
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,100
That's just the way I am.

103
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,000
Right now, everyone in the company is worried about being laid off.

104
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,100
How do you have the heart to think about all this?

105
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,600
What do I have to be afraid of? I'm a second-generation rich guy.

106
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,400
When did you become a second-generation rich guy?

107
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,400
Doesn't my father's name include the word for "rich"?

108
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,400
- What's up. 
  - Please come to the Human Resources Department. 

109
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,200
Director Wang wants me to go to the Human Resources Department.

110
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,500
- Help me arrange a date. 
 - Go away. 
 - Arrange it.

111
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,700
I need to talk you about something.

112
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:57,000
Xing Dian stopped production yesterday.

113
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,400
What's the reason for that?

114
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,600
Not enough orders, financial difficulties.

115
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,480
Lubao's sales

116
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,500
have been steadily declining. If that continues,

117
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,300
we'll be the next to stop production.

118
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:24,200
Where do you think

119
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:28,700
the problem lies in our Sales Department at the moment?

120
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,600
It could be...

121
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,000
that we haven't been able to raise everyone's spirit of initiative.

122
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
How can we raise everyone's initiative?

123
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,620
Director Pan,

124
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:50,400
I need to think carefully about this before answering you.

125
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:57,400
I've already thought it through. I'm preparing to split the Sales Department into two parts.

126
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,000
You and Yuan Huizhong will lead each team.

127
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,200
In three months, whichever team's track record is best...

128
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,000
Remember this. Whichever team's track record is best, their team leader will become Director of the Sales Department.

129
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,300
- Me? 
 - You.

130
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,600
- Become a team leader? 
 - Not just a team leader.

131
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,940
I hope that you will work very hard

132
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:18,900
to become the future director of our Sales Department.

133
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,800
Your asking me to compete one-on-one with Sister Yuan...

134
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,900
- Is that appropriate? 
 - How is it not appropriate?

135
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:34,400
I've been at Lubao for 7 years. Sister Yuan has been here for over 10 years.

136
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,500
Lubao Company has never been a company that operates on seniority.

137
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,200
- But... 
 - I know

138
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,200
that the two of you have a good relationship, but you must remember

139
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,700
that if there is no competition in an enterprise;

140
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,600
and instead, we care that you feel good, I feel good, everyone feels good...

141
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,900
sooner or later, we'll be finished.

142
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,700
Does Sister Yuan know about this plan?

143
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,800
She will accept it.

144
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,900
Li Siyu.

145
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:11,000
In the beginning, why did you come to work at Lubao?

146
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,900
Was it just for a job? Or did you hope to

147
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:17,200
find a platform to show what you can do?

148
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,900
Now I've set this platform up for you.

149
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:22,000
For the rest, you'll have to depend on yourself.

150
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,100
Director Pan,

151
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,900
let me think this over.

152
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,600
- Siyu. 
 - Director Fang.

153
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,200
- Is Director Pan in? 
 - He is.

154
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,000
Our department only has eight people altogether and you still want to do layoffs?

155
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,900
This is the decision of the Board of Directors.

156
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:55,400
Every department in the company will be cut in half.

157
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,100
This method of treating everyone the same is very unscientific.

158
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,800
But it's effective.

159
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,600
Yes. Those departments that are overstaffed should have layoffs.

160
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:07,100
But every person in our department is already overworked.

161
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,500
If we don't make cuts in personnel,

162
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,300
the company might not be able to continue existing.

163
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:18,200
Let's do this. Before you get off work today, give me a list.

164
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,700
- I can't do it. 
 - Director Chen!

165
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:29,120
I recruited those people.

166
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,930
They've been with me for so many years.

167
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:34,620
They suffered a lot and also made lots of effort. But they didn't earn much money.

168
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,720
I already feel sorry for them.

169
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,010
Now you want me to lay them off?

170
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:41,860
I can't do it.

171
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:45,440
- You can't act impetuously. 
 - But as long as you are human, you can't avoid emotion.

172
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,160
But the company only values benefits.

173
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,590
All right.

174
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:56,980
If the company has to do this, I'll quit.

175
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,480
I can give you my resignation letter this afternoon.

176
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:11,160
Then you can give it to me now.

177
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,700
Ziting, where is Sister Yuan?

178
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,670
They asked her to join a meeting.

179
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,420
That much?

180
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,350
Are they robbers?

181
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,530
Where am I going to find that much money?

182
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:10,490
You can't claim the money from the insurance.

183
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:12,260
I already asked on my way here.

184
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:15,840
They said Lan Ke's car didn't have insurance.

185
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:18,840
Bastard!

186
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,280
You must not tell Yiming about this.

187
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,010
Why?

188
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:27,150
This is my own matter. It has nothing to do with him.

189
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:29,800
Didn't he already propose?

190
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:35,610
Based on what?

191
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:38,100
The roadshow you planned last month,

192
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,740
you get full of praise even from my department.

193
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:44,550
And last year...

194
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,730
The company faced a problem,

195
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:50,070
they forgot who the front fighters were to sort it all out.

196
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:53,550
How can Caijin Company gain today's fame?

197
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:56,850
- Isn't it all because of you? 
 - All right.

198
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:02,460
I just feel wronged for you.

199
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:05,170
You are the company's no.1 hero.

200
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:08,240
If they need to lay people off, it shouldn't be you first.

201
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,910
Right now, the company lacks money.

202
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:15,190
They probably have to lay off the one with high expenses.

203
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:18,020
He planned to cut my whole department.

204
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:21,530
I just walked into their trap by doing this now.

205
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:25,950
You are too simple. You were calculated by them.

206
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:27,730
Yes.

207
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:29,880
I was caught. What can I do?

208
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:34,140
It isn't that bad. Aren't I more relaxed now?

209
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:38,490
You're really leaving?

210
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,800
Headhunting companies have contacted me many times over the years.

211
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,670
They wanted to give me an offer with any condition. But I wanted to stay with the company.

212
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:51,760
I rejected them all.

213
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:54,250
Now it's good.

214
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:57,600
Now I am free. Finally free.

215
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:06,110
Don't tell Li Siyu yet.

216
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:09,510
- Why? 
 - There's no point in telling her.

217
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:13,440
I'll tell her myself when I get another job.

218
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:19,420
I felt so guilty the entire night for ruining Chen Yiming's proposal.

219
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:22,780
Turns out you didn't want to get married to him?

220
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:25,920
I did rescue you from a siege. You blamed me!

221
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,850
It's okay that you don't thank me. Will your conscious allow you to do this?

222
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:31,870
This is another thing.

223
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:34,190
I didn't plan your Lan Ke to perform.

224
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:35,950
You owe me anyway.

225
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:39,600
You are already married now if I didn't help.

226
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,790
Don't mention that.

227
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,910
I'm scared just hearing it.

228
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,330
What's wrong with a married woman?

229
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:53,670
Zhizhi, we're not talking about you.

230
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:58,620
Sister Siyu, I think...

231
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,730
the next time Brother Yiming proposes,

232
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:04,150
- don't hesitate any more and agree to it. 
 - I agree.

233
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:07,940
Although Chen Yiming is just so-so, he is more than enough to me.

234
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:13,420
I think marriage shouldn't be delayed.

235
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:16,450
A lot of people who dated for over ten years

236
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:18,460
didn't get married.

237
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,430
Let's not talk about this anymore.

238
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:24,010
We should talk about compensation.

239
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:26,610
What's your next step then?

240
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:30,580
I'm exhausted with the roadshows.

241
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:33,720
I will take advantage of this time to rest.

242
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,650
I will also keep an eye on suitable opportunities.

243
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:40,170
Did you not eat lunch either?

244
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:43,320
Here. I happen to have one left.

245
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:47,470
I'm going.

246
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:51,490
- Where are you going? 
 - Enjoying my beautiful life.

247
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:55,360
- You don't want your things? 
 - Put them in your house for now!

248
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:03,130
How are we going to pay that much money?

249
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:05,950
We have to even if we can't afford it.

250
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:09,290
We have a signed mediation agreement.

251
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:14,510
All of my money is here. It's ¥17,000-18,000 all together.

252
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,370
Isn't that purse pretty valuable?

253
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:20,020
That's why I have no money!

254
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:25,210
Sister Siyu, I have ¥20,000 savings with Liu Yang.

255
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:28,210
But I bought finance products with that money.

256
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:31,040
I don't know if I can withdraw it now or not.

257
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:39,900
- Where are you going? 
 - Buy a lottery ticket.

258
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,920
- Where are you going? 
 - To bump into luck!

259
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:52,500
- You are Liu Yang? You are a top student of the university? 
 - Yes.

260
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,770
Your memory is really good.

261
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:58,440
I don't have other strengths. I just love money.

262
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:02,530
Xiao Liu, I hope you can successfully complete this bidding job.

263
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:04,810
- Of course. Definitely! 
 - Stay assured, Director Lu.

264
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:08,560
I won't let the superior leaders down.

265
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,330
- Work had! 
 - For sure.

266
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:13,110
Go back. See you, Director Lu.

267
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:15,070
- Thank you. 
 - You are too polite.

268
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,940
Safe journey, Director Lu.

269
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,870
Supervisor Wang, it's too windy outside. Quickly get inside.

270
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,540
Liu Yang, not bad.

271
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,690
About the bonus,

272
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:36,680
I will ask the Finance Department to pay you.

273
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:40,050
You should hurry up. How many people you need,

274
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:42,020
how many other departments you need to collaborate with

275
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,850
in a report and I will check immediately.

276
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:47,670
- All right, Supervisor. I will walk you out. 
 - No need. Go back to work.

277
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:49,560
Yes, Supervisor.

278
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:55,360
Liu Yang, don't forget.

279
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,210
We will go to pick Yuwei up together today.

280
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:01,280
Wait! Wait!

281
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:06,740
Liu Yang, brother, I didn't notice that

282
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,880
you knew how to take advantage of the alumni?

283
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,070
- Director is also from Jiaotong University? 
 - Don't pretend anymore.

284
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:14,060
I really didn't know!

285
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:18,290
You are awesome! ¥50,000 bonus plus the team leader of the bidding team.

286
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,230
You made it with one step!

287
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:22,840
I just suggested a plan.

288
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,860
But you proposed what Director Lu likes.

289
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:30,860
Brother, the next step, preparing bidding documents.

290
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:33,850
if you don't mind me, I can help you.

291
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:37,500
No, no, no, Old Wu. What are you talking about? How can I bother you?

292
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,980
- What? You dislike me? 
 - Of course not.

293
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,830
Then that's a deal. I can learn from you.

294
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,790
Old Wu!

295
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:02,370
- Hello, Sir. May I know how many guests you have?
 - Yiming!

296
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:04,830
- I have a friend there. 
 - This way, please.

297
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,840
Okay. Thank you.

298
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:15,780
The traffic was a bit bad. What's going on with the car?

299
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,780
Has the loss assessment come out?

300
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:21,420
Not yet. They said we have to wait a few more days.

301
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:25,360
- Why is it taking so long? 
 - There have been a lot of car accidents lately.

302
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,460
I'm going to answer a call.

303
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,060
What do you want to eat?

304
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:00,890
- Like to order two coffees. These two. 
 - Okay.

305
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:03,330
- Okay, please wait. 
 - Thank you.

306
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,320
[Bank- Xiaoni]

307
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,640
[Bank- Xiaoni]

308
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,270
- Hello? 
 - Hello.

309
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:27,070
Xiaoni, I'm Chen Yiming.

310
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,860
Isn't Sister Siyu not there?

311
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:31,770
Siyu isn't here right now. She went to use the bathroom.

312
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:35,150
Mr. Chen, it's like this. I asked for her just now.

313
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:38,090
What's the amount of the loan she would like to apply for?

314
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:44,700
- Mr. Chen? Hello?  
 - How about I tell her to call you back later?

315
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,320
 Okay. That's it then.

316
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:12,760
This is your coffee.

317
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,930
Hello? Laozhou, I'm Xiaoling.

318
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:23,840
Hey, beauty, you finally remembered to call me!

319
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:28,060
I had some trouble recently.

320
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:30,800
Can you lend me some money?

321
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,560
You called the wrong number.

322
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:37,910
The the most correct thing I did was dumping you!

323
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:45,140
Jack, I'm Xiaoling.

324
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:47,740
Xiaoling, who are you?

325
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:50,050
 What's your relationship with my husband?

326
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,090
- Xiao Ping? 
 -Xiao Ping?

327
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:58,410
Xiaoping has already run away.

328
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:19,010
Something on my face?

329
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:22,160
How much is the compensation?

330
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:25,030
I told you. I don't know yet.

331
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:27,170
Li Siyu!

332
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,820
This is my business.

333
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:37,010
- You can't do this every time. As soon as you encounter a problem— 
 - I've been independent since I was young.

334
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:41,150
Yes, you are independent.

335
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:45,320
I really appreciate it. And it's also what I love about you.

336
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,880
But many things in the future, including me,

337
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,340
if you are too independent, it will create a sense of distance.

338
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,560
I know.

339
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:01,450
Siyu... you're not alone.

340
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:03,410
You still have me.

341
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,910
I know.

342
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:15,390
Okay, let's talk.

343
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:18,220
How much is the compensation?

344
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:23,790
A lot of money.

345
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:30,190
- How come? 
 - Both are good cars.

346
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,960
They have insurance, right?

347
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,210
Lan Ke's car was not insured.

348
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,560
Excuse me. We are recruiting students.

349
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:46,150
 Hello, you can take a look.

350
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:49,150
You said you can come by yourself. Why did you call me?

351
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:53,010
This is the teacher's request. The dad must participate in the shuttle every week.

352
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:55,970
Education is not just mom’s business, it's dad's business too.

353
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:58,840
I still have a lot to do.

354
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,670
I don't let you come every day, only once every week.

355
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:04,400
We should let the teacher know

356
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,190
that our family still attaches great importance to education.

357
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:10,400
Hello, excuse me. Our dance school is recruiting students.

358
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,240
It's very cheap, ¥300 per class.

359
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,740
Liu Yang... Look, this ballet class...

360
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,480
¥300 per class.

361
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,720
Do you think Yuwei needs this?

362
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,240
Okay.

363
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:27,220
That's right. Miao Miao is three years old and has started to learn ballet.

364
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:29,780
Our Yuwei is four years old now.

365
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:34,040
¥300 is a bit expensive.

366
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,080
It is expensive.

367
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:39,070
What's expensive? Even Miao Miao's

368
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:41,930
class is ¥500.

369
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:44,390
I don't agree with what you said.

370
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:50,070
Even if its expensive, we need it.

371
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:53,460
Even if she is not a dancer, it's good to practice her temperament.

372
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:56,770
Look at that girl. It's very good for her character.

373
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:58,720
- It's very important. 
 - Okay.

374
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:04,930
Why are you so generous today?

375
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,870
I got the bonus.

376
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:10,640
- Really!? 
 - Yes.

377
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:14,380
I forgot to ask you.

378
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,000
How was the report today?

379
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,630
You guess!

380
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:21,570
The supervisor is satisfied.

381
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:24,520
Not only satisfied but also announced on the spot

382
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,900
that I would lead the bidding.

383
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,900
Really!?

384
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:32,850
That means you became the team leader?

385
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:37,300
- Husband, I knew you were great! 
 - Look at you.

386
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:41,330
Just a team leader. I'm not a director yet and you're so happy.

387
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:43,510
The next step is the director, isn't it?

388
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:45,860
That's too far.

389
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,640
Let’s talk about bonuses first.

390
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,900
I got the  annual energy saving innovation first prize for my plan

391
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,500
and was rated by the company.

392
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:56,180
Bonus. ¥50,000.

393
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,880
¥50,000?

394
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,190
That's great.

395
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:02,170
I was thinking of

396
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:06,190
sending ¥30,000 to my mom and then set aside ¥20,000 for Yuwei.

397
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:10,160
Something big happened yesterday to Siyu and Xiaoling,

398
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,530
they are in need of money now.

399
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:17,530
Give your mother ¥10,000 and the rest to Sister Siyu.

400
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:19,490
This is not suitable, right?

401
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:21,590
What's wrong with this?

402
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:25,470
They are closer than my own sister.

403
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,350
Nothing.

404
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:58,160
4S shop often demands an exorbitant price.

405
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:01,550
At this price, we can discuss it with them again.

406
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:04,670
Yes, we can discuss this with them.

407
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:07,950
But it won't change a lot.

408
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:13,460
This matter originally doesn't have anything to do with Zhizhi.

409
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:16,370
As for Xiaoling, the money she earned over the years,

410
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:18,780
she spent it all on various specialty stores.

411
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:22,180
So, I have to pay the money.

412
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,820
I will pay the money.

413
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,890
I saved a little money before to pay for the down payment of a house.

414
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:38,690
I can take out half to pay for the compensation.

415
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:44,500
I can still afford it.

416
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,460
I know you can afford it.

417
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,710
But you will have no savings

418
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:51,830
after you pay for it?

419
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:54,210
I can earn more money.

420
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,590
I don't want to be excluded, Siyu.

421
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:06,900
I still think this is not good.

422
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:17,890
You have to let me pay at least half.

423
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:20,390
It's not a small number.

424
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:23,250
Yes, that's not a small amount.

425
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:25,090
Actually, it's not a small number.

426
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:28,850
But compared with a lifetime for us,

427
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:32,480
it's not much of anything, right?

428
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:41,270
Yiming.

429
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,570
Thank you.

430
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,990
But I have another condition.

431
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,770
Go on.

432
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:59,080
In the future, whenever you meet with any difficulty,

433
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,700
you have to tell me about it immediately and you can't hide it from me.

434
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,480
And even more important, you can't bear it all alone.

435
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,280
I'll do my best.

436
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,360
It's me who will do my best.

437
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:17,070
Then, I really do have a problem right now.

438
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:19,740
I'm telling you right immediately.

439
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:26,450
Tell me.

440
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:29,250
Miao Miao's mother.

441
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:32,400
I'm sorry about yesterday. Something happened to my sister.

442
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,740
And Yuwei had a problem and went straight home.

443
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:39,730
- Miao Miao, you're done with school? 
 - I'm so sorry.

444
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:43,010
- School's over. 
 - Hey, Miao Miao.

445
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:45,640
- Were you good in school today? 
- Miao Miao is so cute today. Look at that barrette.

446
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,270
 Yuwei's parents! 

447
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:50,040
Hey, Yuwei.

448
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,280
 - Good-bye. 
 - Good-bye.

449
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:55,650
Today, Yuwei had some problems with the other kids and isn't very happy.

450
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:57,590
She was in a bit of a mood.

451
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:59,370
But she's okay now. When you get home, you should console her a little.

452
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:00,700
- Okay. 
 -  Goodbye, Teacher. 

453
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:03,630
- Thanks for your trouble. See you tomorrow. 
 - See you tomorrow.

454
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:06,510
Why are you in such a hurry? Wait for me.

455
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:17,700
Right up til now, she hasn't said a word to me.

456
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,730
That's a dangerous sign.

457
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:25,070
You can't treat that lightly.

458
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:31,300
I... How have I offended Director Pan?

459
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:34,650
It doesn't have anything to do with you.

460
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:36,850
They're after me.

461
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:43,190
Ever since I came to Lubao, it was Sister Yuan who taught me

462
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:47,220
step-by-step how to talk to clients.

463
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:50,830
For me, Sister Yuan is the model worker in our office.

464
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:54,580
A competition between a tutor and disciple

465
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:57,190
really is a little difficult to navigate.

466
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:00,990
But...

467
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:06,050
if the Director of Sales will get stock in the company,

468
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:08,400
plus an increase in salary and year-end bonus...

469
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,670
that's enough compensation for a full year.

470
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:15,050
Plus, Director Pan will give you the title.

471
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:17,400
If you hastily refuse him,

472
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,180
that... that's not too appropriate either.

473
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,450
So, exactly what should I do?

474
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:34,480
Have you discussed it with Sister Yuan?

475
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,940
I haven't had time yet.

476
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:39,840
Call her and speak with her about it.

477
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:45,930
It's Siyu.

478
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:47,860
See what she says.

479
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,930
Sister Yuan, I have something important to discuss with you.

480
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:56,290
- Where are you. 
 -  I'm at the hospital. 

481
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:00,360
I have a fever. I'm getting an infusion of fluids.

482
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:03,100
Then, are you finished yet?

483
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:06,490
- Almost. 
   - Which hospital are you at. I'll come pick you up.  

484
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:09,330
- I'm at Blue Cross Hospital. 
  - Okay. 

485
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:11,090
See you soon.

486
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:18,520
Whatever happens, talk it over. Be clear, so there's no misunderstanding.

487
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,580
- I'm going. 
 - Okay.

488
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:39,350
- Zhizhi. 
  - Sister Siyu. 

489
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,120
 I have  ¥40,000. 

490
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:45,580
Liu Yang just picked up his bonus today. You can take it.

491
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,800
Zhizhi, you don't need to worry about this.

492
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,710
Yiming and I have reached an agreement.

493
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:51,930
The two of us will split the cost.

494
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:54,500
- I have something to take care off, so I'll hang up. 
 - Okay.

495
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:57,480
Then, go about your business. Bye-bye.

496
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,510
You weren't even willing to give it to her.

497
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:05,570
It turns out that Sister Siyu doesn't need it.

498
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:10,160
Since Li Siyu doesn't need the money,

499
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:13,250
let's give my mom ¥30,000 and ¥20,000 for Yuwei.

500
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:17,260
Give your mom ¥10,000 and leave ¥40,000 for Yuwei.

501
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:21,610
You want to give my mom less than the norm, right?

502
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:27,120
You can say that? We give your mom money every month.

503
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:30,070
We're never short a penny with that.

504
00:34:32,890 --> 00:34:36,360
Then, let's give mom ¥20,000 and give ¥30,000 to Yuwei.

505
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:41,960
Doesn't the roof on her home need to be repaired?

506
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,380
There's also my father's tomb which needs to be renovated.

507
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:48,350
What's wrong? Are you unhappy?

508
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:51,190
Did you have a bad time with your friends today and now you're sad?

509
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:54,850
Miao Miao and the others wouldn't play with me.

510
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,010
Why won't they play with you?

511
00:34:58,010 --> 00:34:59,700
I don't know.

512
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:02,100
If they won't play with you, you can play with other kids.

513
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,450
They're not the only kids at the kindergarten, are they?

514
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:08,480
You don't understand. Miao Miao and her friends are the best kids.

515
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,050
I feel at ease when she can play with them.

516
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:14,350
I don't think Miao Miao's mom is so great.

517
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:17,530
Miao Miao's mom just doesn't like to say much.

518
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:22,530
[You've been removed from the group chat.]

519
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:25,820
Why did the elite group kick me out of the group?

520
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:37,000
She's not even answering my call.

521
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:41,480
Yuwei, quickly.

522
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:45,280
Baby, change shoes.

523
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:50,730
I want to watch TV!

524
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,130
One episode, okay?

525
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,830
This is for Yuwei.

526
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:25,480
- I want to drink something with flavor. 
 - With flavor? Here.

527
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:32,340
What are you rushing around for after you get back home?

528
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,790
You eat first when I finish cooking.

529
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:38,460
You put it here when you finish.

530
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:41,530
I will do washing up after I come back. Just take care of Yuwei for me.

531
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:43,620
What are you going to do?

532
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:46,600
To meet Miao Miao's mom.

533
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,810
She is the head of the parents.

534
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:52,140
I have to ask her why she removed me from the group.

535
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,880
Is it necessary?

536
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,440
Of course!

537
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,920
I told you at the beginning that you paid money to find a rival.

538
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,780
You will see.

539
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:07,930
[Emergency]

540
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:13,760
Sister Yuan.

541
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:30,250
Siyu, thank you for picking Mengmeng up.

542
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:32,690
Why are you being polite to me?

543
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:40,320
- What did you eat for dinner? 
 - Instant noodles.

544
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,430
Didn't I give you the money to order takeout?

545
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:45,120
It's not good to order food in the school all the time.

546
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,980
- Have you finished your homework? 
 - Not yet.

547
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:51,240
Why didn't you finish it? Did you play digital games in school?

548
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:54,510
I told you that I did!

549
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:59,310
Kids nowadays have too much homework.

550
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:12,690
Directer Pan talked to me today.

551
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:15,380
I know.

552
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,680
What do you think about it?

553
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,620
I will listen to you.

554
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,520
Sister Yuan.

555
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,850
What's up?

556
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,620
Sister Yuan.

557
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:26,130
Nothing.

558
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:30,030
I just felt sorry for myself.

559
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:32,180
I'm unworthy.

560
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:34,100
I can understand.

561
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:40,840
It's been three years.

562
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:45,180
I drink, meet clients, go on business trips, and work overtime for them.

563
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:48,040
The business improves year after year.

564
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,480
But what have I got?

565
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:57,950
My husband went away with another woman.

566
00:39:57,950 --> 00:40:00,080
Mengmeng gets more and more rebellious.

567
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:04,880
I'm burdened with illness. People also spread rumors about me.

568
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,770
Sister Yuan, everyone knows,

569
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:09,810
you gave a lot to Lubao.

570
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:12,190
So what?

571
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:16,150
I should be the sales director no matter how you evaluate it.

572
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:18,750
Why did the company do this to me?

573
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,740
The company...

574
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:25,170
They probably have their own plan.

575
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:27,340
What plan for me?

576
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:37,390
I'm 35 years old.

577
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:41,120
If I can't get promoted this time,

578
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,520
I'm done for in this life.

579
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:47,910
Sister Yuan,

580
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:50,220
no worries.

581
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:52,040
The position is definitely yours.

582
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:56,540
I won't be the team leader. No matter who is becoming the team leader, I will always be on your team.

583
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,090
You thought it over?

584
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:04,380
I will make it clear to Director Pan tomorrow morning.

585
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,440
Siyu,

586
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:11,830
thank you.

587
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:14,650
Sister Yuan.

588
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:17,350
Take it back.

589
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:20,330
We have a 7-year friendship.

590
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:25,000
Thank you.

591
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:32,980
The kid is looking at you.

592
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:38,550
Let's get in the car.

593
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:15,440
- What's the matter?  Say it. 
 - Where are you? It sounds very lively there.

594
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,430
In the bar opened by Laomeng. Are you coming?

595
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:19,400
I won't go.

596
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:24,720
Haowen, didn't you tell me that one of your friends was a headhunter earlier?

597
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:29,870
- Forward the name card to me. 
 - I thought you wanted to rest and enjoy life?

598
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:31,990
Li Siyu has some trouble.

599
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:33,420
I can't take a break now.

600
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:35,830
You  haven't gotten the title of husband,

601
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:37,990
but you start to work as a husband.

602
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:39,900
Don't talk like an unconcerned person.

603
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:42,700
If this happened to you, you would also do the same.

604
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:44,900
It won't happen to me.

605
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:48,490
- Did you help me to connect Gu Xiaoling? 
 - You are here!

606
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:51,450
Let's go drink!

607
00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:53,940
Don't forget to send it to me soon!

608
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:55,850
Drink!

609
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,470
- You didn't heat up the food? 
 - It's okay.

610
00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:14,180
Miao Miao's mom taught me a lesson.

611
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:15,860
She?

612
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:20,930
- Why? 
 - It's all because of you.

613
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:24,350
You didn't take Yuwei to take part in the activity yesterday.

614
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:26,750
They kicked me out of the group.

615
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:29,140
They said we didn't have a sense of time.

616
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:32,030
We didn't respect the rules and other people.

617
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:33,970
Is she insane?

618
00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:36,300
It was definitely her that asked those kids

619
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:38,300
to exclude Yuwei.

620
00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:44,360
It's good to quit the group. We don't need to contact with this kind of person in the future.

621
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,240
I'm afraid that Yuwei will be upset by some unkindness.

622
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,960
You don't need to worry about this.

623
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,630
It's normal for kids to change playmates.
